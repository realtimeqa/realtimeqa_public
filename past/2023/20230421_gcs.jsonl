Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy — a towering, three-pronged vehicle that is the most powerful operational rocket in the world — returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2019.\n\nThe rocket launched at 9:41 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy debuted in 2018 to much fanfare as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk elected to launch his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars’ orbital path.\n\nSince that first test mission, SpaceX has launched only two other Falcon Heavy missions, both in 2019. One sent a hulking TV and phone service satellite to orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat, and the other delivered a batch of experimental satellites for the US Department of Defense.\n\nBut the rocket had not launched since 2019, as the vast majority of SpaceX’s missions don’t require the Falcon Heavy’s amped up power. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, on the other hand, has launched nearly 50 missions so far this year alone.\n\nWith each Falcon Heavy launch, the rocket puts on a dramatic showing back on Earth.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s mission, the company only attempted to recover two of the Falcon Heavy rocket’s first-stage rocket boosters — the tall white sticks that are strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff.\n\nAs planned, the center booster was left to plunge into the ocean, where it will remain, because it did not have enough leftover fuel to guide its journey home, according to a news release from the US military’s Space Systems Command.\n\nThe two side boosters, however, made their signature synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline.\n\nIn the past, SpaceX has attempted to land all three of the rocket’s boosters back on landing pads on land and at sea so that they can be refurbished and reused on future missions. It does this to cut down on mission costs. The company has yet to suceed at retrieving all three, although it’s come dramatically close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket’s center booster touched down on a sea-faring platform. But then, rough waves at sea toppled it over.\n\nAll about this rocket\n\nThough the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two massive rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title.\n\nNASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket, which is currently slated to attempt its inaugural launch later in November to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, is sitting in the Kennedy Space Center’s towering Vehicle Assembly Building, which lies just a few miles from the launch pad where the Falcon Heavy will take flight.\n\nWhile the Falcon Heavy gives off about five million pounds of thrust, SLS is expected to put off as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust — 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets that powered the mid-20th Century moon landings.\n\nAnd just across the Gulf Coast, at SpaceX’s experimental facilities in South Texas, the company is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators, it could take flight before the end of the year.\n\nThe Starship system is expected to out-power both SLS and Falcon Heavy by a wide margin. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust alone.\n\nBoth the SLS rocket and SpaceX’s Starship are integral to NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in half a century.\n\nSpaceX also has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in the hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there.\n\nAll about this mission\n\nThere is not much publicly available information about the USSF-44 mission. In a news release, the US military’s Space Systems Command said only that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of the Space Systems Command’s Innovation and Prototyping Delta, which is focused on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space as well as a range of other activities.\n\nThe Space System Command declined to provide additional information about the mission when reached by email. It referred questions to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which also declined comment.\n\nThe US military is one of the primary drivers of the domestic rocket economy, doling out lucrative launch contracts that are coveted by private launch companies including SpaceX and its chief competitor in the area, United Launch Alliance, which is a joint operation between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

The snowfall and blizzard conditions made roads impassable, froze power substations and left more than a dozen people dead, Erie County officials said.\n\nThe conditions eased slightly on Sunday, allowing emergency responders to get out and see the extent of the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to say that this is going to be it because that would be a fallacy for me to say that, because we know that there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than two days,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Sunday. “There are people in homes who are below freezing temperatures.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades. In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us. Since the start of the storm the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nPower grid struggling with cold\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nA power grid operator for at least 13 states in the country’s eastern half asked customers to conserve power and set thermostats lower than usual from early Saturday to 10 a.m. on Sunday because usage was straining capacity.\n\nThe operator, PJM Interconnection, serves about 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York. John Normile/Getty Images\n\nOut of the 17 weather-related fatalities recorded across New York, 16 were in Erie County, officials said, and one was a fatal carbon monoxide poisoning reported in Niagara County, according to the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nBlistering blizzard conditions swept the region, and Poloncarz, the county executive, said about 500 motorists found themselves stranded in their vehicles Friday night into Saturday morning, despite a county driving ban put in place during the storm.\n\nNational Guard troops had been called in to help “rescue people that are stuck in vehicles,” he said.\n\nOf the deaths reported early Sunday – with individuals ranging in age from 26 to 93 years of age – “some were found in cars and some were found actually on the street in snow banks,” Poloncarz said.\n\nTwo died in separate incidents Friday night when emergency medical personnel could not get to their homes in time for medical emergencies, Poloncarz said Saturday morning. Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday.\n\nHochul said she will ask the federal government “for a declaration of emergency that’ll allow us to seek reimbursements for the extraordinary expenses of all the overtime and the fact that we brought in mutual aid from other parts of the state.”\n\nPowerful winter storm leaves first responders in need of rescue, official says 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nOther storm-related deaths have been reported in the country. They include:\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building possibly looking for warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Kansas Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died in the state, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a caravan slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people have died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75, when a semi tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• Tennessee: The Tennessee Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Wisconsin: Wisconsin State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.\n\nWhat to expect as the storm slowly weakens and hazardous conditions continue\n\nStrong winds behind the arctic cold front that pushed through this week will lead to lake-effect snow and blizzard conditions at times across portions of the Great Lakes on Sunday.\n\nBlizzard warnings, winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories blanket much of the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley.\n\nAn additional 8 to 16 inches of lake-effect snow is possible.\n\nThe storm system is forecast to gradually weaken as it lifts into southeastern Canada, moving slowly during the next couple of days and pulling arctic air from Canada down into much of the eastern side of the country.\n\nThe Arctic blast will slowly moderate into Monday.\n\nThe cold temperatures combined with dangerous wind chills will create a potentially life-threatening hazard for travelers who become stranded, people who work outside, livestock and pets, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“In some areas, being outdoors could lead to frostbite in minutes,” the Weather Service warned.\n\nAs the frigid air continues to blast the warm waters of the Great Lakes, lake-effect snows and blizzard conditions are expected to continue, but slowly become less intense.\n\nStill, strong gusty winds initially up to 60 mph accompanying the snow downwind from the Great Lakes will continue to make for extremely dangerous conditions on the road.\n\nBy Christmas night into Monday, another low pressure system coming from the Pacific will deliver the next surge of moisture toward the Pacific Northwest and then into northern California, according to the Weather Service.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/03/nashville-tornado-news-latest-updates-damage-tuesdays-storm/4936920002/", "title": "Nashville tornado: Latest news and updates on damage, shelter and ...", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nRescue and recovery continues Wednesday after at least one deadly tornado ripped through Tennessee early Tuesday.

Families who had left damaged homes lie on a few dozen cots spread across the Sportsplex’s indoor tennis courts.\n\nHill and Wilkins, who live in Germantown, said the home was not damaged but they came to the shelter because they lost electricity. They initially took shelter at the Nashville Farmers’ Market, but then the market also lost power, so they moved to the Sportsplex. On Tuesday morning, their spirits were lifted by a visit from the governor.\n\n“It means a lot to me, at least,” Wilkins said. “You have people who say they are already here to help, but for the governor to actually show up for people who are displaced, it means a lot.\"\n\nHill and Wilkins said they were first notified of the storm by an alert on their phone in Monday night, but soon the weather outside became impossible to ignore. Strong winds were uprooting trees and streets signs and audibly snapping power lines. Tents from a nearby homeless encampment could be seen blowing down the street. Down the street, some entire buildings were leveled, they said.\n\n“If it would’ve touched down just a couple feet further, that would have been us,” Wilkins said.\n\n11:40 a.m. Man moving to Nashville left 'homeless'\n\nLarry Taylor moved to Nashville to live with his relatives on Monday. By Tuesday, he was “homeless.”\n\nTaylor, 58, said he and his wife drove into Middle Tennessee on Monday night on as tornadoes ripped through the state. As the hail fell and the wind roared, their car became trapped in traffic about 50 miles outside of the city.\n\n“The tornado came down the highway, so we saw poles falling and trucks turned over,” Taylor said, “but we couldn’t do anything about it because we had to use the light from the truck in front of us to keep going.\n\nEventually, Taylor and his wife pulled into n the parking lot of a shuttered gas station, then rode out the storm hunkered down in their car. When they finally arrived in Nashville on Tuesday morning, Taylor discovered his sister-in-law’s house – where he planned to live – was damaged to the point of being unlivable.\n\nAs of midday on Monday, Taylor was taking shelter at the Centennial Sportsplex on West Nashville.\n\n“I’m not real comfortable,” Taylor said, “but I’m thanking God for my life.”\n\n10:57 a.m. Governor visits storm-devastated Germantown neighborhood.\n\nAfter visiting the shelter set up at Centennial Sportsplex, Gov. Bill Lee and some Cabinet members walked the streets of Nashville’s Germantown neighborhood to assess damage.\n\nLee walked into a historic home on 7th Ave North, where the roof and entire front wall had been blown off.\n\n“That’s intense,” Lee said as he walked back down the stairs.\n\nIt was the first time he had ever seen such devastating tornado damage “up close,” he said.\n\nLee was then leaving to catch a helicopter to Putnam County.\n\n“Our heart is broken for many families whose lives were changed in an instant,” Lee said in an interview surveying the Germantown damage. “It’s tragic. it’s heartbreaking.”\n\n“We also know there’s great hope in the midst of suffering and difficulty and that’s what we hope we can help provide.\n\n“There are days ahead for Tennessee, post-this tragedy, that will show just who we are as a people.”\n\nEarly that morning Lee had visited both state and local emergency operation centers in Nashville and had been on the phone with the White House and members of Tennessee’s federal delegation in an effort to expedite aid.\n\nLee did not yet have an estimate on how how much federal aid the state would receive or how soon it would be available.\n\n“We know that because of the extent of this disaster there will be aid available,” Lee said.\n\n“What’s encouraging is the coordinated effort,” Lee said. “What’s tragic is what we see right here and what we believe we’ll see more of as the day unfolds.”\n\nThe state has deployed resources to rural areas hard, including sending generators and state troopers. The state is in communication with hospitals in those areas.\n\n“This is the sort of thing where initially government steps in, but the real work will get done by the people of Tennessee as they engage to help one another.”\n\nLee described Tuesday as “a day of assessment.”\n\n“We’ve really just begun to realize the extent of physical damage. We know that there may be even more fatalities as the day unfolds. There are missing persons, there’s search and rescue teams right now underway.”\n\nAs he looked at a crumbled, more than century-old building on the corner of Jefferson Street and 7th Avenue North, Lee talked to a small group of people who knew the owner.\n\nThe black-owned business was home to Music City Cleaners, a dry cleaning service, as well as The Lab, a new coworking space. The building was also used as an event venue.\n\n“It’s a historic structure that’s gone, but what we really see is lives that have been impacted in a negative way. There’s people behind that building. There’s people’s livelihood. There’s businesses. There’s startups.”\n\n10:52 a.m. President Trump says he'll visit Tennessee\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will visit the Nashville area after a deadly storm struck Middle Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he is scheduled to visit Middle Tennessee on Friday.\n\nDetails about the president's visit were not immediately available.\n\n\"We're working with the leaders in Tennessee, including their great Governor Bill Lee, to ensure everything is done properly,\" Trump said while speaking at the National Association of Counties on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our hearts are full of sorrow for the lives that were lost.\"\n\n10:40 a.m. North Nashville residents recount storm terror\n\nAs major portions of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street remained closed around Germantown Tuesday morning, long lines of traffic cams to a standstill on small side streets.\n\nSome residents took it upon themselves to try to direct traffic in the area around 10th Avenue North, where downed trees and power lines blocked streets with no warning to drivers.\n\nDrinking a Smirnoff Ice around 8 a.m. Tuesday, Domonique Hodge recalled hearing the roof come off his 14th Ave. North duplex earlier that morning.\n\n“That’s the roof right there, Hodge said, pointing to a massive pile of shingles and roofing material in the front yard.\n\nHe got in the closet, caught off guard by what was going on outside around him.\n\nAnother woman who lives in the house sat in a folding chair by the side of the road holding a baby wrapped in a blanket.\n\n“What’s there to say?” the woman responded, appearing numb, when approached by a reporter.\n\n10:40 a.m. Significant damage at Robert Churchwell elementary\n\nRobert Churchwell Museum Magnet Elementary School has sustained significant damage from the tornado that touched down in North Nashville on Tuesday morning, according to Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools spokesperson Sean Braisted.\n\nThe district is looking at relocation options for the school, which most likely will be Park Elementary, Braisted said.\n\nThe district is also assessing the damage at Meigs Academic Magnet School, and Lockeland Design Center Elementary School, both located in East Nashville.

The couple went into the downstairs laundry room to huddled together with their hedgehog and dogs, but they forgot one pet: their fish.\n\nAfter the storm went by their house, they discovered their first floor was annihilated.

The 2015 graduate lives up the street, her house mostly untouched.\n\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"I got the warning in less than 10 minutes. We huddled and we prayed. Then it was gone.

Crews also began damage assessments Saturday, the agency said. The death toll may climb.\n\nMuch of the worst impacts spawned from a storm that carved a devastating path northeastward across Mississippi and Alabama, according to AccuWeather. The rural towns of Silver City and Rolling Fork, about 60 miles northeast of Jackson, Mississippi, bore the brunt of the damage from a tornado.\n\n\"It is almost complete devastation,\" said Royce Steed, emergency manager in Humphreys County, where Silver City is located. \"This little old town...is more or less wiped off the map.\"\n\nWHAT WE KNOW:Mississippi tornadoes cause death, destruction\n\nBiden declares emergency as crews dig through storm wreckage\n\nPresident Joe Biden early Sunday issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi, making federal funding available to Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe and Sharkey counties, the areas hardest hit Friday night by a deadly tornado that ripped through the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions of the U.S.\n\nSearch and recovery crews on Sunday resumed the daunting task of digging through the debris of flattened and battered homes, commercial buildings and municipal offices after hundreds of people were displaced.\n\nFollowing Biden's declaration, federal funding can be used for recovery efforts including temporary housing, home repairs, loans covering uninsured property losses and other individual and business programs, the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe twister flattened entire blocks, obliterated houses, ripped a steeple off a church and toppled a municipal water tower. Even with recovery just starting, the National Weather Service warned of a risk of more severe weather Sunday — including high winds, large hail and possible tornadoes — in eastern Louisiana, south central Mississippi and south central Alabama.\n\nDeath toll rises in Mississippi\n\nAt least 25 people have died in four counties, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said in a news release Saturday. The agency said dozens more are injured.\n\nFour people who were reported missing overnight have been accounted for as search and rescue efforts continue, according to the agency.\n\n\"Multiple state agencies and partners are working together to help in the response and recovery efforts,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nWitnesses describe devastation in Mississippi town Rolling Fork\n\nThere are nearly 20 homes on Seventh Street in Rolling Fork with around 80 residents. Every home was a complete loss.\n\nJohn Brewer and his wife Joyce were sitting in their home Friday night on the street when the storm came through. Brewer, a long-haul trucker, who hauls munitions across the country for the U.S. military, parked his 27,000-pound truck next to his home.\n\nThe tornado, which destroyed Brewer's home, lifted the tractor-trailer off the ground and dropped it on his neighbor's home, killing L.A. Pierce and his wife Melissa. Emergency workers arrived on the scene as soon as possible, but the Pierces did not survive.\n\nVictoria Garland of Onward was in Rolling Fork with her husband early Saturday, trying to help residents grappling with the damage. She called it \"total devastation.\"\n\n\"A lot we could see was gone,\" she said. \"The skyline you grew up with your whole life is gone. The businesses we rely on are gone. We're definitely in shock.\"\n\nGarland said a Rolling Fork animal shelter was destroyed, but three dogs miraculously survived.\n\n\"I don't know how,\" she said. \"To find a live dog was unbelievable. It's just unreal.\"\n\nAt Chuck's Dairy Bar in Rolling Fork, owners and employees survived the storm by huddling inside the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator as winds berated the metal structure, Tracy Harden told USA TODAY. Harden, 48, answered a call to a phone number listed online for the diner Saturday.\n\nREAD MORE:Diner workers survived Mississippi tornado by sheltering in refrigerator, owner says\n\nHarden and her husband bought the decades-old diner 16 years ago, and it was a hub for the Rolling Fork community, she said. By Saturday morning, the beloved gathering spot had been completely destroyed and the only things left standing were the refrigerator and a bathroom, where one more person hid to survive the tornado.\n\n“I care so much for my town, and our business is the place to go, not just to eat, but to be loved on and be comforted during anything,” she said.\n\nRolling Fork Mayor Eldridge Walker told WLBT-TV he was unable to get out of his damaged home soon after the tornado hit because power lines were down. He told CNN his town had largely been wiped out.\n\n\"My city is gone,\" he said. \"But we are resilient and we are going to come back strong.\"\n\nBiden calls Mississippi tornado devastation 'heartbreaking'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he has reached out to Gov. Tate Reeves and spoken with FEMA and local authorities to offer federal support in recovery efforts.\n\n\"The images from across Mississippi are heartbreaking,\" he said in a statement. \"While we are still assessing the full extent of the damage, we know that many of our fellow Americans are not only grieving for family and friends, they’ve lost their homes and businesses.\"\n\nSearch and rescue efforts underway Saturday\n\nSignificant amounts of debris are blocking roads, the Mississippi Department of Transportation said. Patients from Rolling Fork's Sharkey-Issaquena Community Hospital were transferred to other hospitals after the building was damaged by the storm, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a state of emergency Saturday in all counties affected by the storms. He said in Twitter posts on Friday and Saturday that search and rescue efforts were continuing and authorities were surging more ambulances and other emergency assets to the area. He also said he had finished a briefing with disaster response teams and was headed to Sharkey County.\n\n\"The loss will be felt in these towns forever,\" he said. \"Please pray for God’s hand to be over all who lost family and friends.\"\n\nTornado reports in Mississippi, Alabama\n\nThere were at least two dozen tornado reports Friday across Mississippi and Alabama, including in Mississippi's Rolling Fork, Silver City and Winona, according to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center.\n\nIn Alabama's Morgan County, first responders are going door-to-door to check on residents. Crews rescued a man who was stuck in the mud when a trailer was overturned and six people trapped in a home, according to the county sheriff's office. The man who was rescued from the mud later died of his injuries, officials said.\n\nCentral Mississippi is expected to get more rain Sunday, with thunderstorms possible in the afternoon, according to AccuWeather. Severe thunderstorms may continue with possible large hail, damaging gusts and more tornadoes from far east Texas and central Louisiana into southern and central Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWhat to know about hard-hit Sharkey County\n\nWith a population of about 3,600, Sharkey County is a predominantly Black county with a high poverty rate. About 71% of the county's population is Black and 27% is white, according to 2021 Census data. About 35% of the county's households are in poverty, while the county has a median household income of just under $39,000. The nationwide median household income was $70,784 in 2021.\n\nIt is also a town that is no stranger to great challenges. The backbone of the economy is agriculture. In 2019, the Lower Delta suffered extreme flooding that lasted most of the year and few crops were planted. This left farmers without incomes, farmhands without jobs and little money circulating in the local economy.\n\nDeadliest tornado to hit Mississippi in over 10 years\n\nFriday's storm was the deadliest tornado to hit Mississippi since at least 2011, and potentially the deadliest in more than 50 years.\n\nThe Mississippi Gulf Coast has also been hit by a number of deadly and costly hurricanes over the years, from the storm of 1947 to Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe National Weather Service sent crews to survey the tornado, but preliminary information based on estimates from storm reports and radar data indicate that it was on the ground for more than an hour, said Lance Perrilloux, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Jackson, Mississippi, office.\n\n“That’s rare — very, very rare,” he said, attributing the wide path to widespread atmospheric instability. “All the ingredients were there.\"\n\nNighttime tornadoes are deadly\n\nNighttime tornadoes are twice as likely to be deadly as daytime tornadoes, scientists report. A 2008 study published by Northern Illinois University professors Walker Ashley and Andrew Krmenec found that nighttime tornadoes made up only 27% of all tornadoes from 1950 to 2005, but were responsible for 39% of all tornado deaths.\n\nIn fact, one in 32 nighttime tornadoes results in a death compared with one in 64 in the daytime.\n\nSome reasons for this are obvious, according to Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman.\n\nUnless lit by at least somewhat frequent lightning, you may not see a tornado at night, Erdman said. \"One challenge the meteorological and social science communities face is getting the public to take shelter immediately, without first 'confirming the threat' of a tornado by looking outside and wasting precious seconds to reach shelter.\"\n\nHe added that most people are at home and asleep at night and can be unaware of an approaching tornado threat: If you can’t see a tornado coming, it is more likely to kill you, and even more so if you have already gone to bed.\n\n— Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Wicker Perlis and Brian Broom, The (Jackson, Miss.)

For our latest coverage of Hurricane Ian, see updates from Friday, Sept. 30.\n\nClick here for a lite version of this page with a quicker load time.\n\nIan became a hurricane again Thursday evening after hammering Florida with heavy rains and powerful winds, leaving a rising death toll and thousands of residents desperately seeking rescue from the effects of one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history.\n\nThe large system, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm on its way out of Florida and into the Atlantic ocean, is expected to head toward the Carolinas and Georgia. Ian's sustained winds increased to 85 mph late Thursday and it could bring \"life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds'' to those states, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the storm caused a \"500-year flooding event\" and said Coast Guard helicopters were plucking trapped residents from the roofs of homes. Communities across the state were or will be swamped by the overwhelming waters, he said.\n\n\"The impacts of this storm are historic and the damage that has been done is historic,\" DeSantis said. \"We've never seen a flood event like this, we've never seen a storm surge of this magnitude.\"\n\nAt least 14 people were reported dead in counties across the state, a number that's expected to rise substantially. Sheriffs in southwest Florida said 911 centers were inundated by thousands of stranded callers, some with life-threatening emergencies. More than 1.9 million Florida homes and businesses were without power Thursday evening.\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses thus far range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nEven after Ian had weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to the Atlantic early Thursday, its outer bands were still buffeting the state. The storm flooded entire communities, leaving residents stranded in their homes after making landfall Wednesday with 150-mph maximum sustained winds – just 7 mph shy of a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale.\n\nMajor to record flooding will continue across central Florida and considerable flooding is expected in portions of the Carolinas and southern Virginia through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm previously tore into Cuba, killing two people and bringing down the entire country's electrical grid.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►President Joe Biden declared an emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal assistance for the state, according to a White House statement. Ian is located about 185 miles south of Charleston, South Carolina, and is moving north-northeast at 10 mph, the hurricane center said late Thursday.\n\n►The U.S. Coast Guard was searching for a group of more than 20 Cuban migrants after their boat sank in stormy weather near the Florida Keys. A U.S. Border Patrol agent tweeted that nine have been rescued and that the search for the rest continues.\n\n►Ian’s strength at landfall tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane when measured by wind speed to strike the U.S. It's tied with five other hurricanes that reached 150 mph — two in Florida, two in Louisiana and one in Texas.\n\n►Waffle House, known for always being open, said 35 outlets were shut down due to the storm as of Thursday morning.\n\n►Residents described the terror after a tornado tore through a condominium complex near Delray Beach on the Atlantic side of South Florida, ripping off roofs and turning over vehicles. \"I felt things blow past my head and face,\" resident Jim Travis said. \"When I opened the door, my apartment was destroyed.\" Read more.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET TEXT UPDATES : Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\n: Sign up here for text updates on Hurricane Ian. HURRICANE IAN TRACKER: Where is Ian headed? See the map.\n\nReenergized Ian expected to make landfall in South Carolina\n\nLike a villain in a horror movie, Ian is coming back to wreak havoc just when it seemed to go away.\n\nOnce a Category 4 hurricane, Ian was a tropical storm as it moved Thursday off the coast of Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean, where the warm water reenergized it. In the afternoon, Ian once again became a hurricane — meaning it packs winds of at least 74 mph — and is expected to make landfall once again, this time Friday in South Carolina.\n\nHurricane and storm surge warnings have been issued for the South Carolina coast because of Ian's predicted approach, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nForecast call for a storm surge of several feet and flooding in low areas along the coast, like Charleston, where Mayor John Tecklenburg warned residents: “Take this storm seriously. Tomorrow, stay home and stay out of harm’s way.”\n\nCollapsed causeway, shark swimming on a street part of Ian's legacy\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast were devastated as Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nSanibel Island in Lee County, near where the hurricane made landfall, was among the hardest hit. Parts of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed, disconnecting the barrier island of 6,300 residents from the mainland.\n\n“Sanibel is destruction ... it got hit with really biblical storm surge,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said.\n\nSanibel Island officials said two people died as a result of the hurricane. At a Thursday night news conference, the officials said members of at least 200 households remained on the island during the storm. At least 40 uninjured people were evacuated and another 12 injured ones were taken to hospitals.\n\nIn Fort Myers, the water on the streets of one neighborhood was so deep a shark was seen swimming through it. In Cape Coral just to the south, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water.\n\nAbout 70 miles north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital.\n\nAt least 14 deaths confirmed in Florida, toll expected to grow\n\nThe destruction and upheaval left behind by Ian has made it difficult to get an accurate assessment of the loss of life, but there are already reports of 14 deaths, and more are expected.\n\nTwo of them were reported by officials in Sanibel Island, where residents of at least 200 households declined to evacuate and rode out the storm.\n\nCharlotte County Commissioner Chris Constance told CNN Thursday afternoon there have been six confirmed fatalities in the county, which is just north of Fort Myers.\n\nAlso speaking to CNN, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said at least five deaths have been confirmed in his county, which includes Cayo Costa — the island near Cape Coral where the storm made landfall Wednesday.\n\nAnd a 72-year-old man in Deltona, about 30 miles northeast of Orlando, died after falling into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nConstance said four shelters in his county had to be evacuated because of structural damage, and many roads were impassable because of downed power lines or flooding.\n\n“It is the biggest catastrophe I have ever seen in my lifetime,” said Constance, speaking from Broward County in South Florida, where he traveled ahead of the storm. “This is unprecedented and I was in Punta Gorda through Hurricane Charley (in 2004). While that was devastating, this is so much bigger, is affecting so many more people.''\n\nBiden: Ian could be 'deadliest hurricane in Florida's history'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that Ian could be the “deadliest hurricane in Florida's history,” vowing the federal government will provide assistance “however long it takes” to ensure a full recovery.\n\n“The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life,” Biden said after he was briefed on FEMA’s disaster response at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.\n\nAt least 13 people were reported dead in counties across the state, though Florida officials have not provided an official death total from the storm. It wasn’t clear on what Biden based his estimate on the loss of life. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane killed up to 2,500 in Florida. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 killed 43 people.\n\n“We know many families are hurting today, and our entire country hurts with them.'' Biden said. \"My message to the people of Florida and to the country is that at times like these America comes together.”\n\nThe president said he offered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “the fullest federal support” in a phone conversation Thursday morning and told Florida mayors to “call me directly” if they need help.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHurricane Ian losses: $25-$40 billion\n\nHurricane Ian-related losses, mostly in Florida, range between $25 and $40 billion, the Fitch Ratings credit agency reported Thursday in an initial analysis of the damage.\n\nFitch said the losses could climb higher “depending on the effect of the storm in the Carolinas.” The storm made landfall Wednesday on the Gulf Coast and traveled across central Florida before exiting on Thursday as a tropical storm. It has since turned into a Category 1 storm and headed toward South Carolina.\n\nIn comparison to other storms, Fitch said Hurricane Katrina’s losses were $65 billion in 2005 and Hurricane Ida’s losses were $36 billion last year.\n\n- Sergio Bustos\n\nIan the 'ultimate villain' at Disney World; parks to start reopening Friday\n\nWhile Disney World was closed to guests Thursday as Ian swept across central Florida, some who were already staying at the park's resorts weathered the storm with limited staff and upset children.\n\nJan Tuckwood, who splits time between Lake Worth, Florida, and Charlotte, North Carolina, said Disney's Swan Reserve hotel felt like the Twilight Zone to her and her family.\n\n\"Disney World is as you would imagine it to be if an incredible amount of children have been pent up for two days and basically had their hopes dashed by the ultimate villain, Hurricane Ian,\" she said.\n\nDuring the storm, water started leaking into their hotel room on the 14th floor and they were relocated to another room, she said.\n\nDisney officials said the parks were being assessed for damage Thursday and operations would resume in a phased approach Friday.\n\n– Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nErosion-control rocks tossed by high surf\n\nIn Flagler Beach, county emergency officials reported damage to the end of the pier as a result of the high and pounding surf, the National Weather Service in Jacksonville said, adding that public reports indicated the surf was tossing erosion-control rocks over the beachside highway State Road A1A.\n\nAt Pellicer Creek near Marineland, the tide gauge reached a height of 4 feet over the high-water mark, which represents major flooding of the Intracoastal Waterway, as a result of storm surge. A Weatherstem camera showed flooding of the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience.\n\n-- Dinah Pulver\n\nIan as viewed through a peephole in North Port\n\nElizabeth Hayes watched the entirety of Hurricane Ian pass over her home in North Port, 50 miles northwest of Fort Myers, through a peephole in her shutters. The longtime resident says she was not prepared for the devastating flooding – and she knows more floodwater is on its way.\n\nHeyes said only the roof of her shed in the yard is above water. North Port residents are using small boats, kayaks and paddle boards to inspect homes that flooded along the Myakkahatchee Creek on Thursday morning.\n\n“We’ve seen it flood, we’ve boated in and out before, but this is devastating,” Hayes said.\n\nAirports closed, flights canceled\n\nMost Florida airports remained closed Thursday and numerous flights were canceled. Airports that are open are dealing with delays as well as cancellations.\n\nNearly 2,000 U.S. flights were canceled Thursday, and the highest numbers were across Florida, according to Flight Aware, which tracks flight status in real time. Travel through parts of Georgia and the Carolinas was also impacted as the storm moved north. Tampa International Airport officials tweeted that damage assessments were underway.\n\n\"We are closely coordinating our reopening with the FAA, TSA, airlines, and other partners based on roadway safety, facility readiness, and required staffing,\" the post said. \"We hope to have an update on reopening plans later today.\"\n\n– Eve Chen, USA TODAY\n\nSection of Sanibel Causeway crashes into sea\n\nA section of the Sanibel Causeway collapsed into San Carlos Bay, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people normally live. A mandatory evacuation order had been issued for the island ahead of the storm but authorities said about 200 households stayed behind.\n\nDeSantis said Thursday morning that more than 100 engineers in pairs of two will work to assess the bridges along the west coast of Florida.\n\nBiden issues disaster declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration to make federal funding available to affected residents in the Florida counties of Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Hardee, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, and Sarasota. DeSantis said he would ask that the declaration be expanded as more counties report crippling damage from Ian.\n\nAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help residents and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding also is available for debris removal.\n\nBiden said his administration was \"continuing to take swift action to help the families of Florida. ... I want the people of Florida to know that we will be here at every step of the way.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg dodged worst of Ian\n\nAfter thousands of people evacuated earlier this week, preparing for life-threatening storm surge, residents in St. Petersburg awoke Thursday to minimal damage.\n\nPolice directed traffic at intersections with broken traffic lights. Some trees had fallen, blocking roadways and taking down power lines. In Coquina Key, an island community south of downtown, a Norfolk Island pine had snapped in half, its branches scattered in a yard. Nearby, Dale Fredrick used a chainsaw to cut branches of another downed tree blocking a roadway.\n\n“It won’t take long,” Fredrick, 58, said. “Just little by little.”\n\nHurricane Ian tracker\n\nUSA TODAY's Hurricane Ian tracker will remain updated and offer the latest look at where the storm is headed.\n\nLee County sheriff fears 'hundreds' could be dead but DeSantis says nothing confirmed\n\nThe hurricane’s center made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of heavily populated Fort Myers in Lee County.\n\n\"While I don't have confirmed numbers, I definitely know the fatalities are in the hundreds,\" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said on ABC-TV's \"Good Morning America.\" \"There are thousands of people that are waiting to be rescued.\"\n\nPressed on the numbers, Marceno said, \"So far confirmed in the hundreds. Meaning that we are responding to events, drownings. Again, unsure of the exact details because we are just starting to scratch the surface on this assessment.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis attempted to downplay the sheriff's assessment, telling \"Good Morning America'' those numbers weren't verified.\n\nWHAT IS STORM SURGE?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\n“None of that is confirmed,” DeSantis said at a morning briefing at the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “What that is, there were 911 calls from people in their homes saying, ‘Hey, the water is rising. I’m going to go up in the attic, but I’m really worried.’”\n\n“Of course, those folks now are going to be checked on,” DeSantis said. “I think you’ll have more clarity about that in the next day or so, as (rescuers) are able to go to those locations and determine whether people need services.”\n\nMore than 1.9M Floridians without power\n\nMore than 1.9 million homes and businesses across Florida were without power Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Most of the homes and businesses in 12 counties were without power, although authorities said they were making progress in restoring electricity.\n\nDeSantis said the power grids in Lee and Charlotte counties will likely have to be rebuilt.\n\n\"Lee and Charlotte are basically off the grid at this point,\" DeSantis said. \"That's going to be more than just connecting a power line back to a pole.\"\n\nHospital roof partially torn off, fire station flooded: Damage in Florida\n\nParts of Florida's Gulf Coast saw major damage as Hurricane Ian swept through the state, damaging buildings and homes and flooding communities.\n\nWater coursed through the streets of Naples, creating giant waves that made roads impassable and flooded the city’s fire department. A video posted by Naples Fire-Rescue showed crews working to salvage equipment and firetrucks in more than 3 feet of water. In Cape Coral, about 30 miles up the coast, photos showed a sailboat washed up in the middle of a road near homes.\n\nNearby Fort Myers saw intense storm surge flooding coastal communities and the area around WINK News, a local CBS affiliate. Videos showed water reaching car windshields in the studio's parking lot and some of the storm surge leaking into the building.\n\nFarther north along the coast, intense storm surge flooded a hospital's lower level emergency room in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds ripped away part of the roof from its intensive care unit, according to a doctor who works there.\n\nWater gushed down from above onto the ICU, forcing staff to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of whom were on ventilators – to other floors, said Dr. Birgit Bodine of HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital. Staff members used towels and plastic bins to try to mop up the sodden mess.\n\nOfficials warned flash floods were possible across the state, which could lead to pollution and radioactive waste overflow.\n\nSAFFIR-SIMPSON WIND SPEED SCALE:Breaking down wind speed scale for hurricanes.\n\nHOW DOES HURRICANE IAN COMPARE:Category 5 hurricanes are rare. Is Ian's punch the worst U.S. has seen?\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Kate Cimini, USA Today Network-Florida; Jesse Mendoza and Kathryn Varn, Sarasota Herald-Tribune; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/weather/kentucky-flooding-deaths-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Eastern Kentucky: More help needed to reach those stranded by ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLast week’s flooding has killed more than three dozen people in eastern Kentucky, the governor says – and stifling heat will soon compound the challenges for people who are without power and stranded by washed-away roads and bridges.\n\nTemperatures in the region Wednesday and Thursday will climb into the 90s, and because of the humidity it will feel close to 100 degrees, CNN meteorologists say. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area from noon Wednesday to 8 p.m. Thursday.\n\n“It’s going to get really, really hot, and that is now our new weather challenge,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a news conference Tuesday morning.\n\nThe flooding, which began early Thursday when heavy rain hit an already saturated region, displaced scores of people from their homes, wiped houses from their foundations, snatched away entire livelihoods including farms and businesses, and left residents with catastrophic damage to their properties, vehicles and other belongings.\n\nAt least 37 people have died in the flooding, Beshear said Tuesday. The death toll is expected to go up, the governor said.\n\nBeshear for days has said numerous people are unaccounted for, in part because cell phone service was lost – and because the flooding took out rural roads and bridges that are in some cases the only access point for communities in this part of Appalachia.\n\nFinding the missing isn’t the only difficulty. Many people are stranded because of the washed-out roads – and there’s a desperate need to either deliver supplies to them or move them, a resident of flood-hit Knott County says.\n\n“I still have aunts and uncles that are stuck in hollers. They are diabetics. They need insulin,” Knott County resident Zack Hall told CNN on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I went to visit one yesterday – was lucky enough to get up there (and deliver supplies) with an ATV. But there was no road … and that’s what people need to understand, is the infrastructure here is just completely destroyed and it makes relief efforts” difficult, Hall said.\n\nThough cell service is being restored, some areas are still without it, leaving many unable to contact loved ones or emergency services.\n\nThe disaster also knocked out essential power and water utilities, which repair crews have been struggling to restore because of dangerous conditions and washed-out roads. More than 5,600 customers in eastern Kentucky were still without power Tuesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMore than 18,000 service connections were without water Tuesday and an additional 45,600 were under a boil water advisory, Beshear said.\n\nThe power and water outages are especially troubling for those who are stranded and don’t have easy access to supplies, Hall, the Knott County resident, said.\n\n“With the heat, once it dries up for the day, it’s just muggy, humid. … A lot of people on oxygen that don’t have power are already struggling,” Hall said. “I think the worst is still to come if we’re not able to clear paths and get to these people.”\n\nMore people with utility terrain vehicles are needed to help in the area, he said.\n\n“If they can just come and help, help us move things, help us clear paths, help us deliver water, food, medicine to people. (And) pull people out that want to leave the area – we just need as many hands on deck as we can have,” Hall said.\n\nTeresa Reynolds sits exhausted as members of her community clean debris from flood-ravaged homes in Hindman, Kentucky, on Saturday, July 30.

The City Hall was destroyed and everything inside covered by more than a foot of mud.\n\nThe town bank, pharmacy and post office were also flooded, which means residents, many of whom are older and still get paychecks and retirement checks through the mail or at the bank, are struggling to access their money and medication, Mayor Susan Polis said.\n\nThere is also barely any cell service and the internet is down, making online banking next to impossible.\n\nAccess to clean, running water is another major concern.\n\nRoad problems make it hard to know how many people are missing, governor says\n\nThe infrastructure challenges make it “incredibly hard to get a good, reliable number on those missing,” Beshear told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday.\n\n“The way this water came in … it swept some people miles away from where they were taken, and it’s going to be a process that will take weeks to account for everybody,” Beshear said.\n\nMore than 1,300 water rescues have been made since the flooding began, Beshear said. Rescuers have been battling the infrastructure difficulties for days as they work to reach trapped residents.\n\nIn one stunning video, an 83-year-old woman is seen being airlifted to safety by a Blackhawk helicopter in Breathitt County. A rescue team learned that she and four other family members were trapped in an attic Thursday, Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team spokesperson Drew Stevens told CNN.\n\nThe woman was unharmed, Stevens said, but a male family members suffered a broken collar bone and was taken to the hospital.

Tatman expects local schools boards in 11 affected public school districts will modify start days for the upcoming academic year.\n\nMany of the impacted schools were scheduled to welcome students back next week. Now, start dates will likely vary depending on individual districts and schools.\n\nAs soon “as the immediate needs of food, shelter, and clothing are identified and met and power and water services are restored, districts are beginning to plan their return to school,” Tatman said.\n\nEach school district “will create a plan that works best for their students, staff, the facilities available, etc. and virtual instruction may be a resource some districts may choose to use,” the spokesperson added.\n\nState grieving after several catastrophes\n\nFlooding is just the most recent disaster to strike Kentucky, which has lost more than 16,000 people to the Covid-19 pandemic and is still recovering from a tornado outbreak that tore through the state in December, killing more than 70 people.\n\nBeshear spoke at an event in western Kentucky on Monday for those impacted by the tornadoes and acknowledged that Kentuckians have been impacted across the state by deadly natural disasters.\n\n“The flooding in eastern Kentucky has been hard, just like these tornadoes,” he said, adding that natural disasters “tear at the fabric of who we are.”\n\n“I was at a breaking point the other night because that happens to all of us – it’s OK not to be OK,” Beshear said. “We’re going to get through it because we have to. We don’t have any other choice.”\n\nResident Louis Turner carries water to friends and family along flood-ravaged Bowling Creek, Kentucky.

The children were identified to CNN by their aunt as siblings Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8.\n\n“I went to the location of what used to be their home yesterday,” Beshear said of the family that lost the four children. “I stood there in front of what would have been their front door and I saw one of the kid’s swings in the back. I think the oldest one would have been in second grade. They didn’t even get the same time on this Earth as my kids have already enjoyed.”\n\nThe governor launched a relief fund for victims of the flooding and those impacted, the Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund, which will first go toward paying for the funeral expenses of those killed in the disaster.

Cleanup had begun in those areas while tens of thousands were also left without power, and heavy winds and tornadoes damaged buildings, especially in Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas and Texas.\n\nHere's what you need to know about this weekend's weather:\n\nThe West\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for a large swath of northern and central California on Saturday and Sunday as storm-weary Southern California is mostly spared by the weekend storm.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada, including the Lake Tahoe region, is expected to be hardest hit, with 1 to 2 feet of snow accumulations expected at lower elevations and 2 to 4 feet above 7,000 feet. Winds could gust as high as 50 mph, with up to 100 mph along the Sierra crest.\n\n\"If you come to the Sierra this weekend, you may not be able to leave for a while,\" the National Weather Service warned. \"If you become stuck in your vehicle, rescue may be significantly delayed.\"\n\nSome areas around Lake Tahoe have recorded over 50 feet of snow this year since the first of October, according to Shawn Carter, a physical scientist at the National Water Center.\n\nThat same storm is expected to bring snow or rain to parts of eastern Oregon and Washington, with accumulations between 5 and 12 inches in places like Toutle, Ariel and Lake Merwin, and more like 2 inches in places including Lower Columbia, Oregon.\n\nCalifornia residents snowed in after heavy snowfall\n\nAuthorities said some residents in the mountains east of Los Angeles may be stranded in their homes for at least another week as plows struggle against back-to-back snowstorms.\n\nAs the San Bernardino Mountains were slammed with waves of heavy snowfall starting late last week, residents have been left stranded without power, with collapsed roofs and running out of necessities like food and medicine. The National Guard was deployed to 13 California counties to aid recovery, but crews are struggling to clear roads and bring aid.\n\n\"I feel like I'm never going to get out of here,\" Marcia Woloshun, a resident of Running Springs in the San Bernardino Mountains, told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nSTILL DIGGING OUT:After epic California storm, towns remain snowed in\n\nMany without power in Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee\n\nHundreds of thousands of households remained without power in Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan on Saturday morning as a powerful winter storm made its way across the country.

By Friday night, it was continuing to pack 60 mph winds but was expected to weaken overnight and dissipate over North Carolina or Virginia late Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nFlash flooding was possible in parts of North and South Carolina and southeast Virginia Friday night, while the storm also threatened parts of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia with tornadoes through Saturday morning, the hurricane center added.\n\nTwo days earlier, Ian made landfall along Florida’s southwestern coast as a major Category 4 hurricane, ravaging coastal communities, turning roads into streams and leaving behind wreckage and debris.\n\nAs communities in the Sunshine State were beginning to pick up the pieces after the powerful storm, authorities in South Carolina late Friday began assessing the damage to their state. Authorities in Pawleys Island, a coastal South Carolina town roughly 70 miles north of Charleston, were cataloging the damage Friday night.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nTwo piers in the state – Cherry Grove Pier in North Myrtle Beach and Pawleys Island Pier – partially collapsed due to the storm. Water had receded on the two causeways, but Pawleys Island police announced they were not letting anyone back on the island until safety assessments were conducted in the morning.\n\nMore than 128,000 customers were in the dark across the state as of 9:30 p.m. Friday, according to poweroutage.us. In North Carolina, more than 330,000 customers were out of power and in Florida, more than 1.4 million.\n\nKnee-deep water inside homes\n\nIn North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Kyle Faust waded through knee-deep water inside his home Friday after the storm roared through. Across Horry County, where the city is located, officials reported Friday night crews were conducting damage assessments and clearing debris, while some roads remained closed.\n\nMyrtle Beach Police urged residents to stay inside and not drive on flooded roadways.\n\n“It’s a pretty scary sight,” Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune remarked earlier of Hurricane Ian. “I’m seeing way too many cars passing by. And I think people just don’t realize how dangerous it is to be out in these types of conditions. We’ve seen so many people’s cars get stuck, and emergency personnel has to go out and rescue people.”\n\nShelters in Charleston County will remain open until 4 p.m. on Saturday, the county wrote in a news release. Buses will start taking people from the shelters back to the original pick-up locations Saturday morning.\n\n“A lot of prayers have been answered,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. “This storm is not as bad as it could have been, but don’t let your guard down yet. We are not out of the woods, there is water on the roads, still heavy winds, and it is still dangerous in many parts of the state.”\n\nCharleston International Airport’s airfield closed Friday because of high winds and extended the closure until Saturday morning, the airport said.\n\nIn Florida: At least 45 reported dead\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, confronted the dizzying destruction Ian wrought through much of the peninsula Wednesday and Thursday after it smashed into the southwest coast and plowed through central and northeastern areas.\n\nAt least 45 deaths have been reported in the state. Among them, friends of Kevin Behen, who told CNN on Friday night he knew of two men who died making sure their wives were able to escape the home they were all sheltering in that began to flood.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen explained. “They just looked at their wives and they said, ‘We can’t hold on anymore, we love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nHomes on the coast were washed out to sea, buildings were smashed throughout the state, and floodwater ruined homes and businesses and trapped residents, even inland in places like the Orlando area.\n\nHundreds of rescues have taken place by land, air and sea, with residents stuck in homes or stranded on rooftops, and searchers have made many wellness checks, especially in the Fort Myers and Naples areas, where a storm surge inundated streets and homes.\n\n“It looked as though someone had just dropped from the sky picked up hotels and buildings and took them away,” Lee County manager Roger Desjarlais said. “We also know that not as many people evacuated from those islands as we had hoped for. We know there has to be many fatalities yet to be accounted for.”\n\nIan may have caused as much as $47 billion in insured losses in Florida, according to an estimate from property analytics firm CoreLogic, which could make it the second-most expensive storm in the state’s history when adjusted for inflation after 1992’s Hurricane Andrew.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida as it deals with the devastation caused by the storm, which he noted was “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history” and will likely take “months, years” to rebuild.\n\nAnd the storm’s aftermath poses new, deadly dangers of its own. Some standing water is electrified, officials warned, while maneuvering through debris-strewn buildings and streets – many without working traffic signals – risks injury. Lack of air conditioning can lead to heat illness, and improper generator use can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nMany without homes, water, power\n\nClaudette Smith, the public information officer for the sheriff’s office in Charlotte County, just north of Fort Myers, told CNN the county is in desperate need of help as emergency services continue to be inundated.\n\n“We need everything, to put it plain and simple. We need all hands on deck,” Smith stressed. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nMany members of the community are without homes, water, and electricity, and there is currently only one operating hospital in the county.\n\nHere’s what to know about the destruction in Florida:\n\n• Deaths in Florida: At least 45 deaths suspected to be related to Ian have been reported in Florida, including 16 in Lee County, 12 in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, four in Volusia County, one in Polk County, one in Lake County, one in Manatee County and two in unincorporated Sarasota County, according to officials. Unconfirmed death cases are being processed by local medical examiners, who decide whether they are disaster-related, state emergency management Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\n• Hundreds of rescues and thousands of evacuations: The US Coast Guard has performed over 275 rescues in Florida, Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson told CNN. More than 700 rescues have happened across Florida so far, the governor reported Thursday, and thousands of evacuees have been reported. In Lee County, a hospital system had to evacuate more than 1,000 patients after its water supply was cut off, while other widespread evacuations have been reported in prisons and nursing homes. In Fort Myers, the fire chief was “pretty comfortable” by Friday morning everyone needing help there had been rescued, Mayor Kevin Anderson said. The Coast Guard is treating this like a military operation searching “block by block to make sure that everybody gets out.”\n\n• Historic flooding: Record flooding was recorded across central and northern Florida, including at least three rivers hitting all-time flood records. Officials in Orlando warned residents of dangerous flooding, which exceeded a foot in some areas.\n\n• Much of Fort Myers Beach obliterated: A helicopter flight over Fort Myers Beach shows utter devastation: empty or debris-littered lots where homes and businesses used to be and boats tossed into mangroves. “You’re talking about no structure left. … You’re talking about homes that were thrown into the bay. This is a long-term fix, and it’s life-changing,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.\n\n• Coastal islands isolated from mainland: Sanibel and Captiva islands in southwest Florida are cut off from the mainland after several parts of a critical causeway were torn away. At least two people were killed in the storm in Sanibel, and the bridge may need to be completely rebuilt, local officials said. Chip Farrar, a resident of the tiny island of Matlacha, told CNN 50 feet of road essential to reaching the mainland bridge has been washed out, and a second nearby bridge has also collapsed.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Alaa Elassar Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Alaa Elassar", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/weather/hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Fiona reaches Category 4 as it moves north, leaving ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Category 4 Hurricane Fiona poised to sideswipe Bermuda later this week, people in the storm’s deadly wake still faced days without basic utilities late Wednesday – including much of Puerto Rico, where most were left without power and running water.\n\nMore than a million people in Puerto Rico still had no power by Wednesday afternoon, according to the island’s emergency portal system. And more than 450,000 people across the island were without water service or with intermittent service as of Wednesday night, according to the website.\n\nWater is the top concern for residents like Carlos Vega, whose town of Cayey in the mountains of east-central Puerto Rico faced not only utility outages but also partially collapsed roads – an effect of the major flooding and more than 2 feet of rain that parts of Puerto Rico were hit with.\n\n“(Being without) power … we can face that and we can deal with that. The biggest concern is with our water. Can’t live without water,” Vega told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFiona killed at least five people in the Caribbean as it tore through the region last weekend and into this week, including one in Guadeloupe, two in Puerto Rico and two in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFiona also whipped parts of the Turks and Caicos islands on Tuesday with sustained winds of almost 125 mph, officials said. That left many areas without power, including on Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos, said Anya Williams, the acting governor of the islands. Authorities were able to begin visiting several islands and begin repairs.\n\nA fallen palm tree lies in the Ports of Call Resort entrance in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands. Vivian Tyson/AP\n\nNo deaths had been reported in Turks and Caicos as of Wednesday evening, Williams said in an update.\n\nFiona’s flooding especially left critical infrastructure damage in Puerto Rico and then the Dominican Republic, which the storm crossed Monday. More than 1 million utility customers in the Dominican Republic had no water service as of Wednesday morning, and more than 349,000 customers were without power, according to Maj. Gen. Juan Méndez García, director of the country’s emergency operations center.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of Puerto Rico, where hundreds of thousands remained without power, reached heat indices – what the air feels like when combining temperature and humidity – of 105 to 109 degrees Wednesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Shackelford.\n\nThe landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday came nearly five years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, leaving thousands dead and cutting power to and water service to more than 1 million people for what would become months.\n\nStorm presses north and could threaten Bermuda and Atlantic Canada\n\nFiona, after its center passed the Turks and Caicos as a Category 3 storm, strengthened to Category 4 – sustained winds of at least 130 mph – early Wednesday over the Atlantic.\n\nBy around 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, it was centered about 605 miles southwest of Bermuda, heading north with sustained winds of 130 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona is expected to strengthen some through Wednesday night and approach Bermuda late Thursday, potentially still as a Category 4 storm, forecasters said.\n\n“Fiona is forecast to be a hurricane-force cyclone through Saturday,” the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona’s powerful center is currently expected to pass west of Bermuda, sparing the British island territory its worst winds. But sustained winds of at least tropical-storm force – 39 to 73 mph – are expected to reach Bermuda by late Thursday or early Friday, the center said.\n\nThe US State Department issued a travel advisory Tuesday urging US citizens to reconsider travel to Bermuda because of the storm. The department also authorized family members of US government personnel to leave the island in anticipation of the storm.\n\nThough the storm isn’t expected to track near the US East Coast, it could generate onshore waves of 8 to 10 feet there over the weekend, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Wednesday.\n\n“It’s not a good weekend to go to the shore and get in the water – it’s time to stay out of the water,” Myers said of the East Coast.\n\nFiona could affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, potentially hammering the region with high winds, storm surge and heavy rainfall. A storm surge is expected to bring up water levels along Bermuda’s coast starting late Thursday.\n\n“Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,” the hurricane center said.\n\nThe storm has strengthened over the past few days – it made landfall in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a Category 1 hurricane before battering both with outer bands as it moved over water and toward the Turks and Caicos as a storm in Categories 2 and 3.\n\nNicasio Gil walks through the stagnant water left by the swollen Duey River while grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Higuey, Dominican Republic, on Tuesday, September 20.

I managed to cover them with something and block them with a washing machine,” she told Noticias SIN this week.\n\nAnother woman in Nizao who was clearing mud from belongings told Noticias SIN that she was frustrated because flooding frequently damages the region. This week, she left all belongings behind when floodwater encroached, she said.\n\n“We can’t take it any longer. Every year we lose our bed, clothes, food, everything,” the second woman told Noticias SIN.\n\nMore than 610 homes in the Dominican Republic have been destroyed, and some communities were cut off from aid due to the storm, said García, the nation’s emergency operations center director.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said on Twitter Wednesday that the federal government has approved a major disaster declaration request for the island, which ensures additional help from FEMA.\n\nThough US President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration Sunday, a major disaster declaration will bring additional resources – primarily individual assistance in the form of funding for housing and other needs, as well as public assistance to provide for the permanent rebuilding of damaged infrastructure.\n\nRestoration crews face challenges\n\nThe governor expected “a large portion of the population” would have power restored by late Wednesday, with the exception of the island’s southern region, which has suffered the most severe damage, he said Tuesday.\n\nBut restoration crews faced challenges: Many lines thought to have been repaired were temporarily knocked back offline because of various equipment issues, according to Josué Colón, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.\n\nCrews could also encounter issues that require a pause in work so that an already impaired grid is not overloaded, a spokesman for the power provider, LUMA Energy, said Wednesday.\n\nPierluisi will take an aerial tour of the island with Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell, he said. Criswell arrived on Tuesday to determine what additional federal help is needed, and that day surveyed damage with the governor in the city of Patillas.\n\n“The community there … (had) severely impacted roads, and bridges were damaged. Water was flooding the streets, and … other parts of the community (were) inaccessible,” Criswell said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n“But I also saw a resilient Puerto Rico,” she said. “I met with a woman named Anna, who opened up her own home in her own driveway to help create a path for the community. With the bridge that was washed away, her home became that pathway to help give food and water to the rest of her community.”\n\nNational Guards direct traffic in Cayey, Puerto Rico, as resident Luis Noguera helps clear the road. Stephanie Rojas/AP\n\nThe storm is a catastrophic blow to Puerto Rico, which was still recovering in some areas from when Hurricane Maria ripped through the island in 2017, inflicting widespread infrastructure damage and destroying homes.\n\nThe damage caused by Fiona is “devastating” and “catastrophic” in the island’s center, south and southeast regions, Pierluisi said Tuesday.\n\nAcross the island, more than 800 people were housed in dozens of shelters Wednesday, according to Puerto Rico’s Housing Secretary, William Rodriguez.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe Melissa Alonso", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/23/storm-brings-snow-rain-and-blizzard-warning-for-ventura-county/69937965007/", "title": "Storm brings snow, rain and blizzard warning for Ventura County", "text": "The coldest storm so far this season brought snow, rain and freezing temperatures to Southern California this week. Here's the latest news and photos from around Ventura County and the region:\n\nGrapevine reopens\n\nTraffic officials reopened the Grapevine Sunday afternoon after sunny skies melted ice.\n\nNational Weather Service officials said a weaker storm moving into the region Sunday night may impact the Grapevine again. Snow levels will be lowest on Tuesday and Wednesday, forecasts indicate.\n\nGrapevine closed into Sunday afternoon\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officials from the Fort Tejon office said ice buildup will keep the Grapevine closed through Sunday morning.\n\nThey hope to open the route sometime Sunday afternoon.\n\nSunday morning Grapevine status\n\nAs of 6:30 a.m. Sunday, the Grapevine section of I-5 remained shut by snow and ice, among other routes, Caltrans reported.\n\nFor Ventura County travelers considering heading north to reach Interstate 5, Highway 166 north of Santa Maria, which connects Highway 101 to the 5, also remained shut Sunday morning, according to Caltrans road information.\n\nHighway 33 north of Ojai remains closed through Los Padres National Forest as it has been since early January storms damaged the route.\n\nChilly night ahead\n\nWith most rain and snow in the rear view Saturday night, the exiting storm system will still leave its chilly fingerprint behind.\n\nOvernight lows Saturday into Sunday are expected to dip toward 40 degrees or the high 30s in Ventura County's coastal areas, said Rose Schoenfeld, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nFurther inland, temps will droop to near freezing in the Fillmore and Piru areas, with lows in the mid-30s, she said.\n\nMoorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks could see lows in the high 30s.\n\nA chance of showers continues along with more sprinklings of snow in mountain areas.\n\nIn the Grapevine area, temperatures are forecast to stay below freezing overnight, keeping existing snow on the ground in place, Schoenfeld said.\n\nThe accumulated snow, coupled with the possibility of more snowfall and fewer winter-weather resources than areas where snow is commonplace have all contributed to the Grapevine's overnight closure, she said.\n\nSnow to keep Grapevine closed overnight Saturday\n\nThe tail end of a cold storm will keep Interstate 5 along Tejon Pass closed overnight, Caltrans officials announced Saturday evening.\n\nThe mountainous corridor that connects Ventura and Los Angeles counties to the Central Valley — the so-called Grapevine — remained impacted by snow, with more snowfall expected, the state traffic agency said.\n\nOfficials had no estimate for when the route might open.\n\nGrapevine...still closed\n\nSnow kept the Grapevine close as of 5 p.m. Saturday, Caltrans officials said.\n\nHighway 166 north of Santa Maria, which connects Highway 101 and Interstate 5 and serves as a detour when the Grapevine is shut, also remained closed.\n\nSome other regional routes, including Highway 14 in the Santa Clarita area, had reopened.\n\nTopanga Canyon Boulevard had also reopened after a mudslide closed it earlier Saturday, the state traffic agency reported.\n\nSnow-capped peaks in the 805 proved too powerful a draw to keep motorists away, reporter John Palminteri noted when tweeting photos of cars jamming Gibraltar Road in Santa Barbara County despite \"road closed\" signs and barriers.\n\nMud closes Topanga Canyon Blvd.\n\nCaltrans officials said early Saturday afternoon a mudslide had closed Topanga Canyon Boulevard from Pacific Coast Highway to Grand View Drive, blocking a route inland from PCH east of Malibu.\n\nGrapevine snow continues\n\nSnow continues to block the Grapevine, Caltrans officials said shortly after noon on Saturday.\n\nRegional four-day snowfall totals as of 10 a.m. Saturday showed Mount Wilson, elevation 5,700 feet, getting 35 feet of snow, that National Weather Service reported. Frazier Park had 23 feet.\n\nEstimates for Ventura County mountains weren't immediately available.\n\nRainfall totals\n\nThe storm's heaviest rain had passed through Ventura County by Saturday morning, said meteorologist Rich Thompson of the National Weather Service, although showers could linger. Thunderstorms and bouts of heavy rain were still possible.\n\nHere are some four-day rainfall totals for Ventura County as of 10:20 a.m. Saturday, per the weather service:\n\nMatilija Dam, 10.67 inches\n\nWestlake Village, 6.25\n\nThousand Oaks, 5.82\n\nPiru, 4.87\n\nFillmore, 3.72\n\nSanta Paula, 3.69\n\nSaticoy, 3.4\n\nCSU Channel Islands, 3.31\n\nLa Conchita, 3.13\n\nMoorpark, 3.05\n\nSimi Valley, 3.02\n\nOxnard Civic Center, 2.87\n\nVentura, 2.8\n\nOjai, 2.15\n\nCamarillo Airport, 2.14\n\nSunday should be mostly clear before more rain arrives Monday through Wednesday, Thompson said, but the incoming storm won't be as powerful.\n\nFrozen things from the sky\n\nHail and graupel reports in the east county popped on up Twitter late Saturday morning, including at the California Highway Patrol office in Moorpark.\n\nAnd hat tip to ReporterDawn, formerly of the Star and the Acorn, for meteorological acumen while sharing graupel in Agoura.\n\nHelicopter view\n\nVentura County's Aviation Unit posted videos of recent activity involving helicopter crews.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Copter 9 flew over Matilija Dam as the crew surveyed rivers and roads:\n\nOvernight, a county helicopter helped search from above when RVs in the Valencia area were washed into a river:\n\nSnow and ice cover Grapevine\n\nThe California Highway Patrol's office at Fort Tejon tweeted photos of the Grapevine Saturday morning covered with snow and ice.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., officials had no estimated time for the mountainous Interstate 5 corridor to reopen.\n\nEvacuation warnings assessed\n\nPatrick Maynard, who directs Ventura County's Office of Emergency Services, said Saturday morning he had reviewed the status of the county's evacuation warnings initially issued Thursday.\n\nMaynard provided an update shortly before 9 a.m.:\n\nCamp Chaffee near Casitas Vista Road: Will remain under an evacuation warning until 3 p.m. Saturday to allow time for the creek to recede.\n\nCreek Road/Old Creek outside Ojai: Evacuation will be lifted at 9 a.m. Some mud and debris remains in the roadway in both areas; however, nothing hazardous is present.\n\nMatilija Canyon Road: The road remains impassable due to water flow but debris looks minimal compared to January's storms. A helicopter copter will launch around 9 a.m. to do an aerial recon of the area so officials can further evaluate the status of the roadway. The area will remain under an evacuation warning until further notice.\n\nThe bulk of the rain system had made its way through Ventura County as of Saturday morning, Maynard said. Officials expect isolated showers, windy conditions and possibly a thunderstorm over the next 18 hours.\n\nNo significant threat of issues remain, he said. More information is available at the emergency services website at vcemergency.com.\n\nGrapevine closed\n\nSnow again closed the Grapevine early Saturday, the California Highway Patrol and Caltrans reported.\n\nAs of 7:30 a.m., there was no estimated duration.\n\nMotorists had been advised to use Highway 101 as an alternate route since Highway 114 in Santa Clarita was closed by snow, Caltrans said around 7:45 a.m., and highways 58 and 138 were also closed.\n\nHighway 166 north of Santa Maria, which closed Friday, also remained closed as of Saturday morning, closing off a route from Highway 101 to Interstate 5.\n\nSuch closures often slow Highway 101 in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties as more vehicles, including big rigs, use the coastal corridor.\n\nVentura River flood warning\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of flooding on the Ventura River as of about 12:15 a.m. Saturday, with the warning lasting until 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMeasurements taken near Foster Park showed a crest near 19 feet, with possible impacts on Highway 101 near downtown Ventura.\n\nWater rescue near Ojai\n\nFirefighters responded to a rescue near Ladera Road northeast of Ojai city limits around 10:35 p.m. Friday, where people were said to be stuck in a vehicle.\n\nA sheriff's helicopter had been called in but was cancelled, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. William Hutton.\n\nUltimately, a helicopter and rescue swimmer did rescue a driver from the vehicle, the Ventura County Fire Department reported.\n\nSeparately, shortly before midnight California Highway Patrol officials had requested a closure of Highway 150 from west of Santa Ana Road, near Lake Casitas, to Gobernador Canyon Road near Carpinteria.\n\nWater-rescue crews called out in Ventura\n\nFirefighters responded to a water rescue along the Ventura River around 10:15 p.m. , staging near Main and Peking streets in Ventura.\n\nRadio traffic from the scene indicated two people were stuck on an island south of the bridge. They did not appear to be immediately at risk from the water.\n\nThunderstorm warning includes Simi, TO\n\nStorm activity continued in the east county as of 10 p.m. Friday, with the National Weather Service issuing a severe thunderstorm warning until 10:45 p.m.\n\nTrees downed around Thousand Oaks\n\nAround 9 p.m. Friday, authorities responded to a number of downed trees and minor crashes in Thousand Oaks.\n\nA car crashed into a downed tree at Lynn Road and Avenida de los Arboles shortly before 9 p.m. The driver suffered minor injuries and did not need to be taken to the hospital, said Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. William Hutton.\n\n\"There are just a lot of downed trees calls,\" he said. The sheriff's office is contracted with Thousand Oaks for police services.\n\nAfter 9:30 p.m., four homes in the 200 block of Yellowstone Avenue in Thousand Oaks were evacuated after a tree fell and caused a gas leak, according to authorities. Few additional details were available.\n\nTrees, rocks, mud impact roads around county\n\nEmergency responders were busy Friday night as reports of flooded roads, fallen trees, downed power lines, rocks and mud impacted streets and highways around Ventura County.\n\nSome callers also reported flooding inside homes and other issues.\n\nSome incidents as of 9 p.m. included:\n\nA vehicle stuck in mud on southbound Highway 101 near Seacliff, with traffic slow along the corridor.\n\nRocks, a tree and power lines blocking lanes of Highway 150 west of Lake Casitas, between the lake and Carpinteria.\n\nA vehicle in floodwater on Highway 150 near Santa Ana Road, as Coyote Creek waters rose. A man was reportedly rescued from the vehicle.\n\nFallen trees and other issues were also reported on local streets and neighborhoods.\n\nWeak tornado watch issued for Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme\n\nAn alert of a weak tornado has been issued for Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme until 9 p.m., the National Weather Service said.\n\nA weak tornado, also known as a waterspout, could cause minor damage with spinning winds of up to 50 to 60 mph, said Joe Sirard, meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nMore Ventura County areas added to flood watch list\n\nMore Ventura County areas were added to the flood watch list, which is set to expire at 10 p.m., according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nAreas include:\n\nVentura and Ventura Harbor\n\nOxnard\n\nCamarillo\n\nPort Hueneme\n\nNewbury Park\n\nPoint Mugu\n\nPoint Mugu State Park\n\nWestlake Village\n\nAgoura Hills\n\nMinor flooding is ongoing or expected in these areas, according to the weather service. Minor flooding is possible along creeks and small streams, including Conejo Creek downstream of Highway 101 near Camarillo.\n\nThe rain will likely trigger shallow mud and debris flows, minor rock falls, and flooding capable of local damage, especially in steep terrain in and near burn scars, according to the weather service.\n\nLatest rain and snow totals\n\nFrazier Park has seen 13 inches of snow pile up over the last three days, 5 inches of which fell between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Friday, according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nNo updates were given for:\n\nMount Pinos: 12 inches\n\nMountain High: 16 inches\n\nPine Mountain Club: 6 inches\n\nLockwood Valley: 10 inches\n\nIn a tweet, the weather service said it expected snow to return to lower elevations after 10 p.m. Friday and warned drivers to avoid the recently-opened Tejon Pass.\n\nHere are preliminary rainfall totals over the last three days from the National Weather Service as of 4 p.m. Friday. The totals may be misrepresented because of snowfall, according to the weather service.\n\nAgoura Hills: 3.03 inches\n\nAnacapa Island: .99 of an inch\n\nCamarillo: 1.03 inches\n\nCSU Channel Islands 1.65 inches\n\nFillmore: 1.77 inches\n\nLa Conchita: 1.06 inches\n\nMoorpark: 1.33 inches\n\nNewbury Park: 2.18 inches\n\nOjai: 1.89 inches\n\nOxnard (National Weather Service location): 1.45 inches\n\nPiru: 1.57 inches\n\nPort Hueneme: .44 of an inch\n\nRocky Peak: 2.24 inches\n\nSanta Paula: 1.88 inches\n\nSaticoy: 1.61 inches\n\nSimi Valley: .88 of an inch\n\nThousand Oaks: 2.40 inches\n\nVentura: 1.20 inches\n\nWestlake Village 2.44 inches\n\nCHP escorting traffic on Grapevine\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol units from the Fort Tejon and Newhall areas are escorting vehicles through the Grapevine in both directions.\n\nThe Grapevine has reopened but one lane in each direction is closed, said Caltrans spokeswoman Allison Colburn.\n\nRoad conditions on the Tejon Pass on Interstate 5 will remain very wet through the night, according to the CHP Fort Tejon Twitter account, and motorists are advised to not pass the CHP officers conducting the escorts.\n\nCrews are continuing the monitor the roadway for changing weather and conditions and motorists are asked to drive cautiously, according to the Caltrans District 7 Twitter account.\n\nHighway 166 between Highway 101 in Santa Maria and Highway 33 near Taft remains closed.\n\n'In like a lamb'\n\nFebruary came in like a lamb after January storms drenched Ventura County and much of the state.\n\nBut it's going out like a lion, climatologist William Patzert said of Friday’s storm.\n\nIn much of Ventura County, average February rainfall is under 4 inches.\n\n“I expect us to smash that here in the next couple of days and early next week,” said Patzert, formerly at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.\n\nAfter a little break on Sunday, the rain is expected to return Monday and Tuesday.\n\nCaltrans closes part of Highway 166 after mudslides, flooding\n\nState authorities closed Highway 166 between Highway 101 in Santa Maria and Highway 33 near Taft around noon Friday, according to California Highway Patrol records.\n\nThe closure locked down 65 miles of the road that connects Highway 101 to Interstate 5 after flooding and mudslides covered parts of the road, said Alexa Bertola, a spokeswoman for California Department of Transportation District 5.\n\nBertola said the department had no estimate for when the highway would reopen.\n\nWith the Grapevine closed over Tejon Pass on Interstate 5, Highway 166 typically provides a detour for northbound motorists from Ventura, Santa Barbara and LA counties as a connection between the 101 and the 5. Southbound motorists on the 5 likewise use the 166 as a detour.\n\nClosure of both freeways can sometimes snarl roads in the region if drivers get backed up for extended periods.\n\nFlash flood warning issued for parts of Ventura County\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning to parts of Ventura County including Ojai, Fillmore and Simi Valley through 10 p.m. Friday.\n\nHeavy rain will likely continue through much of Friday with additional rainfall of 2 to 5 inches possible, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service.\n\nTow truck drivers roaming until 7 p.m.\n\nThe Ventura County Transportation Commission's freeway service patrol will navigate highways 101 and 118 without a break in service Friday because of the storm.\n\nTow truck drivers are roaming certain segments of the highways looking for stranded motorists until 7 p.m., according to a VCTC Tweet.\n\nTow truck drivers will change flat tires, provide a gallon of fuel and tow vehicles to a safe location off the freeway where motorists can arrange for additional assistance, according to the VCTC website.\n\nAuthorities warn of possible tornado\n\nOn Friday morning, authorities warned of a possible tornado in northern Santa Barbara County.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it had no confirmation that a tornado had formed. But its radar readings showed a supercell thunderstorm off the coast had moved to shore, prompting the warning.\n\nOnce it moved ashore, it dissipated quickly, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nHeavy rain still to come\n\nAround 1 p.m. Friday, heavy rain was falling around Ojai and farther north. But elsewhere in Ventura County, many areas had lighter or more moderate rainfall.\n\nThat's because some of the heaviest rain had stalled over Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, said Ryan Kittell, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. The band over Santa Barbara is expected to move in Ventura County later Friday afternoon or evening, he said.\n\nWhen that happens, the county will experience the brunt of the \"very cold\" storm. By Friday evening, periods of intense rain could reach half an inch to an inch an hour.\n\n\"We do expect quite a bit of flooding over the roads developing, if not earlier, certainly by tonight,\" Kittell said.\n\nLockwood Valley roads close\n\nClose to 2 feet of snow had piled up in Lockwood Valley by noon Friday and even more blanketed the nearby mountains.\n\nGusty winds came in waves throughout the day and the snow continued to fall, said Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Vulich at a station off Lockwood Valley Road in the Los Padres National Forest.\n\n“Pretty much every road is closed,” he said. “The road crews are working on Lockwood Valley Road between Frazier Mountain and Chico Larson Road.\"\n\nVulich said he had not had any reports of significant damage. The road closure had kept people safe and off the roads for now. But he expected to see a lot of folks come up on Sunday to check out the snow after the storm had passed.\n\nSnow blankets Mount Pinos\n\nThe National Weather Service reported three-day snowfall totals as of 11 a.m. Friday for these Ventura County spots.\n\nMount Pinos: 12 inches\n\nMountain High: 16 inches\n\nPine Mountain Club: 6 inches\n\nLockwood Valley: 10 inches\n\nFrazier Park: 8 inches\n\nSee the storm sweeping through county\n\nCounty reports rainfall totals\n\nHere are rainfall totals from the last 24 hours as of 9 a.m. Friday. The preliminary figures were reported by the Ventura County Watershed Protection District.\n\nCamarillo: .71 of an inch\n\nFillmore: .9 of an inch\n\nMatilija Canyon: 2.94 inches\n\nMoorpark: .83 of an inch\n\nOjai: 1.62 inches\n\nOxnard: .91 of an inch\n\nPort Hueneme: .44 of an inch\n\nSanta Paula: 1.06 inches\n\nSimi Valley: .88 of an inch\n\nThousand Oaks: .66 of an inch\n\nVentura: .76 of an inch\n\nA snow-covered Grapevine\n\nSnow blanketed the Grapevine on Friday morning. The interstate remained closed with no estimated time for reopening, according to a tweet from the California Highway Patrol.\n\nCaltrans is working hard on clearing the snow and ice from the roadway, the CHP said.\n\nCrews patrolling hot spots\n\nSnowfall at lower elevations reduced the amount of rainfall early on in the multi-day storm. But as the snow shifts to higher elevations, more rain could cause problems on local roads.\n\n“We’re just watching hour by hour,” Dave Fleisch, the county's assistant public works director, said Friday morning.\n\nThe agency had trucks patrolling throughout the county, particularly in areas that typically flood and those damaged in January storms, he said. The hot spots include Matilija Canyon north of Ojai as well as Camp Chaffee and Nye roads in the Ojai Valley.\n\nState Highway 33 and Matilija Canyon Road took some of the biggest hits last month. Parts of the roads washed out, and others were buried in mud and rocks.\n\nAuthorities report no major issues\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Office of Emergency Services reported no major storm-related problems by 9 a.m. Friday.\n\nBut it is early, OES Director Patrick Maynard said. The storm appears to be shaping up to dump much of the heavier rain on the county Friday afternoon, likely between 3 and 7 p.m., Maynard said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, much of the county recorded below an inch of rainfall. Matilija Canyon above Ojai received just over 3 inches of rain and spots along the Highway 33 corridor ranged from 1 1/2 and 2 inches.\n\nIntense downpours to hit Ventura County\n\nIntense downpours and isolated thunderstorms were shifting toward southern Ventura County and southeast Santa Barbara around 8:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nVery heavy rain, road flooding, small hail and gusty winds were possible, the National Weather Service said. The agency also cautioned that ocean waterspouts and land-based tornadoes were possible through noon Friday.\n\nPea-sized hail, waterspouts possible\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a special marine warning for winds potentially greater than 50 knots and steep waves in waters off Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\nThe warning, issued shortly after 8 a.m. Friday, covers the water from Point Sal to Santa Cruz Island, including San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands, and from Point Mugu to San Mateo Point, including Catalina and Anacapa islands.\n\nPea-sized hail and waterspouts are possible, the agency said. The warning remains in effect until 10:15 a.m.\n\n'Very disruptive' storm\n\nClimatologist William Patzert described the storm as “very strong” and “very cold.”\n\nThe system came out of northern Canada, dropping down the coast of California. Typically, storms lose intensity as they move south. But this one is maintaining its horsepower, said Patzert, formerly at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.\n\nHe called Friday the “big show” for Southern California. Some areas could get 4 to 8 inches of rainfall, and spots in the mountains may see blizzard conditions.\n\n“This is going to be a very disruptive and potentially dangerous system,” he said.\n\nSnow on I-5\n\nAuthorities reported about 8 to 10 inches of snow through the Tejon Pass Friday morning. Interstate 5 is closed in the area from Grapevine Road to Parker Road, Caltrans said in a tweet.\n\nPopular preserve closes\n\nThe Ventura Land Trust closed the popular Harmon Canyon Preserve as of Friday morning.\n\nThe popular hiking area in the Ventura hillsides closed for several weeks earlier this year after getting pummeled in January storms. The downpours washed out roads, mud slid down hills and several sinkholes opened up, one an estimated 30-feet deep.\n\nThis closure should not last as long, according to the trust. The preserve generally closes one day for every quarter-inch of rainfall to allow for trail maintenance and the soil to dry out. Periodic rain is expected in the area through Wednesday.\n\nBlizzard, wind, flood warnings in effect\n\nAs the storm intensifies, the National Weather Service issued warned of potentially hazardous conditions in Ventura County. Here is the list as of 4 a.m. Friday.\n\nBlizzard Warning: Ventura County mountains. Expires 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHigh Surf Advisory: Ventura County beaches. Expires 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nWind Advisory: Ventura County’s central and southeastern valleys, beaches, inland coast, Lake Casitas, Ojai Valley, Santa Monica Mountains. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Ventura County’s central and southeastern valleys and inland coast, Ojai Valley, Lake Casitas. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Santa Monica Mountains. Expires 1 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFlood Watch: Ventura County mountains. Expires 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHeavier rain on the way\n\nAs of 6:30 a.m. Friday, Ventura County was on the edge of the brunt of the storm.\n\nSome heavier rain and snow was hitting areas above Ojai and local mountains. But the heavier activity – downpours, isolated thunderstorms and possibly a waterspout – was slamming the western side of Santa Barbara County, said Eric Boldt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\n\"We're looking at quite a bit of heavy rain throughout the day in Ventura County,\" Boldt said. \"I would say late morning, through the afternoon and into the evening, that's when we're going to be hit hardest here locally.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the low pressure system heading down the California coast will move right over top of Ventura County, he said. That means more unstable conditions, heavy downpours, small hail and some lightning.\n\nSnow closes interstate\n\nThe California Highway Patrol and Caltrans closed I-5 through the Tejon Pass around 4 a.m. Friday because of snow and low visibility. Highway 101 was the only viable alternative route.\n\nRain pushes into Ventura County\n\nAs of 8 p.m. Thursday, shower activity was expanding into western Ventura County, said meteorologist Robbie Munroe with the National Weather Service office in Oxnard.\n\nA warm front had set up offshore that was pushing the rain toward the area, he said. The warm front was more pronounced than anticipated, he said, which could lift some expected snow levels higher than previously forecast, although some snow could still fall as low as 2,000 to 3,000 feet.\n\nRainfall was likely to increase through the night along with a cold front. The heaviest and most widespread precipitation was expected Thursday night through Friday afternoon, Munroe said. Showers that linger through Saturday could also bring thunderstorms.\n\nSnow at higher elevations, especially above 5,000 feet, could reach 2 to 5 feet, creating dangerous conditions. A rare blizzard warning for mountain areas includes possible whiteouts and strong winds. The weight of snow, coupled with wind, could down trees, disrupt power and damage roofs.\n\nAn avalanche expert at the weather service has concerns about steep terrain in mountain areas where snow and wind combine, Munroe said. The greatest threat for an avalanche is typically within 24 hours of a storm.\n\nRecord low tied at LAX\n\nA low of 41 degrees recorded at Los Angeles International Airport Thursday tied the record low for the date set in 2019, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDuring a heavy rain squall around 11 a.m., the temperature fell from 51 to 41 degrees in less than an hour, the agency reported.\n\nNo records were noted for the Camarillo Airport station or the weather service office in Oxnard, the two sites in Ventura County where the agency tracks historical data.\n\nEarly snow impacts passes\n\nSnow fell on Highway 154 in Santa Barbara County Thursday afternoon, closing the route over San Marcos Pass, elevation 2,200 feet, for a time. After dusting the Santa Ynez Valley, the storm moved into the Ojai Valley, bringing bouts of rain and dropping some snow on surrounding mountainsides.\n\nWeather could close Highway 154 intermittently as the brunt of the storm arrives, officials said.\n\nIn Ventura County, Highway 33 remains closed above the Matilija Hot Springs area, as it has been since heavy rainstorms washed away portions of the route in early January.\n\nSome snow fell along the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 Thursday, but as of 6:45 p.m. Thursday, the highway was open.\n\nYou can check on updates for state highways and freeways at the Caltrans road information site.\n\nCounty issues evacuation warnings\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff's Office of Emergency Services on Thursday issued evacuation warnings for several areas hit hard by last month's storms. Repairs and cleanup are still underway, leaving spots more vulnerable.\n\nAn evacuation warning means people should be prepared to leave but the threat is not yet imminent. The warnings take effect at 3 p.m. Thursday through 10 a.m. Saturday unless conditions stabilize:\n\nMatilija Canyon Road in areas north of Fairview Road, including North Fork and Camino Cielo, in Ojai\n\nCreek Road near San Antonio Creek and Old Creek Road in Ojai\n\nCamp Chaffee at Casitas Vista Road near Camp Chaffee\n\nVentura Beach RV Park in Ventura (through 6:00 p.m. Friday)\n\nForecast calls for snow, rain\n\nThe brunt of this week's unusually cold storm is expected to sweep through Ventura and Los Angeles counties Friday and Saturday, bringing more snow, heavy rain and gusty winds.\n\nThe forecast called for 2 to 5 inches in the county's coastal and valley areas from Thursday through Saturday. In higher elevations, 2 to 5 feet of snow above 4,000 to 5,000 feet and 6 to 12 inches of snow from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.\n\nOn Thursday, some bouts of rain moved through Ventura County, with snow dusting peaks visible from the Ojai Valley and Santa Paula, among other spots.\n\nThis story will be updated.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2021/09/01/ida-path-nj-live-updates-hurricane/5678359001/", "title": "Ida live updates: 25 people dead in New Jersey, many trapped in ...", "text": "The remnants of Hurricane Ida has taken 25 lives across New Jersey, left thousands without power and dozens of streets underwater.

Phil Murphy visited Passaic Thursday evening, as its residents and officials deal with the rubble of Ida and reels from the death of a resident and two who are still missing after being washed away into a culvert by McDonalds Brook.\n\nThe governor walked side-by-side with Mayor Hector Lora, Council President and Assemblyman Gary Schaer, and Wood-Ridge mayor and state Sen. Paul Sarlo down Benson Avenue, where the two residents went missing.\n\nThe leaders passed piles of mud and rocks where large sections of asphalt were torn from the street by rushing flood waters.\n\n“We got word that all heck broke loose and wanted you to know we’re there for you,” Murphy told Lora, after the mayor thanked him for phoning Wednesday night during the height of the storm.\n\nWhile the death of the 70-year-old man and missing man and woman, both presumed to be about 18 to 19 years old, loomed large over the city’s residents, Lora noted it was quick action from his first responders that saved 200 people who were trapped by rising tides from the Passaic River.\n\n“We fear the worst but hope for the best,” Murphy said of the Passaic’s losses. “It absolutely breaks your heart.”\n\nMurphy said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Thursday and was awaiting word on aid from FEMA, but is still unsure how much aid the federal government will send and how soon.\n\n“We asked [Biden] for high water vehicles, we’re using every one of them in the state,” Murphy said of his conversation with the president, who he described as receptive to the state’s troubles, along with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n\nMurphy said he will be sending a “full-bore disaster declaration” to Washington, which he announced on Twitter soon after, and that he’s optimistic New Jersey will receive the help it needs from the Biden administration.\n\nWhile the state has remaining funds from the CARES Act, meant to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, Murphy thought it was unlikely any of those funds could be appropriated for storm relief, due to strict parameters placed on the support.\n\n“I think we’re more likely to be doing things on our own with FEMA’s help,” he said.\n\nPassaic can “undoubtedly” expect funds from the state to deal with damage from the storm and shore up structures to prevent future disasters, he added.\n\n\"The infrastructure bill in Washington is a potential gamechanger,” Murphy said, alluding to a $1 trillion spending package under consideration in Congress that would release funds to fix or replace degrading bridges, roads and tunnels across the U.S.\n\nConfirmed deaths\n\nA 70-year-old Clifton man was killed in Passaic after water engulfed the car he was in, officials said.\n\nCity officials also fear that a woman and child who were in the car with the man were swept away by water.\n\nVenezia said the Bloomfield man's death is under investigation. The man was not identified.\n\nIn Elizabeth, five people died in an apartment complex that flooded, and two people were found dead in a submerged vehicle in Hillsborough\n\nMaplewood man dies\n\nPolice confirmed that a Maplewood man died during Wednesday night’s storm that dumped over 8 inches of rain on the township and caused widespread flooding\n\n“It is believed that he may have been attempting to remove debris from drains in the area and was suddenly sweep up into dangerous flood waters,” Maplewood Police Chief Jim DeVaul said in a release.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., police received a call from a Maple Terrace resident who stated her husband had not returned after going out in the storm, DeVaul stated.\n\n“Officers and Fire Rescue Personnel along with neighbors conducted a thorough check of the surrounding area and were unable to locate him due to dark and hazardous flood conditions,” DeVaul said.\n\nThursday morning, around 7:12 a.m., a body was located on Ridgewood Road, he said.\n\nThe man’s identity has not been released.\n\nMissing persons\n\nTragedy struck in Woodland Park when a woman was swept away in flood waters on Lackawanna Avenue near Filippone Way after getting out of her car when it became trapped in the floods, according to acting police Chief John Uzzalino.\n\nTwo bystanders attempted to help the woman before she succumbed to the flood waters that fed into Dowling Brook and, eventually, the Passaic River, Uzzalino said. The two people who attempted to help the woman also became trapped in the currents until first responders rescued them.\n\nUzzalino said police are still searching for the woman, who they identified as Donna Lomagro, 56, of Little Falls as of 3:30 p.m. Thursday. She is 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 120 pounds.\n\nAnyone who sees her is asked to contact Sgt. Leonard Schaefer (973) 345-8117 or at lschaefer@wpnj.us.\n\nFlood warnings continue\n\nHackensack's Office of Emergency Management extended existing flood warnings until 2 a.m. Friday, according to an alert the office issued on Thursday afternoon.\n\nJust before the warning was released, the stage of the Saddle River measured 10.5 feet near Lodi, which is more than 4 feet above its flood stage, the office said.\n\nBut over the previous 24 hours, the river had already risen as high as 12.6 feet.\n\nLevels are expected to drop below the flood stage Thursday evening and continue to recede into Sunday morning.\n\nFairfield's mayor, Jim Gasparini, warned residents that despite the clear skies on Thursday, river levels continued to rise and to remain vigilant for flooding in their homes and avoid driving, if possible.\n\nIf your basement floods, Gasparini said not to attempt to pump out the water until flooding recedes from around your home.\n\nIs Newark Airport open?\n\nTerminals A and C are open but Terminal B was closed Thursday morning after its lower level flooded during last night's storm. However, Terminal B reopened Thursday afternoon. More details here.\n\nRainfall totals in North Jersey\n\nRain battered the area through Wednesday night and into early Thursday morning, with some towns receiving up to 7 inches, more than the 3 to 6 inches that was forecasted.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. Thursday here are some of the area's rain totals by town, provided by Bob Ziff of the North Jersey Weather Observers:\n\nBergenfield: 5.31 inches\n\nElizabeth: 6.67 inches\n\nHigh Point: 4.86 inches\n\nHillsdale: 5.84 inches\n\nLyndhurst: 7.64 inches\n\nNew Brunswick: 6.99 inches\n\nNew Providence: 7.20 inches\n\nParamus: 7.18 inches\n\nParsippany: 5.55 inches\n\nRamsey: 5.66 inches\n\nSomerset 7.62 inches\n\nStewartsville: 7.60 inches\n\nVernon: 4.51 inches\n\nWantage: 4.79 inches\n\nWest Milford: 4.81-8.20 inches depending on elevation.\n\nPower outages in NJ\n\nMore than 26,797 customers in North Jersey remained without power Thursday afternoon.\n\nPower outages:Tens of thousands still without power in North Jersey morning after remnants of Ida\n\nHighways flooded\n\nJust before midnight, there was so much flooding on the highways in North Jersey that the state's traffic advisory website, 511NJ.org, was barely visible behind the sea of storm-related alerts.\n\nGarden State Parkway closed\n\nThe Garden State Parkway in East Orange remained closed and flooded in both directions as of about 10 a.m. at exit 147 per the NJ Department of Transportation.\n\nNewark Airport flights suspended\n\nAt 10:28 p.m., Newark Airport tweeted: \"We're experiencing severe flooding due to tonight’s storm. All flight activity is currently suspended & travelers are strongly advised to contact their airline for the latest flight & service resumption information. Passengers are being diverted from ground-level flooded areas.\"\n\nLimited flight schedules resumed shortly before midnight but the roadways in and out of the airport remained treacherous.\n\nVideos on social media showed heavy flooding on the ground floor at Newark Liberty International Airport. The NWS reports the airport was hit with 3.24 inches of rain between 8 and 9 p.m.\n\nWhen visiting Newark Avenue, Bloomfield mayor Michael Venezia said there were at least 50 cars abandoned and in the middle of the street after people couldn’t drive anymore and that there are a “considerable amount” of cars abandoned throughout town.\n\nWhat's happening on Thursday in North Jersey\n\nAcross North Jersey, towns are attempting to work through damage caused by Ida.\n\nUrma Avenue in Clifton, which is adjacent to section of Garden State Parkway, frequently floods during torrential rains. Wednesday night was no different.\n\n\"My neighbors had two to three feet of water,\" Clifton City Councilman Bill Gibson said.\n\nGarfield lost a few police vehicles and the department of public works was flooded, said Mayor Richard Rigoglioso.\n\nIn North Arlington, the DPW building on Disposal Road took on 4 feet of water, said Borough Administrator Stephen Lo Iacano. He said the building received serious damage including a potential loss of desks and equipment. The water is drained but the building is filled with mud. Lo Iacano also said the firehouse on Legion Place flooded.\n\nHoly Name Medical Center in Teaneck had some flooding near the emergency room and fallen trees led to a few power outages but as of 10 a.m. the Department of Public Works had a storm crew helping with cleanup efforts throughout town.\n\nMillburn Township Administrator Alex McDonald said the town experienced “some devastating flooding” Wednesday night.\n\nThe downtown was completely flooded, severely damaging businesses in the Millburn Avenue and Essex Street areas. The flooding was reminiscent of Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Floyd in 1999, both of which caused major damage to the downtown area.\n\nBloomfield Mayor Michael Venezia said between 70 to 70% of the homes in Bloomfield were flooded during the estimated 10 inches of rain the township got from Ida.\n\nThe mayor said the worst-hit areas were Newark and Glenwood avenues, Lackawanna Place and Charles Street. Watsessing Park near Glenwood Avenue was underwater.\n\n\"It’s just beginning in Pequannock,\" Flood Control Advisory Committee member Nick DeStefano said. \"Basically you have Pequannock Avenue at Roosevelt shutdown and probably within the next four-to-five hours you’re going to see a lot more flooding throughout the township.\"\n\nNJ Transit rail service suspended\n\nNJ Transit announced that all rail service, except the Atlantic City line, has been suspended due to the storm.\n\nService remained suspended at about 10 a.m. NJ Transit also warned of major bus delays. But Newark Light Rail service resumed at about 10 a.m.\n\n\"If you do not have to travel, please don't,\" NJ Transit tweeted.\n\nSchools canceled for Thursday\n\nThe Clifton school district announced by email to parents late Wednesday night that there will be no classes on Thursday – the first scheduled day of school.\n\nThey became one of at least a dozen of local schools that just opened for the new year to close due to the storm.\n\nWashed out:List of schools closings in NJ after major flooding from Tropical Storm Ida\n\n\"Due to extensive flooding in and around the city of Clifton, all schools are closed tomorrow, Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. We are anticipating that schools will reopen on Friday, Sept. 3, 2021, and will keep you apprised of the situation.\"\n\nPassaic declares state of emergency\n\nPassaic Mayor Hector Lora took to Facebook Live from Main Street around 9:15 p.m. to announce that he was declaring a state of emergency.\n\nLora said all businesses should close and people should stay off the streets. He said that city streets were flooded and cars were becoming stranded.\n\nEssex County flooding\n\nNutley and Belleville put out an alert about flooding in the townships and asked motorists to stay off the roadways.\n\nSeton Hall University announced that the campus will be closed on Thursday \"due to excessive rain and flooding.\" However, all essential employees should report to work, the alert stated.\n\nA resident of Briar Hill Road in Montclair, near Eagle Rock Reservation, reports her home was hit by a downed tree, knocking out power lines.\n\nA video posted to Facebook showed a river of water flowing down Mt.

But the Times reported that the program is still in operation in 2017, even if the Pentagon stopped funding it.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: 'Alien Ranch' west of Phoenix can be yours for $5M\n\nIn response to the Times' story, Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official told CNN: \"My personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone.\"\n\nIs it any coincidence that NASA announced, in August, that it was hiring a \"Planetary Protection Officer\"?\n\nMeanwhile, Phoenix has a storied history of UFO sightings.\n\nProject Blue Book\n\nDecades before the \"Phoenix Lights,\" Arizona residents reported seeing V-shaped formations of UFOs hovering over Yuma and Phoenix.\n\nThey reported reflective flying disks, glowing fireballs and swarms of starlike spheres streaming though the Arizona night skies.\n\nThese sightings, and many more, come from a trove of nearly 130,000 pages of declassified records from Project Blue Book, the Air Force's files on UFO sightings and investigations. The records were released online in January 2015 thanks to UFO enthusiast John Greenewald.\n\nMORE:What's the story behind Phoenix's most famous UFO sighting?\n\nFor Project Blue Book, the Air Force compiled 12,618 UFO sightings between 1947 and 1969 — some of which are from Arizona — but decided to discontinue investigations after finding no proof of national security threats or extraterrestrial vehicles.\n\nWhile the Air Force investigations may have stopped, the sightings never have.\n\nArizona ranks No. 7 on a list of the top 10 states with the most UFO sightings, according to the National UFO reporting center.\n\nThe more than 3,000 sightings in Arizona date back to 1950, the latest of which occurred Jan. 13, when an observer spotted orange lights south of Phoenix near the Estrella Mountains, according to the UFO reporting center's website.\n\nThe Arizona Republic sifted through more than 100 reports from the Project Blue Book files, searching for the interesting, the bizarre and the unbelievable in stories of Arizona's UFO sightings. Many of the names and specific locations within the reports were redacted by the Air Force.\n\nInvestigation of flying discs\n\n4 p.m. July 7, 1947\n\nThe leaves rustled in the wake of a thunderstorm as Mr. Rhodes stepped out his backdoor and walked toward his workshop. From the east, he heard the approach of an incoming jet — possibly a P-80, according to the report.\n\nThe 30-year-old Phoenix man looked, but saw nothing. After several seconds however, a gray disc appeared over the horizon to the northeast.\n\nIt was elliptical in shape, 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and appeared about 5,000 feet in the air. The disc seemed to have a cockpit and a tail.\n\nThe \"object\" spiraled downward to about 2,000 feet, then flew upward into the clouds, traveling at speeds between 400 and 600 miles per hour.\n\nMr. Rhodes ran to his workshop, grabbed his camera and snapped two pictures as the disc dipped under the clouds again, spiraling in a left to right circle, about a quarter- to a half-mile in length.\n\nThe disc then disappeared over the western horizon. The entire event lasted about 60 seconds.\n\nWhile in view, the disc produced no audible sound.\n\nUnidentified sausage-like object\n\n5:45 p.m. April 28, 1949\n\nA Tucson florist stood with two friends at the corner of Campbell Avenue and Hedrick Drive, when an object appeared over the rim of the Catalina Mountains.\n\nThe setting sun reflected off the object's brilliant silver coloration.\n\n\"It appeared sausage like in shape,\" the florist noted in his firsthand account. It had no wings, windows, fins or visible openings, facts corroborated by all three men.\n\nThe sausage seemed to revolve in a slow roll, similar to an airplane (or maybe a hot dog cooking at Circle K) as it sped across the sky at speeds estimated about 500 miles per hour, and at a height of about 5 to 10 miles above the Earth.\n\nThe florist estimated the object would be the size of a city block had it been right in front of him.\n\nThe sighting lasted for about 12 minutes.\n\n\"The only way I can describe it is that it was sausage-like in shape. I am sure that this was not a conventional aircraft and to the best of my knowledge and belief, I can give no reasonable explanation as to exactly what this object was that I saw,\" he said.\n\nAir Force sergeant sees unknown flying objects\n\n2:30 p.m. May 9, 1949\n\nA U.S. Air Force sergeant spotted two flying objects while reclining on the front lawn of his home in northeast Tucson.\n\nThe objects were flat, silver, reflective and \"perfectly round.\" They appeared in the southwest of the sky, about the size of washtubs, approximately 10,000 feet in the air. The pair headed northwest, banked to the left, then abruptly to the right, fading from view over the Catalina Mountains.\n\nThey had no vapor trail, no exhaust and made \"absolutely no sound.\" The objects appeared to be traveling between 750 and 1,000 miles per hours.\n\nThe sergeant wrote that although he had been associated with aircraft his entire life, and spent the last eight years working directly with aircraft, he had never seen anything that moved as fast as the objects he spotted in the Tucson sky.\n\nPilots chase after UFO from ground and sky\n\n7:45 a.m. April 3, 1952\n\nA civilian pilot instructor landed at Marana Air Base.\n\nWhile waiting for a radio transmission from one of his students, the instructor noticed an object described as a \"bright star\" in the morning sky. At first, he thought nothing of it.\n\nAfter about six or seven minutes, a colleague mentioned the object was still hovering in the same place.\n\nAnother man, Mr. Logan, took off from the base to get a better look at the object. He climbed to 13,500 feet, but the object appeared at least 30,000 to 40,000 feet in the air.\n\nWith no hope of matching that altitude without oxygen, Logan landed again at the airport.\n\nAt the same time on the ground, the pilot instructor continued to keep his eye on the object. \"It never moved the slightest fraction in relation to the canopy of my aircraft,\" he said in the report.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of observation, the object suddenly vanished.\n\n\"The object was bright and shone like polished aluminum. I've been flying for 25 years and never saw anything like it. It was weird,\" Logan said in a news article about the incident.\n\nMilitary research indicates there were no balloons in the vicinity of the air base at that time.\n\nOrange light over Cottonwood\n\n7:15 p.m. Jan. 27, 1953\n\nA Cottonwood man stood outside his home watching an airplane fly overhead.\n\nHe followed the plane's blinking lights as they disappeared in the east.\n\nThat's when he noticed the illuminated object.\n\nIt appeared as a yellow-orange light, larger and brighter than any of the stars in the night sky.\n\nThe man ran inside, grabbed a pair of binoculars and returned to see the light heading south.\n\nThrough the binoculars, he could see the object was made of two lights, one brighter light near the head of the object, and a second fainter light near what he assumed was the tail.\n\n\"It moved too fast for a blimp and emitted too much light for a jet,\" he said in his letter. The lights never blinked, and he never heard a noise.\n\nThe man followed the object for about five minutes before it faded into the night.\n\nAir Force conclusion: probably an aircraft. (Previous to this report, the Air Force did not include conclusions about the possible origins of the sightings.)\n\nAir Force pilot over Nogales spot unidentified aircraft\n\nDec. 23, 1954\n\nKenneth Hite was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force stationed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. Hite was flying a local combat air patrol mission when he encountered an unidentified object near Nogales.\n\nHite spotted the object from his eleven o' clock while looking out the window of his F-86d Sabre. He was flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet, and noted the object was about 5,000 to 10,000 feet above him.\n\nThe object flashed with a red and green hazy glow.\n\nHite made contact and radio lock allowing him to automatically follow the selected target, which appeared about 10 miles ahead of him, he said.\n\nNot more than five seconds later, the radio lock broke and Hite was never able to get it back. He continued pursuit at an altitude of 28,000 feet and a speed of 350 knots.\n\nThe distant object appeared to parallel Hite's flight path, maintaining an altitude 5,000 to 10,000 feet above him. The object flew over Nogales and then headed toward Douglas. After reaching Douglas, it turned south and Hite, again, gave chase.\n\nNot long after, Hike began to run low on fuel and had to return to base.\n\nAir Force conclusion: \"The possibility, however remote, of ferret or snooper flights of potentially unfriendly aircraft from areas south of the border should not be discounted completely,\" wrote Capt. Charles L. Dewees about the incident.\n\n\"V\" shaped lights over Yuma\n\nOct. 17, 1955\n\nReports from a missing case file indicate that approximately 12 pale, yellow lights appeared over Yuma.\n\nThe observer, described as a military source, said the formation of the pale lights was a wide \"V\" at a high altitude. The lights grew dimmer, smaller and faded away over the course of about three to four seconds.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The duration and height of the sightings led military officials to believe the observer saw a meteor shower.\n\nAstronomers spot light racing across sky outside of Benson\n\n6:27 p.m. Oct. 19, 1958\n\nA group of astronomers set up about nine miles outside of Benson to watch the Russian space satellite, Sputnik 1, and the third-stage rocket that helped it get into orbit.\n\nThe observers never did see the rocket, but instead saw a bright object over the southeastern horizon. It traveled rapidly across the sky then vanished out of view over the north-northwestern horizon after about five minutes.\n\nThe object had a yellowish hue, was brighter than any other star in the sky, but dimmer than Venus.\n\nIt was traveling in the opposite direction of the satellite's projected path, and was much too bright to be airplane lights, the observer wrote in the account.\n\nAir Force conclusion: possibly artificial meteors. Around the same time, the Air Force launched artificial meteors into the upper atmosphere that glowed bright enough to be photographed.\n\nCigar-shaped object seen over Mesa\n\n7:45 p.m. April 8, 1958\n\nTwo men in their 20s saw an unidentified flying object speeding from north to south while driving west on Main Street in Mesa.\n\nThe men said the object had windows that emitted an orange light.\n\nAt first, the men said it had the appearance of a falling star with an approximate size of a grapefruit held at arm's length.\n\nWhat was peculiar, according to the report, was the object's movement and speed. The light rapidly descended to about 1,500 feet over the city of Mesa then slowly pulled into a steep climb until it performed a near vertical ascent, all the while accelerating.\n\nThe object disappeared from view after a total of 10 seconds.\n\nBoth men were completely convinced they saw a \"flying saucer,\" according to the report.\n\nAir Force conclusion: It may have been a military aircraft on a classified mission, according to a report.\n\nWhite streak over Tucson\n\n6:20 p.m. Feb. 24, 1960\n\nThe sun had just set behind the mountains when a 31-year-old Tucson man and his wife encountered a white, globular light while driving outside of downtown.\n\nThe man's wife pointed at a white streak in the sky, framed by the car's windshield.\n\nAt first the man thought it might be a contrail, but it did not lengthen or spread.\n\nHe pulled to the side of the road to more closely examine the object.\n\nIt appeared as a band of white light, the same color as the contrail.\n\nThe object appeared over the mountains to the west, heading east over the city. As it flew, the object made drastic maneuvers, changing direction and slanting.\n\nBehind the object, the man noted a dim globe shape.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, the diagonal streaks broke off the initial band of light, circling the object, then absorbed back into the original band.\n\nIt appeared to glide over the sky, gently rising and then fading away to the south.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The Air Technical Intelligence Center wrote a letter stating that the object was determined to be the re-entry of U.S. satellite Discover VIII.\n\n15 reports of UFOs over Phoenix\n\n4:30 a.m. Aug. 10, 1964\n\nAn object with a trail of whitish-yellow flames and sparks skittered across the early-morning sky over Phoenix, according to reports from civilian and military observers.\n\nTwo of the reports indicated the object looked like a fireball and could have been a meteor.\n\nMost agree, the source was very bright and came from a single object. No sound was reported.\n\nMost on the ground observed the object heading from west to east, but two flight crews reported the object moving southwest to northwest.\n\nOn average, the object was visible for about 10 seconds.\n\nAir Force conclusion: Most likely a meteor, according to the report.\n\n6 lights with high-pitched hum over Tempe\n\nSept. 7, 1965\n\nA Tempe liquor-store clerk watched as six whitish-yellow objects flew low over the city as if they were going to land, before disappearing to the southeast over the mountains.\n\nEach of the objects were oval-shaped, and had windows that emanated a pinkish light, according to the clerk. Two of the lights were side by side, and four together.\n\nThey emitted a high-pitched hum that hurt the ears of the observer, and gave her a headache.\n\nThe officer producing the report noted that the clerk was convinced UFOs exist and had seen numerous UFOs during the four years prior. The clerk also said she had hypersensitive hearing that allows her to hear UFOs before she sees them.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The clerk lived under a very active airway, and could have seen eastbound aircraft that went out of sight over the mountains, according to the officer producing the report.\n\nMilitary official spots bright objects with erratic movements\n\nOct. 25, 1965\n\nNine miles southeast of Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, a military official watched the night sky from home.\n\nThe observer noticed a bright object to the southwest.\n\nAt first, the observer thought it resembled a star or planet. It oscillated from white to orange and black to white.\n\nBut then it began to move. It changed directions from south to north, then moved to the southeast and east. It changed elevation, disappeared, then reappeared an hour after its first appearance.\n\nThe observer described the movements as \"erratic\" and emphasized it moved at high speed.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The intelligence officer submitting the report concluded the observer saw the planet Venus in the southwest and Jupiter in the south-southeast.\n\nV-shaped UFO formations over Phoenix\n\n8:05 p.m. Nov. 26, 1965\n\nA husband, wife and son standing outside watched an explosion in the sky similar to Fourth of July fireworks, except that the rocket burst into a perfect circle of blue starlike objects.\n\nThe cluster of 30 to 50 objects then moved south over Phoenix.\n\nTen to 15 seconds after the first sighting, the cluster began \"swarming like bees, resolving into two undulating 'V' formations,\" then melding back into a single V before disappearing while heading due south, according to a summary of the event from the husband, who included his qualifications as an astronomer and a teacher of aircraft identification during World War II.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The officer submitting the report wrote \"Other (BIRDS)\" in the conclusion box on the record.\n\nAn elaborate hoax in Tucson\n\n5:40 p.m. Oct. 9, 1967\n\nA 13-year-old boy said he watched a UFO take off from the desert. He described the object as looking like a large, silver water heater with 2 legs, each fitted with a curved pad.\n\nThe boy said the UFO made a humming sound as it took off, and left an indescribable taste in his mouth.\n\nThe report includes pictures of impressions in the sand the boy alleges were created by the UFO.\n\nThe Aerial Phenomena Branch received the report, took pictures and soil samples, then sent them to the Ohio River Division Laboratory for testing.\n\nIn turn, the lab found that the UFO could not possibly have been the size or dimensions described by the boy.\n\nAir Force conclusion: The last page of a comprehensive 60-page report written by Air Force Col.

André Carson of Indiana, the chairman of the panel holding the hearing, warned in his opening remarks, “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena are a potential national security threat. And they need to be treated that way.”\n\nHe went on to say, “For too long, the stigma associated with UAPs has gotten in the way of good intelligence analysis. Pilots avoided reporting, or were laughed at when they did. DOD officials relegated the issue to the back room, or swept it under the rug entirely, fearful of a skeptical national security community.”\n\n“Today, we know better. UAPs are unexplained, it’s true. But they are real. They need to be investigated. And any threats they pose need to be mitigated,” he said.\n\nThe hearing featured testimony from top government officials and the display of images and video of unidentified aerial phenomena. The public portion of the event lasted fewer than 90 minutes. Following the conclusion of the public hearing, the panel will hold a closed-door, classified briefing Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDuring his testimony, Ronald Moultrie, undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security, argued there is a need to balance transparency with the protection of sensitive intelligence information, saying there is an “obligation to protect sensitive sources and methods.”\n\n“Our goal is to strike that delicate balance, one that enables us to maintain the public’s trust while preserving those capabilities that are vital to the support of our service personnel,” he said.\n\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie, right, and Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray speak with a UAP on a screen. Alex Brandon/AP\n\n‘It takes considerable effort to understand what we’re seeing’\n\nScott Bray, deputy director of naval intelligence, also appeared before the panel to answer questions from lawmakers.\n\nDuring his testimony, Bray showed video and images to demonstrate what observations of UAPs may look like – and the effort it takes to try to identify what they might be.\n\nOne video featured images of flashing triangle shapes as seen through night-vision goggles. “In this video, US navy personnel recorded what appears to be triangles – some flashing – recorded several years ago off the coast of the United States,” he said.\n\nHe went on to show an image of what appeared to be another triangle-shaped object that he said came from “several years later and off a different coast.”\n\n“This time other US navy assets also observed unmanned aerial systems nearby and were now reasonably confident that these triangles correlate to unmanned aerial systems in the area,” he said.\n\n“I don’t mean to suggest that everything that we observe is identifiable,” he said, “but this is a great example of how it takes considerable effort to understand what we’re seeing in the examples that we are able to collect.”\n\nThe first video Bray displayed featured only a very short clip of what appeared to be a blue sky with some white markings visible in the distance. He said that showed “an observation in real time” and suggested that it demonstrated how there is frequently a limited amount of data to work off of.\n\nBray echoed the concern that government officials must balance public disclosure with the need to safeguard certain information.\n\n“Given the nature of our business, national defense, we’ve had to sometimes be less forthcoming with information in open forums than many would hope,” he said. “If UAPs do indeed represent a potential threat to our security, then the capabilities, systems, processes and sources we use to observe, record, study and analyze these phenomena need to be classified at appropriate levels.”\n\n“We do not want potential adversaries to know exactly what we’re able to see or understand or how we come to the conclusions we make,” he said.\n\nDefense Undersecretary for Intelligence and Security Ronald S. Moultrie and Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott W. Bray, testify on Tuesday. Jose Luis Magana/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘The intelligence community has a serious duty to our taxpayers’\n\nThere was bipartisan consensus that UFOs should be treated with seriousness and not simply dismissed as something in the realm of science fiction.\n\nThe panel’s top ranking Republican, Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, said in his opening remarks, “aside from all the hype and speculation, there are important underlying issues posed by UAPs.”\n\n“The intelligence community has a serious duty to our taxpayers to prevent potential adversaries such as China and Russia from surprising us with unforeseen new technologies,” he said. “This committee has an obligation to understand what you are doing to determine whether any UAPs are new technologies or not – and if they are, where are they coming from?”\n\nThe hearing was convened by the House Intelligence Committee’s Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation subcommittee.\n\nIt follows the release last year by the US intelligence community of a long-awaited report on mysterious flying objects that have been seen moving through restricted military airspace over the last several decades.\n\nThe report examined 144 reports of what the government terms “unidentified aerial phenomenon” – only one of which investigators were able to explain by the end of the study. Investigators found no evidence that the sightings represented either extraterrestrial life or a major technological advancement by a foreign adversary like Russia or China, but acknowledge that is a possible explanation.\n\nThe House Intelligence Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee holds their hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the Capitol on Tuesday. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nIn his testimony before the panel, Moultrie explained that UAP can refer to “airborne objects that when encountered cannot be immediately identified.”\n\nIn November 2021, the Department of Defense announced the creation of the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group.\n\nThe department said in a release at the time that the purpose of the new program would be to sync up efforts across the US government to “detect, identify and attribute objects of interest” in restricted airspace “to assess and mitigate any associated threats to safety of flight and national security.”\n\nLawmakers requested an update on the program during the hearing. “Today we will bring that organization out of the shadows,” Carson said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.", "authors": ["Clare Foran"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/us/border-migrants-cell-phones-cec/index.html", "title": "The US is loaning cell phones to migrants released from custody ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe sudden chirping of a cell phone sent Joel bolting out of his seat.\n\nHe rushed to a purple backpack sitting behind him and opened the front pocket.\n\nAn alarm was sounding on the phone US immigration authorities had given him, and he knew he had to act fast.\n\nHe fumbled with the phone for several minutes, struggling to understand the app’s English-language instructions and follow its rules for snapping a selfie.\n\n“Are they going to send me back to Cuba?” he asked, worried he’d be returned to the country he says he fled after facing police persecution.\n\nJoel, who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his safety, was among several migrants who spoke with CNN recently in San Antonio, Texas. He’s one of a growing number of Cubans crossing the US-Mexico border and seeking asylum in the United States. And the government-issued cell phone he carried shows he’s also part of another growing group.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is monitoring nearly a quarter of a million migrants in a program using GPS ankle monitors, phones or an app known as SmartLINK, according to the agency’s latest statistics. The Biden administration has rapidly grown the number of people in this program, known as “alternatives to detention,” or ATD.\n\nIt’s not clear how many migrants have been loaned phones as part of the program. ICE hasn’t released that data in its regular public updates about the program, and the agency didn’t respond to CNN’s requests for those statistics. But lawyers and advocates who work with migrants told CNN the government-issued phones – which can only be used with the SmartLINK app and can’t make calls or access the internet – are becoming increasingly common.\n\n“We’ve seen a drastic, drastic increase in the use of this technology,” says Javier Hidalgo, an attorney at the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).\n\n“This is an expansion of how DHS is defining detention,” he says, “and there’s a whole host of issues that come with it.”\n\nOfficials argue these forms of monitoring are an effective way to manage cases. But critics on both sides of the immigration debate say the ATD program raises big questions that should concern every American.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, has defended and praised it. Alternatives to detention were mentioned as part of the government’s plan for lifting Title 42, and DHS is asking Congress for millions of dollars to grow the program even more.\n\nThe program enrolled about 1,000 people a day\n\nAlternatives to detention aren’t new; ICE’s program officially began in 2004 and officials began using the SmartLINK app in 2018. The agency relies on BI Inc., a subsidiary of private prison company GEO Group, to run it.\n\nNow the program is expanding – and fast. It’s more than doubled in size since President Biden took office, according to an analysis of government data by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.\n\n“It continues to show just a massive amount of growth,” says Austin Kocher, a researcher at TRAC.\n\nAnd all that growth, Kocher says, can be attributed to the increasing use of SmartLINK, an app that requires users to send photos of themselves as a form of checking in with authorities.\n\nCurrently more than 185,000 people are being monitored by SmartLINK – about three-quarters of those enrolled in the ATD program, ICE says.\n\nThat’s a steep increase from less than three years ago, according to Kocher’s analysis, when SmartLINK monitored less than 6,000 people for ICE.\n\nIn April and May, Kocher says, about 1,000 people a day were being enrolled in the program.\n\nHow the cell phones work\n\nICE says using SmartLINK and other alternatives to detention “effectively increases court appearance rates (and) compliance with release conditions.” Officers determine what level of supervision is required and what technology will be used on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhen migrants like Joel who are selected for the program are released from custody, ICE says some are loaned devices loaded with SmartLINK installed, unless they have their own smartphones.\n\nThe government-issued phones cannot make calls or be used to access the internet, ICE says, beyond using the app for its intended purpose. Migrants who have their own devices are asked to download the app onto their phones.\n\nSmartLINK “uses facial recognition software to verify identity, GPS data point capture, push notifications and reminders, direct messaging with case officers and participants, and a searchable services database,” according to ICE.\n\n“Those who do not report,” ICE says, “are subject to arrest and potential removal.”\n\nJoel told CNN he’s currently required to send in a photo to check in weekly. The first time he tried to submit a photo, he received multiple errors, and – at one point – an ominous warning: “two attempts remaining.” After four tries, his photo was accepted and he received a notification that the check-in was complete.\n\n“It scared me,” he said. “I can’t go back to Cuba.”\n\nJoel attempts to use a government-issued phone to check in with ICE during an interview with CNN's Rosa Flores. CNN obscured part of this image to protect the subject's safety. CNN\n\nHidalgo, who regularly works with asylum-seeking migrants, says many clients have recently reported receiving phones with the SmartLINK app installed.\n\nBut the phones, he says, are raising many concerns. Some migrants, he says, have reported difficulties with charging and powering on the devices.\n\n“There’s a fear…that folks are going to miss their check-ins just because of the technology issues,” he says.\n\nICE says participants with concerns about monitoring technology can contact case specialists for assistance.\n\nGEO Group declined to comment, referring questions to ICE. BI’s website touts the “hassle-free setup” and increased battery life of its mobile devices.\n\n“Clients can easily comply with supervision terms,” an information sheet on the site says, “without the hassle of app stores and traditional smart phone functionality and updates.”\n\nA section about alternatives to detention on GEO’s website says devices preloaded with SmartLINK aren’t smartphones since they can’t browse the internet, make calls, send or receive texts, or access app stores.\n\nThe company says it’s a myth that the app frequently malfunctions and causes immigrants to miss check-ins. “An average of 88.4% of SmartLINK check-ins were completed successfully over the last five years,” GEO says.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates say privacy is lost and private companies are profiting\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argue that expanding the alternatives to detention program is creating new problems and raising major privacy concerns.\n\nSeveral organizations – Mijente, Just Futures Law and Community Justice Exchange – filed a lawsuit in April asking a judge to order ICE to release more information about how data obtained through SmartLINK is tracked, used and shared. The suit decries “constant, invasive surveillance” and says the program takes a major toll on the immigrants enrolled in it.\n\nThe organizations argue they first asked for the information via a Freedom of Information Act request in September, and that ICE and DHS did not respond.\n\n“We’re now at this new frontier of immigration enforcement, where digital surveillance plays a huge role and the kind of information that ICE is collecting and the net that they’re casting is so large that the system is looking completely different,” says Cinthya Rodriguez, an organizer for Mijente.\n\nSejal Zota, co-founder and legal director of Just Futures Law, says she’s hoping the lawsuit will answer questions about the program and what she and others refer to as ICE’s “digital prisons.”\n\n“It’s very unclear to us what information ICE and BI are collecting on immigrants and how that information is being used or could be used,” she says. “That lack of clarity raises alarms about people’s privacy, future uses of this data and the reach of this surveillance dragnet.”\n\nA government-issued cell phone sits on a table in a park where recently released migrants have been gathering in San Antonio, Texas. CNN\n\nMeanwhile, she says, the program is needlessly causing emotional harm to tens of thousands of people. Some people enrolled in the program, she says, are told their case manager may call them at any point on a given day, making them scared to leave home.\n\n“Imagine an app, it can call you any time, while you’re at work, while you’re cleaning someone’s house. It makes weird sounds. It draws people’s attention,” Zota says.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the agency’s policy against commenting on pending litigation. But in a May 23 court filing, the agency asked a judge to dismiss the case, stating that the organizations’ initial FOIA request did not sufficiently describe the records sought and that some information requested may be exempt from disclosure. Government attorneys also denied the lawsuit’s allegations about the program and its impact.\n\nICE has said it’s “committed to protecting privacy rights, and civil rights and liberties of all participants” in the program, and that a privacy analysis of the program was conducted and approved by DHS.\n\nGEO Group declined to comment, referring questions to ICE. On its website, the company says that it complies with all federal privacy laws, that it does not conduct surveillance and that all data and records collected under its contract with ICE are the property of the US government.\n\nConservative critics say releasing migrants provides the wrong incentive\n\nThe program has also come under fire from conservative critics, who say they’re worried it gives would-be migrants a greater incentive to take their chances at the border.\n\n“When you start handing out cell phones and say, ‘We’ll buzz you when we need to get in touch with you,’ and then they let them go on their merry way into the interior of the United States, that’s just going to encourage more and more people to come,” says Chris Chmielenski, deputy director of NumbersUSA, an organization that advocates for less immigration.\n\nInstead, Chmielenski says, anyone who crosses the border illegally should be immediately kicked out of the country.\n\n“Then you don’t have to deal with detention centers or alternatives to detention,” he says.\n\nDuring a recent hearing over the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed 2023 budget, Rep. Jake LaTurner, R-Kansas, expressed his dismay over plans to grow the ATD program.\n\n“Do you really believe that mass releasing those who illegally cross our borders does not send the wrong message to human smugglers, cartels and migrants?” he said. “Isn’t this yet another message by this administration that the US will not enforce our immigration laws?”\n\n“No, that is not the message at all,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas responded. “The individuals are in immigration enforcement proceedings. And if their claims for relief under the laws of the United States are not successful, they are subject to removal. And the appearance rate of individuals on our alternatives to detention program have, in fact, increased.”\n\nLaTurner was unconvinced.\n\n“This program, without question,” he said, “is another message that the borders are wide open. Come on in.”\n\nSome say money for the program would be better spent elsewhere\n\nThe rapid growth of the program shouldn’t just concern those with ties to the immigration system, says Kocher, who’s also an assistant research professor at Syracuse.\n\n“This technology is expansive,” he says. “And it’s not as if this is going to stop with immigrants either. It could be anyone. It could be having outstanding tickets in your city. It could be students on suspension from school. This technology could be increasingly used by your employer to track what you’re doing at work.”\n\nOpponents of the way US immigration authorities use technology often point out that tools initially deployed as part of immigration enforcement, such as border surveillance, later can end up expanding into other communities and uses.\n\nKocher and other critics of the alternatives to detention program argue the resources used to fund it could be better spent elsewhere. This fiscal year’s budget includes more than $440 million to fund the program. And officials are requesting $87 million more for next year.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argue that providing legal representation to those with cases in immigration court would do even more to guarantee that people keep showing up. Immigration restrictionists argue the resources would be better spent on detaining and deporting more migrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nNeither of those options appears to be imminent. But the push to expand alternatives to detention remains a clear priority.\n\nICE recently renewed a contract with another private company to provide 10,000 cell phones outfitted with a facial recognition app for migrant check-ins.\n\nFor his part, Joel says he plans to keep using the government-issued phone to check in every week.\n\nHe says police persecution and surveillance pushed him to flee Cuba. And in the United States, he says he’s doing everything he can to comply with authorities so he won’t get sent back.\n\nIt’s worth it, he says, for the chance to live in a country where there’s more freedom.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

But how would humans react to the discovery of extraterrestrial life? Panic? Chaos? Reverence?\n\nMore positively than some might expect, according to an Arizona State University study. How humans might react has been the topic of a great deal of speculation in fiction, policy circles and academia, said Michael Varnum, assistant professor of psychology at ASU.\n\nVarnum has been interested in answering the question for years. Before the study, there was not enough information that could lead to reasonable predictions of humans' reactions, he said:\n\n\"But until now, it was all speculation essentially. This set of studies for the first time tackles the question empirically and the resounding conclusion is that we will take the news rather well.\"\n\nVarnum is a lifelong science-fiction fan and a member of the university's Interplanetary Initiative, a pan-university effort aiming to \"pave the way for the future of humans in space,\" according to the center.\n\nThis isn't the first time scientists worked to answer the question.\n\nIn 1953, the United States Air Force coined the term \"UFO,\" or unidentified flying object. That same year, a panel of scientists was formed to study evidence of UFOs and the potential danger they posted to U.S. national security.\n\nScientists believe humanity is much more likely to come into contact with microbial extraterrestrial life before intelligent life.\n\nOverall, the new ASU study focused on just that — humanity's reaction to the discovery of microbial life from other worlds.\n\nThe team performed a pilot study as well as two additional studies. In the additional studies, 500 different participants provided their reactions.\n\n\"If this kind of discovery were to take place, it would be one of the most important scientific events in our history. It also might represent a major paradigm shift in terms of how we see our place in the cosmos,\" Varnum said.\n\nOverall in the studies, people had mostly positive reactions of possible extraterrestrial life.\n\nParticipants looked at past media coverage on events suggesting extraterrestrial life and responded to claims of the discovery of microbial fossils. Articles focused on the possible fossilized Martian microbes, Tabby's Star, the \"Dyson sphere,\" and Earth-like exoplanets.\n\n\"In our second experiment with a general sample, we felt that rather than come up with bogus stories it would be better to present people with actual media coverage of discoveries as a way to increase the realism of the study,\" said Varnum.\n\nAlso, Varnum's team used media coverage on Oumuamua to determine if participants believed the first-known interstellar asteroid was actually a spaceship. The asteroid was discovered in 2017.\n\nVarnum believes the studies are important to scientific research and could lead to change.\n\n\"My work shows that at least in the short term, reactions to this kind of news will be positive, so that rather than worry about the potential for societal chaos, disruption, or negative mental health impacts, instead we can expect that people will be happy to learn we are not alone,\" Varnum said.\n\nMore:UFO encounter?

Here's how they're searching for intelligent life\n\nSightings of UAPs have increased since the early 2000s as the stigma around reporting has decreased, according to Scott Bray, deputy director of naval intelligence. A government database that tracks possible sightings has gained about 400 incidents since last June, when the U.S. Director of National Intelligence made public a report examining UAPs, he said.\n\nThe Navy and the Department of Defense have been working to transition from relying on anecdotes from aviators to a data-driven, \"all hands on deck\" approach to investigating the sightings, Bray said.\n\nBut Bray said it can difficult to identify the objects given that the sightings are often short and may not be recorded. He shared a few short videos and images of unidentified objects to demonstrate how fleeting the observations can be.\n\nOne clip shot through night vision goggles off the U.S. coast several years ago showed glowing green triangles moving through the air. Investigators later determined the mysterious objects were unmanned aerial systems.\n\n\"This is a great example of how it takes considerable effort to understand what we're seeing,\" he said.\n\nMembers of Congress including Rep.

The other three were only partially vaccinated, meaning they received one dose of their MMR or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine when two are needed for a person to be considered fully vaccinated.\n\nExperts recommend that children get the vaccine in two doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age, and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come into contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective.\n\nNationwide, more than 90% of children in the US have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Measles can be very serious, especially for children under age 5,” Columbus Public Health spokesperson Kelli Newman wrote in an email Monday.\n\nAll of the Columbus cases have been in children: 12 in infants younger than 1, 28 in toddlers ages 1 to 2, 14 in children ages 3 to 5, and five in ages 6 to 17.\n\nThat corresponds to about 71% of cases being reported in 1- to 5-year-olds.\n\nWhile the specifics of each hospitalized measles case can vary, “many children are hospitalized for dehydration,” Newman wrote. “Other serious complications also can include pneumonia and neurological conditions such as encephalitis. There’s no way of knowing which children will become so sick they have to be hospitalized. The safest way to protect children from measles is to make sure they are vaccinated with MMR.”\n\nSome of the children visited a grocery store, a church and department stores in a mall while they were contagious, according to Columbus Public Health’s list of exposure sites.\n\nThe outbreak has become so widespread and the virus is so infectious that “it could take a few months before we get this outbreak under control,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nMeasles is a highly infectious disease that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or if someone comes into direct contact with or shares germs by touching contaminated objects or surfaces. The measles virus is so transmissible that, if an infected person coughs or sneezes, it can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours even after the infected person leaves the room.\n\n“Measles can be a severe illness and can commonly lead to complications which require hospitalization, especially in young children,” Dr. Matthew Washam, medical director of epidemiology and infection control at Nationwide Children’s in Columbus, wrote in an email Tuesday.\n\nIn the Ohio outbreak, the hospitalized children have been seen at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.\n\n“Most children can usually recover at home with supportive care and can receive antibiotics for less severe complications, such as ear infections. Some children develop more severe complications, such as dehydration requiring intravenous fluids, pneumonia and/or croup which require respiratory support, or rarely more severe complications such as encephalitis,” Washam wrote.\n\n“The mainstay of treatment for all children with measles is supportive care,” he added. “In the hospital, this can include intravenous fluids, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and respiratory support amongst other supportive care measures. Some children with measles may also be treated with vitamin A given the association of lower vitamin A levels with more severe measles illness.”\n\n‘What’s really driving this is … a lack of vaccination’\n\nThe measles outbreak is “very concerning,” said Dr. Nora Colburn, an adult infectious diseases physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who has been watching the outbreak closely along with her colleagues.\n\n“What’s really driving this is unfortunately a lack of vaccination, which is just heartbreaking,” said Colburn, who also serves as the medical director of clinical epidemiology for the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital at the OSU Wexner Medical Center.\n\n“For measles, it is the most infectious disease we have,” she said. “And so it is very concerning as an infectious disease physician, as also a mother of a young child and as a community member.”\n\nDuring the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while most people stayed home and some health-care facilities were closed, many children missed their routine immunizations, including the MMR vaccine – and they still may not have gotten all their recommended shots. That’s true around the world as well as in the US.\n\n“The concern now is that we’ve had this global dip in vaccination coverage as a result of the pandemic, probably not actually from vaccine hesitancy or refusal but just there were a lot of kids that missed their checkups during the pandemic, and we really haven’t completely caught those kids up,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases and professor of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado.\n\n“Measles is such a contagious disease that when you see those dips, we really worry about the potential for large outbreaks,” he said. “You need to really maintain a high vaccination coverage to keep measles from spreading.”\n\nAbout 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected, according to Columbus Public Health, and about 1 in 5 people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized.\n\nPediatric hospitals already strained\n\nWhile the measles outbreak spreads across central Ohio, the United States has been battling a surge of respiratory illnesses, such as flu and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPediatric hospitals nationwide have been overwhelmed by this rise in respiratory infections and are bracing for the possibility of even more cases over the holiday season.\n\n“I can’t even imagine if your hospital is already chock full and all of a sudden you’ve got to deal with measles, because measles is a really problematic infection-control situation, too. You need negative-pressure rooms, everyone has to wear N95 masks, and it’s incredibly contagious in a hospital,” O’Leary said.\n\n“There’s a lot of risk particularly to immunocompromised patients that are also in children’s hospitals,” he said. “It’s a real problem.”\n\nNationwide Children’s Hospital confirmed to CNN in an email Tuesday that it has seen a surge in other respiratory illnesses, such as flu and RSV, but remains able to keep caring for patients.\n\n“The current surge in respiratory illnesses such as the flu and RSV is being seen locally. While we are experiencing some visits and admissions related to measles, volumes are relatively low compared to flu and RSV. Measles poses a greater strain on resources related to public health efforts, including contact tracing, containment, education, and immunizations,” the hospital statement said. “While busy, our hospital remains able to continue to provide care for patients.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWith each of these respiratory illnesses, it sometimes can be difficult to determine which infection a person has as the symptoms – such as fever, cough, and runny nose – can be similar.\n\n“To have RSV, influenza, Covid at the same time as the holidays, and then now we have measles on top of it, which can have overlapping symptoms of fever and cough and fatigue, it can be really challenging to kind of sort out which infection is what,” Colburn said, adding that it is important for anyone with symptoms to stay home and get tested.\n\nMeasles symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. In rare cases, it may lead to pneumonia, encephalitis or death.\n\n“Wearing your mask, especially in crowded areas, is really important, especially for our immunocompromised patients. I really worry about measles in adult patients who cannot get the MMR vaccines,” she said. “We can’t give it to severely immunocompromised patients or pregnant women. So it’s really important that everybody else gets vaccinated to cocoon those very vulnerable people and decrease the circulation of measles in our community.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/world/ufos-nasa-team-study-scn/index.html", "title": "UFO study by NASA-selected study team kicks off | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOfficials at NASA selected a team of 16 scientists and experts who will delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena — more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The independent study kicked off Monday.\n\nThe group will include experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — as well as retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, a former fighter pilot and test pilot and retired US Navy captain.\n\nAn independent study on unidentifiable objects in the sky by a NASA-selected team started October 24. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe space agency, which first announced it was forming the group in June, previously revealed that the team would be led by astrophysicist David Spergel, who is president of the Simons Foundation in New York City. ​​\n\nThe new group won’t necessarily seek to determine exactly what the UAPs, which have been seen moving through restricted military airspace over the past several decades, are. Rather, the team will look to hash out exactly how it’s best for NASA to approach further study of the phenomenon.\n\nThe space agency has already noted that the limited number of observations of UAPs has made it difficult to draw scientific conclusions about the nature of such events.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nThere have been several studies of UAPs carried out by various arms of the US government, including a Pentagon report that was declassified in June 2021, though none have given the public a clear answer about what the UAPs could be. Officials at NASA have been thinking about how to study UAPs in a formal way for a long time, but they wanted to ensure that they approached it in the right way, said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, in June.\n\nThis study, expected to last about nine months, will also be entirely unclassified and within the public domain.\n\n“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” Zurbuchen said in a Friday statement. “Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”\n\nThe team will gather data on “events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena – from a scientific perspective,” the agency said.\n\nNASA said it was interested in UAPs from a security and safety perspective. There was no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin, NASA added. The study will begin this fall and is expected to take nine months.\n\nThe search for life\n\nNASA has long been tasked with finding life elsewhere, which is why astrobiology programs are part of the agency’s focus, Zurbuchen said. The Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life that may have once existed on Mars while future missions are being developed to seek signs of life on ocean worlds in our solar system. The agency seeks to explore the unknown in air and space, Zurbuchen said.\n\n“We’re looking for the question of whether certain environments are in fact part of, if you want, the ladder of life that got us to where we are,” he said during news conference Thursday.\n\nThe agency will approach the UAP study like they would any other science study – taking a field that is poor in data and making it worthy of scientific investigation and analysis.\n\n“There’s many times where something that looked almost magical turned out to be a new scientific effect,” Zurbuchen said.\n\nGiven the national security and air safety issues that have been raised with UAPs, scientists want to look at the observations and establish if these are natural or need to be explained otherwise.\n\nWhile talking about UAPs in a traditional science environment may be looked down on or regarded as something not related to science, Zurbuchen “vehemently opposes that.”\n\n“I really believe that the quality of science is not only measured by the outputs that come behind it, but also the questions we’re willing to tackle with science,” he said.\n\nThe intent of the study is to make a proposal for a research program that can be implemented once the researchers assess the data that exists and should be reviewed.\n\nThe full report will be made available to the public, and the research team will hold a public meeting to discuss the findings, said Daniel Evans, NASA Science Mission Directorate assistant deputy associate administrator for research, during the news conference. Like NASA’s other standard grant review panels, the budget estimated for this project is between a few tens of thousands of dollars and no more than $100,000, Evans said.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to anticipate what the study will reveal, Spergel said “we should be open to the idea that we’re looking at several different phenomena.”\n\n“I think we have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,” Spergel said. “I’ve spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you, we don’t know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don’t understand. I hope this study moves us forward to understand these phenomena better. But at the end of the day, we may conclude that we still don’t understand many aspects of them and perhaps have a road map on how to make progress.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Katie Hunt", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

The companies’ updated formulations are bivalent vaccines that combine the original vaccines with ones that target Omicron sublineages BA.4 and BA.5, which currently dominates in the United States. Moderna’s shot would be administered as a 50-microgram dose, and Pfizer’s as a 30-microgram dose.\n\nModerna said Tuesday a Phase 2/3 clinical trial on these boosters is now underway. The data it submitted to the FDA comes from experiments in mice as well as data from humans using a different booster which was updated to protect against the BA.1 strain of Omicron.\n\n“We have worked closely with the FDA to ensure that Americans will have access to Moderna’s updated, bivalent booster, which, if authorized, may offer higher, broader, and more durable protection against Covid-19 compared ot the currently authorized booster,” said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna.\n\nNext, the FDA will evaluate the data from Moderna and Pfizer and decide whether to authorize the shots.\n\n“FDA will be using the totality of the available evidence to authorize the fall bivalent boosters,” FDA spokesperson Abigail Capobianco said in a statement emailed to CNN last week. “There are data on many millions of individuals who have received the prototype component as a booster. As for the BA.4/5 component, a combination of nonclinical data obtained in mice, data from prior variant vaccines (including those to beta, delta, and omicron BA.1), along with our extensive knowledge of the safety and efficacy of the mRNA platforms will be used for this decision-making.”\n\nWhen shots could be available\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha has said the updated boosters should be available to the public early- to mid-September, but it is ultimately up to the FDA as to when the shot will get the greenlight.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday that the agency will not convene its independent panel of vaccine experts to seek a recommendation on whether to authorize updated Covid-19 shots.\n\nMarks told the Times the FDA has “extremely good” data that he is “extremely confident” about that shows the shots are safe and will be effective, even though the formulations for the updated boosters have not been tested in humans.\n\nIndependent experts who advise the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations are expected to discuss updated Covid-19 vaccines during meetings next week. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meetings are scheduled for Thursday, September 1, and Friday, September 2.\n\nThe CDC committee typically meets after vaccines have been authorized by the FDA. Shots can be administered only after the CDC recommends them.\n\nProduction of the updated shots is already underway, and states can already order them. The US government has purchased 105 million bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster doses from Pfizer, and another 66 million updated shots from Moderna.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCertain populations are eligible to receive first and second boosters of the existing Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on NBC’s Today on Tuesday that the agency is prepared to take action on updated boosters if the FDA authorizes them, but people already eligible for a booster shot should get one now.\n\n“I would say, there’s never a bad time to go ahead and get your booster if you’re eligible,” Walensky said. “If you’re over the age of 50 and you haven’t gotten that second booster, you can still go ahead and get it now.”", "authors": ["Carma Hassan Brenda Goodman", "Carma Hassan", "Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/health/cdc-advisers-vote-for-boosters-for-kids/index.html", "title": "CDC signs off on boosters for 5-11-year-olds | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on boosters for 5- to 11-year-olds following the independent vaccine advisers recommendation for an additional dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine following a primary series.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisers voted 11-1, with 1 abstention Thursday to support recommending a booster dose, which the US Food and Drug Administration authorized earlier this week.\n\nThe recommendation they voted on was: “A single Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster dose is recommended for persons ages 5-11 years at least 5 months after the primary series, under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization.”\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorsed the booster for children at least five months after they received their two-dose series. This would be a third dose for healthy children and a fourth dose for children who are immunocompromised.\n\nThe committee voted for the booster after hearing details about Pfizer’s application to the FDA to expand access to the boosters for this age group. Waning antibody levels have been seen in children who have received a primary vaccination series, and booster doses achieved antibody levels higher than what was seen after the primary series.\n\nThe company said data from its clinical trials showed it raised Omicron-fighting antibodies by 36 times in this age group. The trial that included 4,500 children ages 5 through 11 saw no new safety issues, according to the company.\n\n“Overall, the benefits of Covid vaccines continue to outweigh the risks as we continue to see, regardless of what age group is highlighted, receipt of the Covid vaccine primary series continues to be critically important for the prevention of severe Covid-19 morbidity and mortality and overall Covid-19 vaccine booster doses have been shown to increase protection against all outcomes in those 12 and over,” said Dr. Sara Oliver, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and the lead for the Covid-19 vaccines ACIP Work Group. “It’s likely that children ages 5 through 11 would benefit from a Covid-19 vaccine booster dose.”\n\nThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been tough on kids. Studies from the New York State Department of Health and the CDC found that the effectiveness of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 fell significantly during the Omicron surge, falling from 68% to about 12% against infection. Two doses of the vaccine did seem to keep kids out of the hospital.\n\nWhile not at the same levels as during the Omicron wave, Covid-19 cases among children have been increasing. The number of new Covid-19 cases among children in the US grew nearly 76% last week from two weeks prior, the American Academy of Pediatrics said Monday.\n\nAccording to the latest report from the CDC, 1,547 children have died of Covid-19 in the US and 364 of them were in the 5-11 year-old age range.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that almost 13.2 million kids in the US have tested positive for Covid-19 during the pandemic, with more than 5.3 million of those cases coming this year. Those numbers are probably undercounted, as testing has fallen off in much of the country.\n\nLooking at electronic health records, with more than 700,000 doses administered, there were no real safety problems found with the Pfizer vaccine in children, according to a presentation given to the committee.\n\nAnaphylaxis rates in children ages 5-11 following the Pfizer vaccination were comparable to the rate seen in people ages 12 and older. In the three months after the initial vaccine series, there were 10 potential cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, both types of heart inflammation, but four of those cases were determined not be related to the vaccination, the CDC said in its presentation.\n\n“The general picture is that myocarditis associated with mRNA vaccination relative to viral myocarditis tends to be clinically mild and patients have good prognosis and a fairly short recovery period,” the CDC’s Dr. Tom Shimabukuro told the committee.\n\nThe rates were also lower in this age group than were seen in adolescence. The rate was also lower after a booster dose.\n\nMost children, if they experienced any problems with the vaccine were considered non-serious, like pain at the injection site. This was similar to adults’ reaction after their second dose.\n\nVaccination is an important protection for children. The risk of dying from Covid-19 for children 12 years and older in February of 2020 was 20 times higher among unvaccinated children, compared to those with the primary vaccine series and a booster dose.\n\nWhile scientists initially believed that Covid-19 didn’t impact children nearly as much as it did adults, deaths from Covid-19 in 5 -11-year-olds were greater than for a number of other pediatric vaccine preventable diseases. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death for children in this age range.\n\n“It’s important to highlight that vaccine coverage for these other conditions, these other diseases, is relatively high, indicating that most parents accept vaccination for Hepatitis A, meningococcal, varicella, rubella and rotavirus even though deaths from these diseases are relatively rare,” said Dr. Matt Daley, who is chair of the COVID 19 vaccines workgroup and a senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research Kaiser Permanente Colorado.\n\nParents should also keep in mind that a child who gets Covid-19 can, like adults, develop long-Covid, Daley said, even after a child has a mild case of Covid-19. Long Covid symptoms can last for years after the initial infection. People who were previously vaccinated were less likely to have symptoms between 12 and 20 weeks after infection compared to those that were unvaccinated, the CDC said.\n\nChildren ages 5 - 11 were also the most vulnerable age group to develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, also known as MIS-C, a rare but serious Covid-19-related condition. Among this age group, there have been 3,800 MIS-C cases and 16 deaths, according to the CDC’s presentation.\n\n“Data do not suggest potential safety concerns regarding a Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster for children five to seven years of age beyond those previously identified in older age groups,” said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot in her safety findings presentation to the committee.\n\nTalbot was the one expert who voted against the booster dose for this age group. While she is in favor of vaccinating children against Covid-19, she thinks public health leaders should concentrate on the low vaccination rate among this age group instead of focusing on boosters.\n\n“I really want children to be vaccinated,” said Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University. “We really need to spend our time and effort on educating the 70% who have not been (vaccinated).

The amended EUA also authorizes second booster doses for certain people 12 and older who are immunocompromised.\n\nFollowing the FDA’s action, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations to allow a second booster dose for those groups – and noted that adults who got a primary shot and booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least four months ago may now get a second booster dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.\n\nThe FDA and the CDC emphasized that they “will continue to evaluate data and information” around the potential use of second booster doses for other age groups.\n\nBut for those who are eligible for a second booster dose, there are plenty of questions about when might be the best time to get vaccinated, where and how.\n\nI’m eligible for a second booster. When should I get the shot?\n\nOlder adults and certain immunocompromised people who are eligible for a second booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine can get it at least four months after their first booster.\n\n“Evidence that we have now from Israel suggests that by getting this, one can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in this population of older individuals, and so we think that this is something that is worthwhile for people to consider,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday.\n\n“If it were my relatives, I’d be sending them out to do this again because of the higher level of protection,” Marks said.\n\nAt age 64, Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is eligible for a second booster dose – but he said he plans to wait to get it.\n\nHe completed his initial two doses of vaccine, had a booster shot and was infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Studies published in February suggest that being vaccinated and having been infected with the coronavirus can offer a type of “durable” protection called hybrid immunity.\n\n“And I don’t have any underlying medical condition, so I feel pretty comfortable waiting,” Moss said. “That could change if we see a huge increase in cases in the United States. But if we don’t, I may be more inclined to wait until the fall and perhaps get my second booster then.\n\n“Now, my parents are 89 and 93 – and I would recommend that they get a booster dose now, because they’re at so much higher risk of severe Covid.”\n\nMoss added that access to Covid-19 antiviral medications that infected people can take at home with a prescription also can play a role in how comfortable someone might feel with waiting to get their second booster dose.\n\n“I think that’s a very important part of the conversation,” Moss said.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the immunity against Covid-19 elicited by the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines can wane over several months, especially among older adults who might have weaker immune systems.\n\nSo the timing of a second booster can make a difference, because the benefit of that vaccination can be “short-lived,” said Dr. Jorge Salinas, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University.\n\n“It’s the same as flu vaccination,” Salinas said. “We get vaccinated once a year, and we open it pretty early. But some people have shown that if you do it too early, you can lose a bit of the protection towards the tail end of the flu season.”\n\nWhere can I get my second booster shot?\n\nThe rollout of additional booster doses is expected to mirror the rollout of initial booster doses, with pharmacies and doctor’s offices among the main sites where people could get their vaccinations.\n\nI’m not eligible for a second booster. How do I know when I can get one?\n\nA second booster shot might be recommended for more Americans as we move into fall.\n\n“It’s possible that people will need to get another vaccine,” Marks said Tuesday, adding that for adults 50 and older, getting a fourth dose now “will not preclude” them from getting an additional dose in the fall “if there’s evidence that another booster could be of benefit.”\n\nIn other words, a second booster dose now does not necessarily mean you wouldn’t be eligible for another boost later this year.\n\n“It may be that some people who get a second booster dose in April or May, they may need and be eligible for another booster dose in the fall, should we suspect a late fall or winter surge as with other respiratory viruses,” Moss said.\n\nIt is “almost inevitable” that most people will need another booster shot at some point, because the coronavirus will continue to change, said Dr. Megan Ranney, a practicing emergency physician and academic dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University.\n\n“The question is, is that moment today? Or is it sometime down the road, either when we are seeing signs that another surge is hitting us or just in the fall, the same way that we do for flu shot?”\n\nWhat vaccines will be used for second booster shots?\n\nThe vaccines currently available for second booster shots are the same ones that have been given for initial doses and boosters throughout the pandemic.\n\nBut boosters that people receive this fall or winter could be completely different, Moss said. For instance, it could be a protein-based vaccine – like the one from Novavax, which has applied for FDA authorization – it could be a vaccine administered as a nasal spray, or it could be a vaccine specifically developed to target a certain variant, such as Omicron.\n\n“There’s been a discussion for several months now about Omicron-specific vaccines, and my understanding is that the data on those will be available in May. But many people may be better off – if not most people – getting an Omicron-specific booster should that become available. The timing on that is not clear,” Moss said. “The point is that in the coming months to year, there may be more options for booster doses that actually may be better than another dose of the original mRNA vaccine.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet next week to discuss the need for Covid-19 vaccine booster doses in the future, including the process for selecting variant-specific boosters.\n\nSome companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, are developing variant-specific vaccines that could target whatever strain is circulating when the booster might be needed. Pfizer and Moderna also have said they are working on a vaccine that would specifically protect against the Omicron variant.\n\n“There may be a need for people to get an additional booster in the fall along with a more general booster campaign, if that takes place,” Marks said Tuesday. “Because we may need to shift over to a different variant coverage,” like a formula developed to target a specific variant or a mix of variants.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/health/covid-second-booster/index.html", "title": "Second booster shots authorized for adults 50 and older | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has expanded the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines to allow adults 50 and older to get a second booster as early as four months after their first booster dose of any Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe move extends the availability of additional boosters to healthy older adults. The FDA had previously allowed additional shots for anyone 12 or older who was severely immune-deficient. This group of people can now receive a three-dose primary series and two boosters for a total of five doses.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit, saying it is updating its vaccine pages to reflect the FDA’s expanded eligibility.\n\n“Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals. Based on an analysis of emerging data, a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release.\n\n“Additionally, the data show that an initial booster dose is critical in helping to protect all adults from the potentially severe outcomes of COVID-19. So, those who have not received their initial booster dose are strongly encouraged to do so.”\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had determined that the known and potential benefits of second boosters outweigh the known and potential risks for these populations.\n\nThe CDC also said in its statement that adults who got Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine as their primary and first booster shots at least four months prior may now get an additional booster of Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines.\n\n“Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster 4 months after their prior dose to increase their protection further,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in the statement. “This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19 as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time.”\n\nShe said that both the CDC and the FDA “continue to evaluate the need for additional booster doses for all Americans.”\n\nThe CDC’s update is what’s known as a permissive recommendation, a statement that the shots may be used in this age group for those who want them, reflecting a degree of uncertainty in the science. But it’s not an official recommendation.\n\nThe lack of a clear endorsement for second boosters punts the work of weighing the risks and benefits of another vaccine dose to individuals, and it has caused no small amount of consternation for some vaccine advocates who say the marginal extra protection some may get won’t be worth the confusion fourth doses create.\n\nDr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician who is the academic dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, says that throughout the pandemic, officials have been faced with making policy before they’ve had enough evidence to back it. Ranney sees this as another example.\n\nShe says it’s not clear whether everybody needs a fourth dose right now, but having these approvals in place will provide flexibility to roll more boosters out quickly if they’re needed.\n\n“I see this approval from the Biden administration as being an insurance policy on their part,” Ranney says. “It’s a way to allow people to get the vaccine or the additional booster. But it also provides them with the flexibility so that should BA.2 be worse than we’re expecting, they can then quickly roll it out. or God forbid, should there be another variant in the next couple of months that requires another booster they can quickly roll it out. So I’m reading it that way,” Ranney said.\n\nThere is general scientific agreement that third doses help strengthen immunity against severe illness from the virus that causes Covid-19. But the science is far from settled on when, or even if, fourth doses might be needed since the vaccines continue to offer a high degree of protection against Covid-19 hospitalization and death, even as protection against illness wanes.\n\nMuch of the evidence examining the safety and effectiveness of a second booster shot comes from Israel, which has been recommending a fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine to adults 18 and older since the end of January.\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had reviewed data from Israel’s Ministry of Health on more than 700,000 people 18 and up who had received second boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months after their first booster. More than 600,000 of those people were over 60. The agency said that data had revealed no new safety problems tied to a fourth dose.\n\nThe FDA said data on the safety of the Moderna boosters, when used as a fourth dose, comes from a study of 120 people ages 18 and older who got a fourth dose of the vaccine at least four months after their third shot of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety concerns were identified in the three weeks following the last dose.\n\nSome of the data the FDA relied on to make its decision comes from previously published studies.\n\nIn a large study of more than half a million adults over the age of 60, those who received a second booster, or fourth dose, of a Covid-19 vaccine had 78% lower odds of death during the Omicron wave compared to those who had a third shot at least four months earlier. But the numbers of deaths were relatively low in both groups. After 40 days of follow up, there were 232 total deaths out of nearly 234,000 people who’d only had three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with 92 deaths out of 328,000 people.\n\nA smaller study of health care workers, which included younger adults, found that fourth boosters were safe and restored antibodies to the same levels reached after third doses. But fourth doses were only moderately effective – about 30 to 40% – at preventing illness. And most of the workers who got sick still had high viral loads, suggested that they were capable of transmitting the infection to others.\n\nAdditional studies from the UK show that the antibody boost from a booster dose wanes very quickly, within a matter of weeks. So some experts feel that considering available resources and the diminishing appetite to continue to get more and more boosters, that the United States should wait until there’s a clear danger from a new wave of infections to roll out fourth doses. Some see the likely timing of that to be next fall.\n\n“If you have only one bullet in your gun to shoot, I would prefer to hold fire until the fall, because that’s when cases may really start to increase,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince January, Americans 12 and older have been eligible for a third vaccine dose, but only 46% of that demographic group has had a third shot.\n\nSchaffner says he’s worried that fourth doses will just confuse people who haven’t decided to get a third dose.\n\n“I’m very concerned about dividing and not being able to conquer because the messaging will get very, very confusing,” he said, “And so I think public health officials and clinicians ought to be continuing to focus on getting the third dose into people who are eligible.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/health/fauci-covid-second-boosters-adults-under-50/index.html", "title": "US will get an answer on second boosters for adults under 50 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS health officials have been in active discussions with the Food and Drug Administration on whether the agency will authorize a second booster vaccine for Americans under 50 years old, the nation’s top infectious disease expert shared Saturday.\n\n“Hopefully we’ll get an answer reasonably soon,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN’s Laura Coates.\n\nSecond boosters have been authorized for US adults 50 and up, as well as certain people with weakened immune systems, since March. But for anyone under the age of 50, only one booster is authorized.\n\nFauci’s comments come amid a worrisome time in the pandemic for many across the country. Daily Covid-19 case rates have surged again and hospitalizations and deaths are also up, fueled by the Omicron offshoot BA.5, which experts have said is the most contagious variant yet.\n\nLast week, the subvariant caused almost two out of every three new Covid-19 infections in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently said while experts don’t yet know much about the severity of the variant, “we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading.”\n\n“People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5,” she said.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House Covid-19 response team urged Americans who were over 50 to get a second vaccine booster but had less to offer Americans under that age range, saying the FDA is considering second boosters for that age group.\n\nAs of the end of June, adults under 50 had the highest rates of Covid-19 cases compared to other age groups, according to preliminary data from the CDC.\n\nResponse coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said FDA and CDC experts were “thinking about this and looking at the data.” And as they do, some Americans have expressed frustration at having to wait for the government to expand booster eligibility to younger adults.\n\nIn addition to staying up to date with vaccinations when eligible, Americans can also help bring down the levels of circulating virus by masking up and testing “so that you can keep people separated who are infected.”\n\n“You cut down on that likelihood that you’re going to get new variants,” Fauci said Saturday. “And, in regard to the vaccines, it’s important that you try to not only get a booster but, as you get more variants, we’re going to be upgrading and updating the next level of boosters so that by the time we get to the fall, it is very likely we’ll have an updated booster that will address better the circulating variant at that time.”\n\nOn Friday, the Biden administration also extended the Covid-19 public health emergency (PHE), which will help “provide us with tools and authorities needed to respond to the highly transmissible Covid-19 subvariants that are currently circulating around the country,” one administration official told CNN.\n\n“The PHE provides essential capabilities and flexibilities to hospitals to better care for patients, particularly if we were to see a significant increase in hospitalizations in the coming weeks,” the official said.", "authors": ["Carma Hassan Christina Maxouris", "Carma Hassan", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/health/fda-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-authorized/index.html", "title": "FDA authorizes Pfizer and Moderna's updated Covid-19 boosters ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized updated Covid-19 vaccine booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer. This is the first time updated Covid-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the United States.\n\nBoth are bivalent vaccines that combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages.\n\nPfizer’s updated vaccine is a 30-microgram dose authorized for people age 12 and older. Moderna’s updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older.\n\nThe shots can be administered after they’re recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s vaccine advisory group is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation.\n\nAn OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days – both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven’t been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases.\n\nBooster shift\n\nThe updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive.\n\n“With today’s authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,” the FDA said.\n\nIndividuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule.\n\nPeople too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine.\n\nThe FDA said it will “work quickly” to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it’s working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\n“We want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that’s why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent – the original – booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series – and less than a third of the total population – has also gotten a booster.\n\nThere’s no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a “transitional year,” when people need to make sure they have a “good base upon which we build … which will help protect us against the unknown.”\n\n“If you’ve not yet received a booster dose, or it’s been several months since your last booster dose, now’s the time to consider getting one,” Marks said.\n\nOfficials defend swift authorization\n\nOn Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week.\n\n“The public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,” Marks said.\n\nThe agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it’s a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer.\n\n“We have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. “The FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.”\n\nIn addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1.\n\nHuman studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies’ original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday. Data from those studies is expected in another month or two.\n\nVaccine milestone\n\n“America is the first country in the world that has authorized a bivalent vaccine where the bivalent vaccine targets the viruses out there,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who is leading the White House Covid-19 response, said in a phone interview with CNN on Wednesday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We try to do this every year for the flu. We almost never hit it on the mark. This has taken a lot of work by FDA. It’s been about leaning into the science, leaning into some very good modeling. And then really demanding from the companies that they produce vaccines that are going to be that are going to be matched.”\n\nThe Omicron BA.5 subvariant has dominated transmission in the United States for more than two months. Last week, it caused 89% – nearly 9 out of 10 – new Covid infections in this country, according to the latest estimates from the CDC.\n\nA recent offshoot of the BA.4 variant, BA.4.6, has slowly grown in prevalence to claim second place. Across the country, it caused about 8% of new infections last week, but it has taken off more in the Midwest – Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska – causing an estimated 17% of new infections there.", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas Brenda Goodman", "Naomi Thomas", "Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-for-kids-6-to-17/index.html", "title": "CDC director signs off on Moderna Covid-19 vaccine for people ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on a recommendation of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for people ages 6 to 17, the agency announced Friday. The move clears the way for the vaccine to be administered to this age group.\n\nThe recommendation comes after the CDC’s vaccine advisers, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, voted unanimously on Thursday to support recommending the two-dose Moderna Covid-19 vaccine for use in people ages 6 through 17. The vaccine received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration last week.\n\n“It is critical that we protect our children and teens from the complications of severe COVID-19 disease,” Walensky said in a statement on Friday. “Today, we have expanded the options available to families by recommending a second safe and effective vaccine for children ages 6 through 17 years. Vaccinating this age group can provide greater confidence to families that their children and adolescents participating in childcare, school, and other activities will have less risk for serious COVID-19 illness.”\n\nACIP endorsement\n\nThe CDC’s advisers endorsed the vaccine after hearing details about Moderna’s application to the FDA and the latest safety data.\n\n“There is a risk of myocarditis/pericarditis after both messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines, most cases have prompt improvement in symptoms. A follow up survey suggests most fully recovered from myocarditis,” said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of medicine from Vanderbilt University during ACIP’s discussion of the vaccine Thursday. She added that myocarditis after vaccination has been generally mild compared to those who developed myocarditis after getting sick from Covid-19.\n\nThe CDC said that the risk of myocarditis “may be higher” with the Moderna vaccine than from vaccination from Pfizer, but there are limitations to what scientists know about the condition in this age group since the data is observational and limited.\n\nOverall, the data presented from the company showed that most children got the vaccine without incident.\n\n“In general, most adverse events reported after Covid vaccines are mild and transient events like injection site and systemic reactions,” said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, the Deputy Director of the H1N1 Vaccine Task Force at the CDC. “We will continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines and we will continue to work with partners, both within the federal government and with health care providers and provider organizations to better understand these types of adverse events.”\n\nDuring the pandemic over 5.1 million Covid-19 cases have occurred among children ages 5 through 11 according to a presentation at the meeting from the CDC’s Dr. Sara Oliver.\n\nIn April unvaccinated children between the ages of 5 to 17 overall had a two times greater risk of testing positive for Covid-19 than unvaccinated children with the primary series of the vaccine.\n\nThere’s also been an increase in hospitalizations among this age group, particularly during the Omicron surge. Among adolescents ages 12 to 17, the cumulative rates of Covid-19 hospitalizations are “considerably higher” than for flu during all prior flu seasons, Oliver, a member of the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service told the committee. The possibility that children could develop long Covid, even if they had a mild or asymptomatic Covid case, is also a significant concern.\n\nChildren are the least vaccinated group among all the age groups in the US. About 65% of children in the 5 through 11 age group and 30% of adolescents have not been vaccinated, the CDC said. The CDC hopes more parents will protect their children with a vaccination.\n\n“We can predict with future Covid-19 surges, the unvaccinated will continue to bear the burden of disease,” said Oliver.\n\nVaccine details\n\nFor children ages 6 through 11, the Moderna vaccine is administered as a two-dose series at 50 micrograms per dose.\n\nAdolescents ages 12 through 17 receive the same amount that is administered in adults – a two-dose series at 100 micrograms per dose.\n\nModerna’s vaccine is already available for people ages 6 months through 5 years and 18 and older.\n\nPeople ages 6 to 17 were already eligible to be vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n“There are 25 million unvaccinated children and adolescents right now. We know that the benefits outweigh the risks for mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in all ages,” Oliver said. “Receipt of this primary series continues to be the safest way to prevent serious Covid-19.”\n\nModerna boosters\n\nThe CDC did not take up a booster dose issue for the Moderna vaccine, since it is not authorized by the FDA yet, but Dr. Doran Fink, the deputy director of the clinical division of vaccines and related products applications of the FDA said they would address this gap during the summer.\n\n“We would expect to be addressing this gap in booster doses over the summer,” Fink told the committee.\n\nThe agency is collecting more data to determine if a booster dose is necessary.\n\nSome children and adolescents, depending on their age, who have received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine are eligible for a booster dose.\n\nAddressing confusing labels\n\nThe CDC promised its independent vaccine adviser committee that it would create multiple fact sheets and more education opportunities for vaccine administrators due to what it called a “confusing label situation” with Moderna’s vaccine vials.\n\nTo distinguish between vials, Moderna has used different color caps and has used a different color border around the label. For the six months through 5 years age group that gets a smaller 25 microgram dose, for example, the cap is dark blue and the border is magenta. For children ages 6 through 11, who will get a bigger dosage size at 50 micrograms, the vial has a dark blue cap as well, but the border is purple. The same vial is used for booster doses for adults 18 years of age and older. The label on that product also says it can be used for booster doses.\n\n“We recognize that that label for ages 6 through 11 stating ‘BOOSTER DOSES’ in all caps is very confusing,” the CDC’s Dr. Elisha Hall, the clinical guidelines lead for the Covid-19 emergency response told the committee Thursday. “There will be multiple education and communication materials and efforts to communicate the authorized use of this vial for ages 6 through 11.”\n\nShe said the CDC will also offer educational webinars to help providers.\n\n“With all of these new products out, there may be more opportunities for vaccine administration errors. Besides just the number of products, of course, the products that are not labeled for the indicated age group.

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 13-1 earlier Wednesday in favor of recommending the expanded use of Covid-19 boosters for children in this age group.\n\nThe CDC had ​authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use as a booster in ages 16 and 17 in December.\n\n“It is critical that we protect our children and teens from COVID-19 infection and the complications of severe disease,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a news release. “Today, I endorsed ACIP’s vote to expand eligibility and strengthen our recommendations for booster doses. We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series. This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. I encourage all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”\n\nThe ACIP recommendation came after the members heard research on rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in young people who have gotten Covid-19 vaccines and noting that many parents are concerned about long-term side effects of vaccines. They also considered that vaccine uptake among 12- to 17-year-olds has slowed recently and weighed the record numbers of Covid-19 cases in children amid a surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC signed off Tuesday on shortening the booster interval from six months to five months for people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It has also recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised 5- to 11-year-olds receive an additional primary dose 28 days after their second shot; only the Pfizer/BioNTech shot is authorized for that age group.\n\nPfizer’s booster dose contains the same amount of the vaccine as the initial doses: 30 micrograms.\n\nAdolescents ages 12 to 15 became eligible to receive their initial series of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in mid-May, opening vaccinations up to about 17 million additional people.\n\nNow, about half of the 12 to 15 population – about 8.7 million – is fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 5 million of them have been fully vaccinated for more than five months and are now eligible to receive a booster shot.\n\nChildren in this age group represent about 5% of the total US population. They account for about 4% of the fully vaccinated population in the US and about 3% of those eligible to receive a booster shot, according to the latest CDC data.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn October, the CDC recommended that adults who had completed their initial series of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least six months ago receive a booster shot, along with those who received their initial Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago.\n\nOverall, about 71.6 million people in the US are fully vaccinated and boosted against Covid-19. That’s less than half of the nearly 180 million people who are eligible to receive their booster shot and about a fifth of the total US population.

The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nWhere can I get an updated Covid-19 booster?\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nWho should get an updated booster?\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nWhen should I get an updated booster?\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nCan people get other vaccines at the same time as the updated booster?\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen can younger children get an updated booster?\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nCan immunocompromised people get an updated booster?\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nAre the updated Covid-19 boosters safe?\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nHow do we know the updated Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nWhy were the shots updated?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/coronavirus-omicron-travel-vaccine-children-health-wellness/index.html", "title": "Should your child receive the updated Covid-19 booster? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nLast week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance recommending the updated Covid-19 booster for children ages 5 to 11. Previously, the bivalent booster was recommended for children 12 and older, as well as for all adults. Now, the Pfizer/BioNTech booster is available for children 5 and older, and the Moderna booster can be given to children 6 and older.\n\nA health care worker administers a Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to a child at a vaccination site in San Francisco on January 10. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhat should parents consider when deciding whether to get the updated booster for their children? Are there circumstances that might prompt families to wait? Are there any downsides? What about children who just turned 5 — should they get the new booster? If a child has not been vaccinated yet, are they eligible for the updated booster?\n\nTo guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health,” and the mother of two young children.\n\nCNN: Who is now eligible to receive the updated Covid-19 booster? Does it matter how many vaccines they’ve previously received?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Essentially, everyone 5 and above can receive the new bivalent Covid-19 booster, as long as they have completed their primary vaccine series. It doesn’t matter how many boosters they may have had. That means a child who received just the initial two doses of Pfizer or Moderna can get the booster, as can a child who already got one booster dose, as long as it’s been at least two months since their last vaccine dose.\n\nCNN: What should parents and caregivers consider before choosing the updated booster for their children?\n\nWen: There are two key questions to ask. First, is your child at high risk for severe illness due to Covid-19? The most important reason to get vaccinated is to reduce the chance of hospitalization and other severe outcomes. The initial two doses of the vaccine are very good at achieving this for most children. Some may still be at higher risk for worse outcomes, however — if a child has serious underlying medical conditions, for example, is on chemotherapy or is a transplant recipient. A booster dose would be advisable in these circumstances.\n\nSecond, is it very important for you to avoid Covid-19 infection in your children? Many families have decided that once their kids are vaccinated, if the risk of severe illness is very low, they do not prioritize eliminating Covid-19 infection.\n\nOn the other hand, others remain very vigilant and cautious. Perhaps they are concerned about the unknowns around long Covid. Perhaps they want to avoid their kids being sick, leading to missed school days and work days for caregivers. Or perhaps there is another household member to protect, such as an elderly grandparent or someone else with chronic underlying conditions. All of these are reasonable considerations for getting kids the booster sooner than later.\n\nThose age 5 and older can get the bivalent Covid-19 booster if they've received a primary vaccine series, the CDC said. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nOne thing I’ll caution is that we don’t know how long the booster will be effective in reducing symptomatic infection. Some studies have shown that the effectiveness of the primary vaccine against symptomatic infection may wane within a few months. That said, a lot can happen with Covid-19. We could see rising cases this fall and winter. There could be a new variant that becomes dominant. Many parents may want to get their kids optimal protection in case of another surge, and then decide again next year if another booster is needed.\n\nCNN: Are there circumstances that might prompt families to wait to boost their kids?\n\nWen: If a child has just had Covid-19, I think it’s advisable to wait at least three months, as the CDC recommends before boosting. Reinfection is unlikely in this time period, and it might be beneficial to allow the body time to develop its own immune response.\n\nThe same goes with a previous vaccine. The CDC says that children and adults can get the updated booster as long as it’s been at least two months since their last vaccine shot.\n\nI think these are both minimum intervals. Many experts, including me, believe that there is benefit to waiting longer — perhaps four to six months — after infection or last vaccination. That longer time period can allow the body to develop improved immunity before another boost, as some studies have suggested. However, I also understand and appreciate the CDC’s need to have streamlined guidance, and it’s reasonable to follow their guidelines as stated.\n\nCNN: Is there any downside to giving kids the booster?\n\nWen: This is an important question to ask. The way that I’d answer is to clarify that every intervention — including vaccines — has upsides and potential downsides. Parents and families will weigh the upsides and downsides differently. The evidence is very clear that for the initial vaccines, the upsides far outweigh any potential risk. The evidence is less clear for boosters.\n\nIn the case of a child with serious underlying medical conditions, for example, there is a significant upside to getting the booster to prevent severe outcomes due to Covid-19. For other children, especially for younger children under 12, the initial vaccines are probably still very protective, and it’s not yet clear what the added benefit of the booster is in reducing the risk of hospitalization.\n\nThere are some common side effects to Covid-19 vaccines. The vast majority are benign and self-resolving; symptoms like body aches, fatigue, fever, and soreness around the site of the booster jab usually go away in a couple of days. (There are very rare cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle most often seen in the adolescent male. These, too, tend to resolve on their own and do not cause long-term effects.) Broadly speaking, these should not be a major consideration for parents.\n\nThe CDC has recommended the booster, and I think it’s reasonable for parents who wish to follow the guidance to do so. For those on the fence, having a frank conversation with your pediatrician about your family’s specific circumstances can also guide you in your decision.\n\nCNN: What about children who just turned 5 — should they get the new booster?\n\nWen: I have a son who recently turned 5, and received his primary series when he was 4. His last shot was in July. I am not planning to give him the booster yet. I’m waiting at least six months for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nCNN: Can parents and caregivers choose to give their kids a dose of the original booster?\n\nWen: No. The US Food and Drug Administration has withdrawn its authorization for the original monovalent vaccine and replaced it with the updated bivalent booster. That means you can only receive the updated booster. That applies to children as well as adults.\n\nCNN: If a child has not been vaccinated yet, are they eligible for the updated booster?\n\nWen: No. Children who have not yet been vaccinated can only receive the original vaccine for their primary series. Parents who wish for their kids to get the updated bivalent vaccine have to complete the primary series — two doses of Pfizer or Moderna — and then get the updated booster.\n\nI want to emphasize the importance of the primary series. Numerous studies have found that the first two doses are highly protective against severe illness, including in kids. In one New England Journal of Medicine study, the first two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines reduced hospitalization among children by more than 80%. This should be a call to action for families who have not yet gotten their kids any Covid-19 vaccines to get them the initial vaccination.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}]}

In the motion to approve the settlement, the users who brought the suit pointed to changes Facebook has made in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica breach, including restricting third-party access to user data and improving communications to users about how their data is collected and shared.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica leak began with a psychology professor who harvested data on millions of Facebook users through an app offering a personality test, then gave it to a service promising to use vague and sophisticated techniques to influence voters during a high-stakes election where the winning presidential candidate won narrowly in several key states.\n\nA 2020 report by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office later cast significant doubt on Cambridge Analytica’s capabilities, suggesting many of them had been exaggerated. But the improper sharing of Facebook data triggered a cascade of events that has culminated in investigations and lawsuits.\n\nThe scandal prompted a global outcry that led to hearings, an apology tour from Zuckerberg and various changes to the platform. Facebook agreed in 2019 to a $5 billion privacy settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission over the privacy breach, and to a $100 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that it misled investors about the risks of misuse of user data.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/facebook-internet-tracking-settlement/index.html", "title": "Meta agrees to pay $90 million to settle lawsuit over Facebook ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta has agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old class action lawsuit over a practice that allowed the social network to track users’ activity across the internet, even if they had logged out of the platform.\n\nThe settlement, announced on Tuesday, is one of the largest in the history of the social media company, but it’s unlikely to impact the bottom line of the $590 billion internet giant. If approved, the agreement will also rank among the 10 largest data privacy class action settlements in the United States, according to DiCello Levitt Gutzler, one of the law firms involved in bringing the case.\n\n“Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we’re glad to move past this issue,” Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNN Business. The company has denied any wrongdoing as part of the deal.\n\nThe case, filed in 2012, dates back to a 2010 update by Facebook called “Open Graph,” which was designed to give users’ friends a closer look at their activity and interests across the internet. As part of the update, the company launched a “Like” button plug-in on sites across the internet, which users could hit to highlight their interests to their Facebook networks.\n\nThe “Like” button plug-in also allowed Facebook to gather data, using cookies, about users’ activity on that site — including, for example, what sites they visit, items they viewed or purchased, and communications they had with that site — regardless of whether the user actually used the button or even knew it was there, according to court documents.\n\nTo alleviate privacy concerns, the company said at the time that it would not collect user-identifying cookies about a user’s activity on partner websites while they were logged out of Facebook. However, researchers found that Facebook continued to collect some identifying cookies on users’ internet activity even after they logged out of the platform, contrary to its promise. After the issue was publicized in 2011, Facebook initially defended the practice but later issued a fix and clarified its policies. The class members in the case accused the company of breach of contract.\n\nThe legal battle dragged on for years. In 2017, after the plaintiffs had submitted a third updated complaint, a judge granted Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and in 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partly reversed the decision. Facebook appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, opening the door for the parties to begin negotiating the settlement.\n\nThe settlement applies to US Facebook users who had an account between April 22, 2010, and September 26, 2011, and who visited non-Facebook websites that displayed the “Like” button, a list that included everything from Pandora to ESPN.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Meta agreed to delete the user data it collected through this practice.\n\n“It’s truly a wake-up call for internet and advertising companies who collect user data and use advanced browser tracking,” Stephen Grygiel, one of the lead attorneys representing the class members, said in a statement about the settlement.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/27/creative-legislating-empty-streets-disaster-declarations-news-around-states/111466648/", "title": "Creative legislating, empty streets: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state on Wednesday reported its first coronavirus death as the total number of confirmed cases reached nearly 400, officials said. Gov. Kay Ivey and the Alabama Department of Public Health confirmed the Jackson County resident died from the COVID-19 disease. “I continue to urge everyone that this virus is real, it is deadly, and we should continue to maintain social distancing as much as possible,” Ivey said. The patient had underlying health problems and passed away in a facility outside the state, the Health Department said. The Jackson County Commission said the person was a part-time employee at the county courthouse, and the area is being cleaned before employees return to work. The death came as the number of confirmed cases in the state through limited testing jumped by more than 100 to 386 on Wednesday, with a third of those in Jefferson County, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Officials at the University of Alabama at Birmingham said UAB hospital on Wednesday morning was treating at least 90 people with confirmed cases of COVID-19, and more than half were on ventilators.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some Alaska regional air carriers have cut services to communities and positions from their payrolls in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Alaska Public Media reports the cuts followed a March 20 appeal by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy for residents to stop nonessential travel. Ravn Air, Alaska’s largest regional carrier that serves more than 100 communities, recently announced it would temporarily cut 146 of about 1,300 jobs. The reduction is “due to a dramatic reduction in passenger bookings resulting from the recent arrival of the COVID-19 coronavirus,” the company said in a statement. Tourism cancellations have hurt other small airlines that rely on spring travel revenue. “All tour charters have been canceled, so this time of year is typically fairly robust because now is peak season for Aurora viewing and particularly among international travelers, so those have gone away,” said Matt Atkinson, safety director for Warbelow’s Air. The Fairbanks carrier also provides essential services including transporting telecommunications repair workers, medical evacuations, and delivering fuel and mail.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Officials from the state’s health department and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spent hours Wednesday scouring a shuttered hospital to see how quickly it could be running if an expected surge of coronavirus cases hits. The state is looking to reopen two closed Phoenix hospitals and convert a specialty hospital. The review of the closed St. Luke’s Medical Center is part of an effort to nearly double hospital capacity from the current 16,900 to the nearly 30,000 officials say might be needed by May. The quickest way to boost capacity is if existing hospitals convert other areas to patient care, something they are already planning to do. Hospitals are planning to convert recovery rooms, unused surgical suites and other areas to boost capacity. The number of coronavirus cases in the state has now risen to more than 500 with eight dead, health officials said Thursday. Meanwhile, the Navajo Nation has reported 20 more cases of the coronavirus on its sprawling reservation, for a total of 69.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A basketball arena was transformed into the state House chamber due to coronavirus concerns as lawmakers met Thursday to address a budget shortfall Arkansas faces because of the outbreak. The House and Senate were expected to move quickly on a plan to allow Gov. Asa Hutchinson to tap into the state’s surplus because of the $353 million shortfall. Legislative leaders say they hope to wrap up the session shortly after 12 a.m. Saturday. Arkansas has had at least 335 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, and two deaths. The 100-member House moved to the Jack Stephens Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, with members sitting in the stands of the 5,600-seat arena. Members, staff and press were screened before they could enter the arena and were handed small bottles of hand sanitizer.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homeless outreach workers are passing out hand sanitizer, checking temperatures and pleading with people not to crowd together. But a week after Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged thousands of hotel rooms to help the homeless survive the coronavirus pandemic, most of those rooms sit empty. For most of California’s estimated 150,000 homeless, the message they’re getting – if they get one at all – is to isolate themselves if they feel sick and call a doctor if symptoms worsen. “Obviously these are people who are writing recommendations who don’t have any direct experience with what a person goes through when they are homeless,” said Joe Smith, advocacy director for Loaves & Fishes, a Sacramento nonprofit group that provides meals and services to the homeless. Smith said he hasn’t seen any outreach from public officials to homeless people, many of whom live in tent encampments with dozens or hundreds of people at each site. Statewide, cities and counties said they are setting up hand-washing stations, portable toilets and arranging for trash pickup at larger encampments as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A statewide stay-at-home order went into effect Thursday in an attempt to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Jared Polis announced Wednesday that he was taking the “extreme measure” because the restrictions taken to date haven’t been enough to reduce the spread of the virus. “If we don’t take these actions that we are taking today, and, frankly, if you don’t stay home, this will create a much worse economic disaster with greater disruption, greater loss of jobs for a longer period of time,” the Democratic governor said. Under the order, which is in effect until April 11, people should only leave home for necessities like grocery shopping, seeking medical care or exercise, or taking care of a vulnerable person. People who work for a business considered essential can travel to work. As of Wednesday, 1,086 people in Colorado have tested positive, and 19 have died. The number of people hospitalized doubled between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Businesses and nonprofits harmed by the coronavirus pandemic can begin applying for short-term, no-interest loans under a new program administered by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development, details of which were released Thursday. Small businesses and nonprofits with 100 or fewer employees that are in good standing with the Department of Revenue Services and have been profitable prior to March 10 can apply for one-year, no-interest loans of as much as $75,000 to help with cash flow. Businesses and nonprofits eligible for the $25 million Connecticut Recovery Bridge Loan Program may apply online and request a six-month extension. Companies involved in real estate, multilevel marketing, adult entertainment, cannabis and firearms are not eligible. New Haven on Thursday announced its own “economic resiliency program,” dubbed Together New Haven.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A 66-year-old man from southern Delaware is the state’s first coronavirus death, public health officials said Thursday. Officials said the Sussex County man had underlying health conditions and died while hospitalized out of state. As of Thursday, 130 coronavirus cases have been reported in Delaware, including 86 in New Castle County, 27 from Sussex County and 17 in Kent County. The individuals range in age from 1 to 90. Thirteen are hospitalized in Delaware, with seven reported to be critically ill. Two other Delaware residents are hospitalized out of state. Meanwhile, some of the state’s homeless shelters are limiting their beds to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Salvation Army’s shelter for women and children in Wilmington, for instance, is no longer taking in new clients. It has 42 women and children, which is 10 fewer than capacity, said Capt. Timothy Sheehan, Delaware coordinator for the Salvation Army.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser on Thursday expressed her outrage and demanded action after the district was given only $500 million – $725 million less than individual states – in the Senate-approved $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package, WUSA-TV reports. The 50 states in the nation are set to receive a direct payment of $1.25 billion, and some larger cities within those states get additional funding, officials said. With the exception of voting representation in Congress, D.C. is treated like a state in essentially every other aspect, such as tax revenue. “We just need to be treated fairly. We just want what every taxpaying American is getting out of this bill,” Bowser said. “Everybody who lives and works here has a stake in that.” Bowser said federal leaders are treating D.C. like a territory, and she wants lawmakers to treat D.C. fairly. Bowser said not only does the district have a larger population than several states, but residents also pay more taxes than some states.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state’s diagnosed coronavirus cases jumped sharply Thursday, at least partly because testing has become more widespread, and Miami-area hospitals were treating about a dozen crew members from two cruise ships that remained offshore. The state health department said more than 2,350 people had tested positive for the new coronavirus, a 35% increase from Wednesday’s total. The number of deaths jumped from 21 to 27. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he expects the number of diagnosed cases will continue to rise as testing sites open around the state for people suspected of having the disease and others who are at high risk of contracting it, such as health care workers. The disease is also taking a tough toll on the state’s economy, with 74,000 residents applying for unemployment benefits last week, a tenfold increase over the week before. Since then, the state’s tourism industry has essentially shut down, and restaurants have been restricted to takeout and delivery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The governor on Thursday extended an order to keep the state’s public schools closed in the wake of the new coronavirus, as the death toll in the state rose to 48. As of noon Thursday, 473 people were hospitalized because of the virus, according to data from the Georgia Department of Public Health. The state is reporting 1,525 confirmed cases, though testing has been limited, and results can sometimes take days to receive. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s order keeps K-12 public schools across the state closed through April 24 and closes public colleges and universities for the rest of the semester. Many school districts had already decided to extend closures on their own. With infections spreading rapidly, some hospitals are struggling to keep up. Dougherty County in southwest Georgia has been particularly hard-hit. With 156 confirmed cases, the county has an infection rate many times higher than the rest of the state. A large influx of coronavirus patients has stretched resources thin at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany as officials scramble to find more bed space.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui residents have been using signs and checkpoints to help enforce a government order to keep visitors off Hana Highway during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Democratic Gov. David Ige instructed the state Department of Transportation on March 18 to limit access along the highway on Maui’s eastern coast to residents, first responders and delivery trucks until further notice, The Maui News reports. Maui County Mayor Michael Victorino also closed the Piilani Highway to nonresidents from Hana to Ulupalakua and the Kahekili Highway from Waihee to Kahakuloa Village. There was no significant decrease in visitors on Hana Highway for recreational purposes since the restriction was announced, said Napua Hueu, director of the Hana Highway Regulation committee. Residents have painted their own signs to discourage recreational travel along Hana Highway, Hueu said. “It is imperative we reduce nonessential, recreational visitor travel along the Hana Highway to safeguard the health of our rural communities,” Hueu said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state jumped by more than 50% Thursday morning, less than 24 hours after Gov. Brad Little announced a statewide stay-at-home order. There are now more than 138 people in 17 counties confirmed to have COVID-19 in Idaho, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The university’s tally updates more frequently than the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s online count. The areas with the highest concentration of cases include Blaine County, which has been Idaho’s epicenter of COVID-19 infection with more than 63 cases, and Ada County, with more than 39 confirmed cases. Little’s stay-at-home order requires Idaho’s 1.75 million residents to self-isolate at home unless they are health care workers, public safety employees or other “essential workers” such as grocery store employees.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hundreds of health care facilities in the state that largely serve low-income and minority communities are facing financial chaos because they’ve canceled most routine doctor visits in an attempt to stymie the coronavirus pandemic, according to an industry organization’s report. The internal financial review completed Wednesday for the Illinois Primary Health Care Association found that, without help, the state’s federally established community health centers face losses of $181 million and 4,350 layoffs in the next three months. Meanwhile Thursday morning, Chicago police began turning joggers and others away from the city’s lakefront trails, hours after Mayor Lori Lightfoot threatened to shut them down if people would not stop crowding the areas. Illinois’ stay-at-home order that took effect Saturday allows people to exercise outdoors, but officials in Chicago said people were getting too close to one another on the trails and in lakefront parks Wednesday as temperatures warmed.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A new light show at Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis is aimed at inspiring hope during the coronavirus pandemic. A heart projected on one building pulsates and changes size and color, while images of the globe and various countries are projected on another as a recording plays of Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge over Troubled Water” being performed by two Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra musicians. Bob Schultz, senior vice president of marketing and events for the business group Downtown Indy, said the display was prepared in a few days and debuted Tuesday night. “This is a message of love to the world and united we stand,” Schultz told the Indianapolis Business Journal. “We wanted to keep it simple and connect as many people as possible to that message.” The two-minute production plays multiple times nightly from 9 p.m. to midnight. Downtown Indy isn’t encouraging people to visit the Circle to watch it unless they are already out for a walk. It has posted a video of it on the group’s website for at-home viewing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Unemployment claims rose nearly nineteenfold in the state last week as the coronavirus pandemic that inflicted economic pain across the country left entire sectors of the job market in tatters, officials reported Thursday as the state recorded its biggest daily increase in cases. The U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial claims for jobless benefits in the state surged to 41,890 in the week that ended March 21. That was up from 2,229 the week prior, a historic spike that laid bare the virus’s sudden economic impact. The number of confirmed Iowa cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, jumped Thursday to 179, which was an increase of 34 over Wednesday’s figure and the the biggest daily jump yet for the state. One Iowa patient has died. Like many counterparts in other states, Gov. Kim Reynolds has ordered the temporary closure of schools, bars, dine-in restaurants, theaters, casinos and barbershops in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly and the state’s top health official are expressing growing frustration as Kansas grapples with an continuing increase in coronavirus cases. Kelly, a Democrat, on Wednesday said President Donald Trump’s suggestion that restrictions on people’s movements could be loosened by Easter to help the economy is “wishful thinking,” and she argued that the federal government should invoke the national Defense Production Act to address shortages of ventilators, protective masks and testing kits, a move Trump has said isn’t necessary. “We, along with all of the other states, are really kind of begging the federal government to get their act together,” Kelly said in an interview. Meanwhile, Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said people should stay home as much as possible, even if they don’t live in a county that has issued a stay-at-home order. He said some residents are trying to exploit exceptions in the orders.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Reconvening after a weeklong break, state lawmakers worked on a coronavirus-relief measure Thursday to help cushion workers and employers from economic damage caused by the pandemic. The relief bill comes amid a dramatically shrinking economy as businesses statewide close or scale back operations and tens of thousands more Kentucky residents file for unemployment benefits. Finishing work on a new state budget and the virus-relief measure top the priority list, but lawmakers took up other bills Thursday, including expanding the attorney general’s authority to regulate abortion and allowing Kentucky consumers to have spirits, wine or beer shipped directly to them. Lawmakers are hoping to vote on the budget next week. The virus-relief bill has several layers to it, but much of its focus is shoring up unemployment insurance relief, House Speaker David Osborne said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The number of known coronavirus cases in the state jumped by more than 500 Thursday, surpassing 2,300, with 86 deaths, the state health department said. A 17-year-old was among the latest deaths, the first in the state of someone under 18. New Orleans continued to be a major center of COVID-19 worries. But cases also were up significantly in the opposite corner of the state. Northwest Louisiana’s Caddo Parish cases increased by 22, to 115; neighboring Bossier Parish was up to 32, an increase of 25 from the day before. The higher infection numbers reflect the increase in testing. In Thursday’s figures, the number tested rose nearly 6,600, to 18,000. “We won’t see the impact of the distancing and the closing of schools and people staying home for a couple of weeks. … We are not near the peak of this yet,” said Dr. Catherine O’Neal, an infectious disease expert and chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state announced Thursday that it would provide additional payments to support nursing facilities that are working on infection control and visitor screening amid the rise in coronavirus cases. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the move is important because of the threat coronavirus presents to older residents. Meanwhile, Acadia National Park is effectively shutting down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Park officials announced the closing of the carriage trails, Park Loop Road, campgrounds, visitor centers, visitor services and all restrooms until further notice. The only remaining park services will be those that support protection of the natural resources. Park officials said the move complies with state and local orders aimed at preventing gatherings and promoting social distancing. David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, called it “prudent action.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Maryland Board of Elections is planning to do away with polling stations for the state’s already delayed primary. Voters would instead be required to mail in or drop off their ballots in an effort to limit coronavirus infections. If approved, the move would eliminate any need for Maryland’s more than 4 million registered voters to cast their ballots in person June 2, according to a draft presented by elections officials at their Wednesday meeting, held by teleconference. The board, citing advice from health officials, said it could not guarantee poll workers the gear necessary to protect them against exposure to this coronavirus, The Baltimore Sun reports. The state’s primary was originally scheduled for April 28. Gov. Larry Hogan postponed it by executive order March 17.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s highest court will hear arguments over the telephone next Tuesday in a case seeking the release of inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic. An emergency petition filed by public defenders and defense attorneys in the Supreme Judicial Court this week asks the justices to reduce the number of people entering jails and prisons, order the release of certain pretrial detainees, and free those serving sentences who are nearing the end of their term, who are vulnerable to COVID-19 or who don’t pose a threat to the public. Several district attorneys in Massachusetts have already agreed to release certain inmates in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus behind bars. Meanwhile, a second member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation has experienced symptoms of COVID-19. U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley sought medical treatment after experiencing flu-like symptoms and has been tested for the virus, according to a statement from her spokesperson. U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton said Wednesday he decided to self-quarantine after experiencing symptoms.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday again pleaded with Michigan residents to stay at home to rein in the coronavirus, while the state’s chief medical executive said hospitals with empty beds were stepping up to ease the burden on overwhelmed medical centers. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said hospitals in southeastern Michigan, where the coronavirus cases are most numerous, are “at or near capacity.” She said some hospitals outside the region were willing to set aside 10% of their bed capacity to help out. The head of Beaumont Health, which has been swamped, raised the issue with Whitmer this week. Khaldun said Michigan is “probably a few weeks out” from hitting a peak in coronavirus cases. The state reported nearly 2,900 cases by Thursday and 60 deaths. Henry Ford Health System said it had nearly 400 coronavirus-related patients at five hospitals Thursday morning, although the numbers can swiftly change.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Legislature passed a $330 million financial aid package Thursday to help soften the economic impact and help public agencies and the state’s health system kick into high gear to fight the coronavirus pandemic that has sickened more than 300 people and killed two in the state. The Minnesota Department of Health said Thursday that the state’s second COVID-19 death was a patient from Ramsey County who, like the first fatal case, was in their 80s. The state’s count of confirmed cases jumped Thursday to 346, up 59 from a day earlier, with 44 patients hospitalized and 18 in intensive care. Their ages range from 5 months to 104 years. The House passed the bill 99-4 and sent it to the Senate, which approved it 67-0 and sent it to Gov, Tim Walz for his signature. The bill was assembled via private conference calls to keep lawmakers from risking catching the disease, and the various proposals were rolled into one big bill to limit the number of votes that must be taken.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Wednesday that he is rejecting “dictator models like China” to strictly control people’s movements to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. “We’re following our experts and I’ve spent many sleepless nights praying for wisdom in this unprecedented time,” Republican Reeves said on his Facebook and Twitter accounts. His comments came a day after he issued an executive order that seeks to limit people’s physical interactions. Reeves told restaurants and bars statewide to close their dining rooms and limit service to carry-out or deliver meals. He has encouraged people to remain home but has not issued a stay-at-home order, as many other governors have done. Also Wednesday, a day after Reeves said he wants Mississippi’s only abortion clinic to stop doing elective surgeries, the clinic was still seeing patients. Protesters and clinic escorts sometimes stood close to each other on the sidewalk outside, ignoring suggestions by medical professionals that people keep a 6-foot distance between themselves and others.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state will waive some requirements for receiving unemployment benefits as it tries to respond to a steep increase in claims during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials said. In the past week, the number of claims was about 30% of the total the state received in all of last year, said Anna Hui, director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. “That’s an incredible number,” Hui said. Missouri will temporarily waive its one-week waiting period and a requirement that people seeking unemployment make at least three attempts to find work each week, the state said. The announcement came as Missouri health officials said Wednesday that the state has confirmed 356 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 101 since Tuesday. Eight people have died from the virus.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Counties and school districts will be able to conduct elections by mail and expand early voting for the June 2 primary elections and school elections this spring, Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday. Bullock signed a directive that aims to allow the elections to proceed without risking the health and safety of voters and poll workers amid the coronavirus outbreak. The governor’s order allows – but doesn’t require – counties to conduct primary elections by mail. Ballots would be available starting May 4. A postage stamp would not be required to mail a ballot. The governor’s order gives school districts additional time to plan for all-mail elections on school issues. In-person voting would still be allowed, and polling places would be required to enforce at least 6 feet of separation between two people. Counties also are encouraged to explore drive-up options for registration and voting, according to the order.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s initial claims for unemployment benefits skyrocketed with the nation’s last week amid the coronavirus pandemic, rising to nearly 16,000 from a little less than 800 the week before, according to a federal report released Thursday. The dire financial news came as two more COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Nebraska, bringing the state total to 68, state officials said. The announcement Wednesday night follows the Legislature’s approval of an $83.6 million emergency relief package. Gov. Pete Ricketts signed the bill that will provide money for additional medical and cleaning supplies, tests and overtime for state health care workers. The governor also added Lancaster, Dodge and Saunders counties to the list of places where restaurants and bars will have to close their dining rooms because of the health risk. Similar restrictions were already in place for Douglas, Sarpy, Cass and Washington counties. Combined, all of those counties account for more than 1.1 million people and well over half of the state’s population.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The coronavirus has now claimed 10 lives in the state, including the first death of a person under the age of 50. The four deaths the state confirmed Thursday are the most in a single day since the first was reported March 16. The toll now includes a man from Clark County in his 30s with underlying medical conditions, according to the Southern Nevada Health District. The new deaths also include the first in Nevada of a victim who had no known underlying medical conditions – a man in his 60s. The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services has now confirmed 420 positive cases of coronavirus statewide. All 10 deaths have occurred in the Las Vegas area. The four new deaths equal the most in a two-day stretch since two each were reported on consecutive days on Monday and Tuesday of this week. None was reported Wednesday. The states says it has now tested more than 5,100 individuals in Nevada for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Congressional Democrats from the state are criticizing delays in getting medical supplies. The delegation called out federal health and emergency management agencies for delays in receiving medical supplies – some of which had already expired – to help the state deal with the coronavirus. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas said it is their understanding that one supervisory error at the Federal Emergency Management Agency resulted in a request sitting unprocessed for four days. When New Hampshire received supplies, some of it was expired, and the 16,000-plus gloves that were sent were latex, “which are unusable in the medical setting due to latex allergies,” according to the letter sent Wednesday to the heads of FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The delegation said between this shipment and a prior one this month, the agencies have provided only 28% of respirator masks requested, one-third of nasal swabs needed, about 26% of surgical masks and no ventilators. “Health care providers from across New Hampshire are exasperated by this piecemeal approach, which has not afforded them the supplies they need,” the delegation wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New claims for unemployment soared last week, an indication of how deeply shutdowns related to the coronavirus are cutting into the workforce and the economy. And the Catholic Archdiocese of Newark has issued new guidelines banning weddings, funerals and most baptisms. The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development said Thursday that it received 155,815 new claims for unemployment insurance for the week ending March 21. That’s a 1,546% increase over the prior week. State officials said it is the largest spike they can recall. Initial claims exceeded 46,000 in a single week after Superstorm Sandy in November 2012 and shot up to 25,385 for a week in July 2010, the low point of the last recession. New Jersey has temporarily suspended a requirement that applicants look for other jobs. It also created a jobs portal – jobs.covid19.nj.gov – to match those who are looking for work with immediate openings in industries fighting the pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRio Rancho: More than 17,000 state residents have applied for unemployment benefits – more than 19 times the amount filed the previous week – amid the widespread economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The surge in applications in one of the poorest states in the U.S. was a striking indication of the economic damage the COVID-19 outbreak is inflicting. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, New Mexico saw 17,187 people apply for unemployment benefits last week, compared to 869 people the week before. The latest numbers come as oil and gas prices continue to fall – hurting one of New Mexico’s most robust industries – and as state officials imposed new restrictions on nonessential businesses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Across the state with the highest percentage of Hispanic residents in the country, historic plazas sit empty, restaurants have closed, popular breweries have shuttered, and movie productions have halted. Tourism, one of the state’s strong points in recent years, also has taken a hit. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” state Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley said. “But these efforts are being made to save people’s lives.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak will be dramatic in New York and castigated federal officials for what he called a failure to address lost revenue in their $2.2 trillion relief package. “The congressional action, in my opinion, simply failed to address the governmental need,” he said Thursday. “I find it irresponsible. I find it reckless.” Cuomo said the outbreak creates a “double whammy” of increased state costs and lost revenue as businesses shutter and workers are laid off. Meanwhile, the state’s death toll from the coronavirus jumped by 100 in one day, pushing the number to 385, Cuomo said Thursday. He added that experts expect the number to increase as critically ill patients who have been on ventilators for several days succumb to the virus. “That is a situation where people just deteriorate over time,” Cuomo said. He said at least 122,000 people in the state have been tested for the virus, and there have been more than 37,200 confirmed cases. He said more than 5,300 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized statewide as of Thursday, with nearly 1,300 of them in intensive care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state can now receive additional emergency assistance after Gov. Roy Cooper’s request for a major disaster area declaration due to COVID-19 has been approved by the federal government. The White House announced President Donald Trump’s decision late Wednesday on the declaration, which commonly has been sought by North Carolina after hurricanes. Cooper issued a state of emergency in North Carolina on March 10, and Trump followed with a national emergency declaration a few days later. The state now counts more than 630 positive COVID-cases as of Thursday morning, or about 130 more than Wednesday. Health officials announced two deaths – one a person from Cabarrus County and another person from Virginia who contracted the virus while in North Carolina. Nearly 13,000 tests have been completed statewide.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State health officials on Thursday reported seven new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including one boy from McIntosh County under the age of 10. The other cases include three people in their 20s, one in their 30s and two in their 80s. Two of the patients were hospitalized, raising the total number of people in medical facilities to 10. It’s not clear how the child contracted the virus. The state has tested 2,091 people, 52 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19. There have been 136 people tested since Wednesday afternoon. Gov. Doug Burgum said Wednesday that he has formed a testing task force that includes private entities, with hopes of doubling the number of daily assessments. Burgum said the numbers “are still climbing” and will increase with the amount of testing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is poised to sign a sweeping relief package passed by lawmakers to address impacts of the coronavirus, while new figures on jobless claims show those numbers skyrocketing. Ohio has more than 700 cases of the virus, including three confirmed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which has set up a coronavirus command center. The state’s 700-plus coronavirus cases include 116 health care workers and 10 deaths. A handful of long-term care centers are being called hot spots for cases. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base declared a public health emergency and set up a command center. Three cases have been confirmed there. Unit commanders have been given latitude to let employees work from home if they’re able, the Dayton Daily News reports. The state is limiting testing to those who are hospitalized and to health care workers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of coronavirus deaths in the state rose from five to seven Thursday as the number of cases increased from 164 to at least 248, including a member of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Cabinet. The State Department of Health reported two additional deaths in Cleveland County, a woman in her 90s and a man in his 60s, bringing to three the number who have died there. Two previous deaths were reported in Oklahoma County and one each in Tulsa and Pawnee counties. State Secretary of Digital Transformation and Administration David Ostrowe is among the cases and is quarantined and recovering at home, said Baylee Lakey, a spokeswoman for the governor. Ostrowe has not had contact with Stitt in more than two weeks, Lakey said, and Stitt hasn’t been tested and has no plans to do so at this time. Any staff that may have had contact with Ostrowe were asked to quarantine themselves for 14 days, Lakey said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: People concerned about a cough or fever can soon call an Oregon Health & Science University COVID-19 hotline that doctors hope will help people figure out what’s going on and reduce the burden on health care workers. A $1.6 million donation will help launch the COVID-19 hotline by covering the costs of dedicated phone lines and computers, as well as training for hotline staff, OHSU spokeswoman Amanda Gibbs told the Oregonian/OregonLive. The donation came from the Andrew and Corey Morris-Singer Foundation. Gibbs said patients who call the hospital will have the option to be routed directly to the new hotline, which will be staffed by medical professionals who will triage the concerns of callers who think they may be sick with the virus. Gibbs said hospital administrators don’t yet know exactly when the service will start, but it will eventually be made available to most of OHSU’s clinics for at least the next three months. She said OHSU is looking into extending the service to text and email.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBethlehem: No more Peeps are being hatched for at least a couple of weeks – but it shouldn’t affect Easter baskets. The Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based Just Born confections company said its production facilities there and in Philadelphia closed Wednesday through April 7. But the company says it had already produced and shipped the Easter supply of its signature marshmallow confection to outlets. Just Born says the popular Peeps & Company retail store in Center Valley, Pennsylvania, is also closed for now. The store is billed as a Peeps “experience” and features light displays, historical videos and merchandise. The company also makes other candies, including Mike and Ikes and Goldenberg’s Peanut Chews. Just Born officials say that inventories of those candies had been shipped prior to the production stoppage, but they might be in short supply at some retailers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers on Thursday approved as much as $300 million in emergency borrowing to help the state pay its bills with the economy virtually shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Gina Raimondo told House and Senate leaders the extraordinary measure is needed because the Internal Revenue Service has pushed back the federal income tax filing deadline to July 15, obligating the state to delay its tax collections as well. Other state officials said Rhode Island could run out of money by next week. They also stressed the cash infusion will not be used to create new programs and services that haven’t been approved by lawmakers. “We’re facing a liquidity problem. We don’t have what we need,” Raimondo said in a rare meeting of the Disaster Emergency Funding Board, composed of the House speaker, Senate president and the finance committee chairs in each chamber. “We have to keep the lights on to help keep Rhode Islanders alive.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: In the first week of economic disruption from the coronavirus, more than 31,000 people said they lost their jobs in the state. South Carolina on Thursday released unemployment claims for the week ending March 21, and the 31,054 claims were almost the same number of jobless claims filed over the first 11 weeks of 2020 combined, including a big spike after the temporary jobs created around Christmas. The sharpest increases in claims last week came from Horry County and Charleston County, where the closing of bars and restaurants and the sharp decline in tourism hurt the most. More than 420 COVID-19 cases have been reported in South Carolina with seven deaths, the state Department of Health and Environmental Control said in its daily update Wednesday. Health officials also released their first predictions on the virus’s spread Wednesday, suggesting the state could have more than 2,650 cases by April 2 and more than 8,050 cases by May 2, DHEC said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHuron: As the state grappled with the reality of COVID-19’s spread, the city of Huron emerged as the state’s early hotbed of the pandemic, prompting fear and a resolve to preserve scarce medical resources. Huron, known for its meat-packing plant and as the site of the state fair, could not feel more distant from early epicenters of COVID-19 elsewhere in the United States, such as New York City or Seattle. But as Gov. Kristi Noem warns that up to 30% of people in the state could become infected, the community has revealed what many are about to face – anxiety prompted by an invisible foe and the makeshift response required to endure the pandemic. Huron was one of the first places in South Dakota with community spread – when it’s unclear how an infected person contracted the virus.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is producing a series of public service announcements designed to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The campaign has the tagline “Do your part, stay apart,” and features Gov. Bill Lee and first lady Maria Lee plus other prominent Tennesseans. Brad Paisley, University of Memphis basketball coach Penny Hardaway, former NFL Titan Eddie George, University of Tennessee athletics director Phil Fulmer, Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael W. Smith and Cece Winans are among the dozens of music artists, athletes and sports organizations participating in the campaign via social media, according to a news release. Collectively, they reach millions of Tennesseans through their social media platforms. The campaign will begin on social media and then be broadcast by Charter Communications and Comcast and promoted on billboards through Outdoor Advertising Association Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dallas County officials say five jail inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus. Dallas County Sheriff Marian Brown announced Wednesday that an inmate in his 40s tested positive and that four others who were in his pod had symptoms. Later Wednesday, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said those four inmates also tested positive. The initial positive test on the first inmate came back early Wednesday morning. Brown said he’d been housed in a shared pod with about 50 other inmates and had been in the jail since December. She said health officials were working to determine how he contracted the virus. Brown had said that the four inmates who showed symptoms had been quarantined, as had those in the pod who weren’t showing symptoms. Across Texas, about 1,400 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, along with 18 deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is suspending all temple activity due to concerns about the coronavirus. The Utah-based faith said Wednesday that the temporary suspension would start at the end of the day, said Irene Caso, a church spokeswoman. The church said the decision was made after careful consideration and “with a desire to be responsible global citizens.” Meanwhile, hard-hit Summit County is telling residents to stay home except for essential errands and asking visitors to the ski-resort community of Park City to stay away. The shelter-in-place order issued Wednesday is the first such declaration in the state. The county has been a hotspot for cases statewide and now has a similar number of cases per capita as hard-hit New York City and parts of Italy, said Summit County Health Director Rich Bullough. The order starts Friday and will be in place at least until May 1. Visitors planning new trips to Park City are being asked not to come, as well as those with second homes in the area.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont is poised to receive almost $2 billion in support from the nearly $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that is making its way through Congress, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said. The legislation, which passed the Senate on Wednesday and is expected to pass the House on Friday, includes $1.25 billion to support the state and counties that are addressing the economic devastation caused by the virus. Among other appropriations for Vermont, the bill will provide $20 million to support public transportation, $5.4 million to support public health preparedness and $4.7 million in community development block grants. “Vermont is already reeling from the impacts of the spread of the coronavirus,” Leahy said in a news release late Wednesday. “I have heard from hundreds of small businesses and entities across the state, struggling to support their employees and maintain their businesses.”\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Some churches and nonprofits in Virginia are donating their supplies to hospitals and emergency medical services to help battle the coronavirus. The Virginian-Pilot reports the supplies had been intended to provide relief in other countries but are now being donated locally. For instance, Rock Church in Virginia Beach dipped into its reserve for mission trips and gave 1,000 masks to four Sentara hospitals. Operation Smile, which focuses on cleft lip and palate surgeries across the globe, gave 1,800 masks and 4,500 gloves to Sentara Princess Anne Hospital. Meanwhile, Gov. Ralph Northam has made a plea for businesses to step up and help out as well. He said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management shipped a major supply of protective equipment to local health departments and hospitals over the weekend. But much more is needed. The state is expected to get a second shipment from the national stockpile next week.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two detainees with health conditions that make them vulnerable to COVID-19 have been released from an immigration jail in Tacoma, their attorneys said Thursday. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington sued March 16 on behalf of nine detainees with underlying conditions, saying they’d face special danger if the coronavirus spreads in the jail. A federal judge last week declined to immediately order their release, but after the attorneys filed another request Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released two of the seven from its Northwest detention center. Matt Adams, legal director of the Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s not clear why those two were released while the others remain in custody. ICE did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The nursing home described as the epicenter of the state’s coronavirus caseload now has 28 positive cases as containment measures continue, officials said Thursday. Sundale nursing home medical director Carl Shrader said 20 residents and eight staffers at the Morgantown facility have the virus, with four tests pending after an aggressive effort to screen nearly everyone at the center. “What’s on all our minds is containing it where we have it and not letting it rage on if possible,” he said. Shrader has described Sundale as “ground zero” for the virus in West Virginia. State officials reported at least 51 positive cases as of Wednesday night, with the largest number in Monongalia County, where the nursing home is located. Testing remains limited, meaning most people now spreading the highly contagious virus may not know they have been infected, and state health officials have admitted their count lags behind the actual total as results pour in from counties around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican National Committee and the state Republican Party have asked a federal judge to let them officially oppose a lawsuit brought by Democrats who want to ease voting regulations for Wisconsin’s spring election because of the coronavirus. The Republicans’ motion argues that they should be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit to protect their constituents from last-minute changes in voting laws and procedures. They argue that they would be forced to spend substantial resources informing Republican voters of the changes and combating “inevitable confusion.” “While all political parties want what’s best for the public, the reality is that they have very different ideas of what that looks like and how best to accomplish it,” the motion said. The lawsuit asks Conley to give people until April 3, the Friday before the election, to register online or by mail. The window for remote registration closed March 18.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Restrictions on public gathering and businesses to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus will be in effect longer than planned, the governor suggested Wednesday. Through April 3, Gov. Mark Gordon has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people at a time and shut down a range of businesses, from museums to tattoo shops. “This isn’t a situation that will run its course by the first week of April. We all know that,” Gordon said at a news conference. Protecting the health of medical professionals and other front-line emergency workers will be especially important to help keep Wyoming’s medical system from becoming overwhelmed by the COVID-19 virus, Gordon said. Residents should work from home if at all possible, Gordon said, and avoid making 911 calls and trips to hospital emergency rooms if they are not truly necessary. Wyoming has become one of a minority of states without a statewide or local stay-at-home order. Gordon said he hoped to avoid one.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/27"}]}

In some cases, those efforts could lead to lower supplies in other parts of the country, such as Florida. Experts warn that drivers should not panic because rushing to top off tanks could make the problem worse.\n\nRelated:\n\nHurricane Harvey pushes gas prices near two-year high\n\nThe nation's largest oil refinery shuts down as Hurricane Harvey floods Texas\n\nHarvey may have wrecked up to 1M cars and trucks\n\nTropical Depression Harvey batters Texas\n\n\"There are certainly shortages occurring in retail stations in certain markets, however a lot of that is being driven by consumer behavior — panic buying,\" said Rob Smith, director of IHS Energy's downstream practice.\n\nGas prices continued to spike nationwide amid the disruption, reaching two-year highs of $2.52 a gallon on Friday as the country headed into the long Labor Day weekend, according to AAA.\n\nNational retail prices could reach as high as $2.75 in the coming days after wholesale prices, a leading indicator, jumped sharply, according to independent projections Friday by GasBuddy.com petroleum analyst Patrick DeHaan and Oil Price Information Service analyst Tom Kloza.\n\nEven so, prices remain well below the record of $4.114 from July 2008, AAA data show.\n\nAlthough the U.S. had some 230 million barrels of gasoline in storage as of Friday —ample supply in a crisis — transporting fuel from storage terminals to stations has been extremely challenging.\n\nThat's because several key ports along the Texas Gulf Coast were closed for most of the week, the critical Houston Shipping Channel was shuttered for several days and many local roadways have been unpassable.\n\nWhat's more, the vital Colonial Pipeline, a critical source of energy transportation from Houston to the Southeast, has been operating at reduced capacity.\n\nTo resupply the Texas market with gasoline, one company, Magellan Midstream Partners, reversed a portion of a pipeline that typically transports gasoline and diesel fuel from Dallas to Tulsa, Okla.\n\nSuppliers on the Louisiana Gulf Coast are now sending energy to areas hit hard by Harvey instead of to Florida, which is now getting gasoline on barges from the New York region.\n\n\"Gasoline is coming, but instead of being a spigot it’s more of a trickle,\" DeHaan said. \"But over time the trickle will slowly start to increase.\"\n\nKloza urged consumers not to rush to the pump unless they are low on fuel.\n\n\"There’s always folks that are yelling fire in a crowded theater, and panic can ensue — and to a certain extent there was tank-topping and desperation buying in Texas,\" he said.\n\nWith the temporary redistribution of energy to aid the Gulf Coast, other markets could face shortages if buyers panic, analysts said.\n\nKloza said that Florida, Tennessee and possibly mid-Atlantic states could be at risk of tight supplies.\n\n\"Even if people are just topping off their tanks — if everyone's doing it or a large chunk of people are doing it, that really puts a short-term spike in demand and the system really can’t handle that,\" IHS Energy's Smith said.\n\nThe good news for motorists is that multiple refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast are already aiming to reopen.\n\nBut that could take several days or weeks, and prices will get higher before they pull back. The average price on Friday was up 17 cents from a week ago and 30 cents from a year ago, AAA says.\n\nIn some gas stations in East Austin, Texas, the price of regular gasoline jumped 20 cents a gallon overnight as cars lined up to get gas.\n\nMultiple stations across the Dallas/Fort Worth area also shut down after running out of fuel.\n\nContributing: Rick Jervis\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/politics/white-house-lobby-opec-oil-production-cuts-gasoline-prices-midterms/index.html", "title": "Inside the White House's failed effort to dissuade OPEC from cutting ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration launched a full-scale pressure campaign in a last-ditch effort to dissuade Middle Eastern allies from dramatically cutting oil production, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBut that effort appears to have failed, following Wednesday’s crucial meeting of OPEC+, the international cartel of oil producers that, as expected, announced a significant cut to output in an effort to raise oil prices. That in turn will likely cause US gasoline prices to rise at a precarious time for the Biden administration, just five weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, OPEC+ oil ministers meeting in Vienna agreed to an even larger production cut than the White House had feared — 2 million barrels per day, beginning in November, according to a readout of the meeting released on Wednesday. The ministers said the cuts were necessary “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden told CNN’s Arlette Saenz on Wednesday that he was “concerned” about the cuts, which he viewed as “unnecessary.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters when asked about the move that “when it comes to OPEC, we’ve made clear our views to the OPEC members.”\n\nFor the past several days, Biden’s senior-most energy, economic and foreign policy officials were enlisted to lobby their foreign counterparts in Middle Eastern allied countries including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to vote against cutting oil production. Wednesday’s production cut amounts to the largest cut since the beginning of the pandemic and could lead to a dramatic spike in oil prices.\n\nSome of the draft talking points circulated by the White House to the Treasury Department on Monday that were obtained by CNN framed the prospect of a production cut as a “total disaster” and warned that it could be taken as a “hostile act.”\n\n“It’s important everyone is aware of just how high the stakes are,” said a US official of what was framed as a broad administration effort that is expected to continue in the lead up to the Wednesday OPEC+ meeting.\n\nThe White House is “having a spasm and panicking,” another US official said, describing this latest administration effort as “taking the gloves off.” According to a White House official, the talking points were being drafted and exchanged by staffers and not approved by White House leadership or used with foreign partners.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said, “We’ve been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for consumers around the world and we will continue to talk with our partners about that.”\n\nFor Biden, a dramatic cut in oil production could not come at a worse time. The administration has for months engaged in an intensive domestic and foreign policy effort to mitigate soaring energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That work appeared to pay off, with US gasoline prices falling for almost 100 days in a row.\n\nBut with just a month to go before the critical midterm elections, US gasoline prices have begun to creep up again, posing a political risk the White House is desperately trying to avoid. As US officials have moved to gauge potential domestic options to head off gradual increases over the last several weeks, the news of major OPEC+ action presents a particularly acute challenge.\n\nWatson, the NSC spokesperson declined to comment on the midterms, saying instead, “Thanks to the President’s efforts, energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump.”\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nAmos Hochstein, Biden’s top energy envoy, played a leading role in the lobbying effort, which has been far more extensive than previously reported amid extreme concern in the White House over the potential cut. Hochstein, along with top national security official Brett McGurk and the administration’s special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking, traveled to Jeddah late last month to discuss a range of energy and security issues as a follow up to Biden’s high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia in July.\n\nFrom left to right, Amos Hochstein, Janet Yellen and Brett McGurk Handout/Anadolu Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOfficials across the administration’s economic and foreign policy teams were also been involved with reaching out to OPEC governments as part of the latest effort to stave off a production cut.\n\nThe White House asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to make the case personally to some Gulf state finance ministers, including from Kuwait and the UAE, and try to convince them that a production cut would be extremely damaging to the global economy. The US has argued that in the long-run a cut in oil production would create more downward pressure on prices – the opposite of what a significant cut would be designed to accomplish. Their logic is that “cutting right now would increase risks of inflation,” lead to higher interest rates and ultimately a greater risk of recession.\n\n“There is great political risk to your reputation and relations with the United States and the west if you move forward,” the White House draft talking points suggested Yellen communicate to her foreign counterparts.\n\nA senior US official acknowledged that the administration lobbied the Saudi-led coalition for weeks to try to convince them not to cut oil production.\n\nEfforts to court Saudi Arabia\n\nWednesday’s production cut comes less than three months after President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a trip that was driven in part by a desire to convince Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, to increase oil production which would help bring down the then-skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n\nBiden's meeting with Saudi crown prince comes under fire 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nWhen OPEC+ agreed a few weeks later to a modest 100,000 barrel increase in production, critics argued Biden had gotten little in return.\n\nThe trip was billed as a meeting with regional leaders about issues critical to US national security, including Iran, Israel and Yemen. It was criticized for its lack of results and for rehabbing the image of the crown prince who had been directly blamed by Biden for orchestrating the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn the months leading up to the meeting, Biden’s top aides for the Middle East and energy, McGurk and Hochstein, shuttled between Washington and Saudi Arabia planning and coordinating the visit.\n\nOne diplomatic official in the region described the US campaign to block production cuts as less of a hard sell, and more of an effort to underscore a critical international moment given the economic fragility and ongoing war in Ukraine. Though another source familiar with the discussions told CNN it was described by a diplomat from one of the countries approached as “desperate.”\n\nA source familiar with the outreach says a call was planned with the UAE but the effort was rebuffed by Kuwait. Kuwait’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Saudi Arabia’s. The UAE embassy declined to comment.\n\nPublicly, the White House has cautiously avoided weighing in on the possibility of a dramatic oil production cut.\n\n“We are not members of OPEC+, and so I don’t want to get ahead of what could potentially come out of that meeting,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday. The US focus, Jean-Pierre said, remains “taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy.”\n\nOPEC’s effort to boost prices\n\nOPEC+ members are weighing a more dramatic cut due to what has been a precipitous decline in prices, which have dropped sharply to below $90 per barrel in recent months.\n\nHanging over Wednesday’s OPEC+ meeting in Vienna will also be the looming oil price cap that European nations intend to impose on Russian oil exports as punishment for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many OPEC+ members, not only Russia, have expressed unhappiness with the prospect of a price cap because of the precedent it could set for consumers, rather than the market, to dictate the price of oil.\n\nIncluded in the White House talking points to Treasury was a US proposal that if OPEC+ decides against a cut this week the US will announce a buyback of up to 200 million barrels to refill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), an emergency stockpile of petroleum that the US has been tapping into this year to help lower oil prices.\n\nThe administration has made it clear to OPEC+ for months, the senior US official said, that the US is willing to buy OPEC’s oil to replenish the SPR. The idea has been to convey to OPEC+ that the US “won’t leave them hanging dry” if they invest money in production, the official said, and therefore, that prices won’t collapse if global demand decreases.", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt Natasha Bertrand Phil Mattingly", "Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/10/20/fact-check-bidens-america-grocery-store-image-taken-2018/8521707002/", "title": "Fact check: 'Bidens America' grocery store image was taken in 2018", "text": "The claim: Images show grocery shelves taken during Biden and Trump presidencies\n\nGrocery stores across the nation are facing challenges stocking limited quantities of products due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and a shortage of employees along with shipping congestion at the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nAs supply chain issues are expected to worsen and grocers place limits on the purchase of certain items, some people have taken to Twitter to criticize President Joe Biden with the hashtag #BareShelvesBiden.\n\nMeanwhile, some social media users have used an outdated image captured outside of the U.S., asserting that the scenes depict current situations at grocery stores.\n\nAn Oct. 12 Facebook post with more than 78,000 shares juxtaposes two photos: One of empty grocery store shelves presented as “Bidens America” and one of fully stocked shelves labeled \"Trumps America.\"\n\nBut the images included in the post are unrelated to the global supply chain crisis.\n\nFact check: California trucking regulations aren't to blame for cargo backlog\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not return a request for comment.\n\nPhotos are misleading\n\nWhile certain products remain scarce at grocery stores, the photo of “Trumps America” was actually captured in 2012, and the image of “Bidens America” is from 2018, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe top image shows fully stocked grocery shelves at a Coles Supermarket at Westfield Southland Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia, according to the photo’s caption.

Now it’s the site of one of the country’s worst disasters.\n\nOn Saturday night, tens of thousands of people flooded into the area in central Seoul to celebrate Halloween – but panic erupted as the crowds swelled, with some witnesses saying it became hard to breathe and impossible to move.\n\nThrough Sunday, the number of dead climbed to 154, with dozens more injured. Authorities have now launched an urgent investigation to find out how what was supposed to be a night of celebration went so horribly wrong, as families across the country mourn and search for missing loved ones.\n\nHere’s what we know so far.\n\nRescue teams work at the scene in Seoul, South Korea, where people were injured in a crowd surge during a Halloween festival.

Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images In pictures: Seoul Halloween crowd surge Prev Next\n\nWhy were the crowds so big?\n\nItaewon has long been a popular place to celebrate Halloween, especially as the holiday became more popular in Asia in recent years. Some even fly into Seoul from other countries in the region for the festivities.\n\nBut for the past two years, celebrations were muted by pandemic restrictions on crowd sizes and mask mandates.\n\nSaturday night marked the first Halloween since the country lifted these restrictions – lending it particular significance for many eager participants in Seoul, as well as international visitors including foreign residents and tourists.\n\nHotels and ticketed events in the neighborhood had been booked solid in advance, and large crowds were expected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nCNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster. See what's it like 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nCrowds are not unusual for that area, or for Seoul residents, who are used to jam-packed subways and streets in a city of almost 10 million.\n\nOne eyewitness said it took some time for people to realize something was wrong, with people’s panicked screams competing with music blaring from the surrounding clubs and bars.\n\nOnlookers, police and paramedics gather in the popular nightlife district of Itaewon in Seoul on October 30, 2022. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the first emergency calls came in around 10:24 p.m., authorities rushed to the scene – but the sheer volume of people made it difficult to reach those who needed help.\n\nVideo posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical assistance.\n\nThe thousands of people in Halloween costumes contributed to the widespread sense of confusion and chaos. One witness described seeing a police officer shouting during the disaster – but some revelers mistook him for another partygoer.\n\nThe cause of the crush is still under investigation, though officials said there were no gas leaks or fires on site.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe casualties were young, mostly in their teens and early 20s, authorities said. Known for its nightlife and trendy restaurants, Itaewon is popular among backpackers and international students.\n\nAmong the 154 dead were at least 26 foreign nationals, according to authorities, with victims from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAll but one of the victims have been identified, South Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a briefing on Monday. The toll included 56 men and 97 women, South Korea’s Interior and Safety Ministry reported.\n\nSurvivors recount horror of Halloween disaster in Seoul 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Education said Monday that six school students were among the dead, including one in middle school. Three teachers also died.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. local time Sunday (4 a.m. ET), the number of injured had risen to 133, of whom 37 were seriously injured, the ministry said.\n\nThe Seoul city government said more than 4,000 missing people reports had been received. That number could include multiple reports for the same person, or reports filed Saturday night for people who have since been found.\n\nPolice said there is no active search for those reported missing as they believe no one went missing from the scene; rather, they said the missing person reports have been used to help identify those who died.\n\nEmergency services treat injured people in Seoul on October 30. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nWhat was the official response?\n\nLee Sang-min, Minister of the Interior and Safety, said on Sunday that “a considerable number” of police and security forces had been sent to another part of Seoul on Saturday in response to expected protests there.\n\nMeanwhile in Itaewon, the crowd had not been unusually large, he said, so only a “normal” level of security forces had been deployed there.\n\nAs the disaster unfolded Saturday night, more than 1,700 emergency response forces were dispatched, including more than 500 firefighters, 1,100 police officials, and about 70 government workers.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol called an emergency meeting and urged officials to identify the dead as soon as possible.\n\nBut even hours later, families were still waiting to find out if their loved ones survived.\n\nRelatives of missing people weep at a community service center on October 30 in Seoul, South Korea. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many people were transferred to nearby facilities, while bodies were taken to multiple hospital mortuaries. Families gathered at sites near the scene, where officials were compiling the names of the missing and deceased.\n\nYoon promised to implement new measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, saying the government would “conduct emergency inspections not only for Halloween events but also for local festivals and thoroughly manage them so they are conducted in an orderly and safe manner.”\n\nThe government will also provide psychological treatment and a fund for families of the deceased and injured. Authorities have declared a national mourning period until November 5, and designated the district of Yongsan-gu, where Itaewon is located, a special disaster area.\n\nFlowers are seen at the scene of a deadly accident in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nQuestions being asked\n\nAs a stunned and grieving nation grapples with the tragedy, questions are also emerging about how such a disaster could have unfolded in a popular area where people are known to gather.\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint what might have triggered the crush – but authorities “would have anticipated high numbers … before Saturday night,” said Juliette Kayyem, a disaster management expert and national security analyst for CNN.\n\n“There is a responsibility on the part of the authorities to be monitoring crowd volume in real time, so they can sense the need to get people out,” she added.\n\nSuah Cho, 23, was caught up in the crowd but managed to escape into a building along the alley. When asked whether she had seen any officials trying to limit the number of people entering the alley, she replied: “Before the incident, not at all.”\n\nAnother eyewitness described the situation getting “worse and worse,” saying they could hear “people asking for help for other people, because there were not enough rescuers that can just handle all that.”", "authors": ["Sophie Jeong Gawon Bae Paula Hancocks Hilary Whiteman Jessie Yeung", "Sophie Jeong", "Gawon Bae", "Paula Hancocks", "Hilary Whiteman", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2022/01/12/shortage-grocery-store-empty-shelves/9178100002/", "title": "Grocery stores empty shelves 2022: Shortages continue as prices rise", "text": "The new year hasn't stopped ongoing food shortages.\n\nShortages at grocery stores across the country have grown more acute in recent weeks as omicron continues to spread and winter storms have piled on to the supply chain struggles and labor shortages.\n\nThe shortages being reported nationwide are widespread, impacting produce and meat as well as packaged goods such as cereal.\n\nWhile items are harder to find, many also cost more with rising inflation.\n\nThe consumer price index jumped 7% last year, the fastest pace since 1982, the Labor Department said Wednesday.

Americans are eating at home more than they used to, especially since offices and some schools remain closed.\n\nWeather-related events, from snowstorms in the Northeast to wildfires in Colorado, also have impacted product availability and caused some shoppers to stock up more than usual, exacerbating supply problems caused by the pandemic.\n\nU.S. groceries typically have 5% to 10% of their items out of stock at any given time; right now, that unavailability rate is hovering around 15%, according to Consumer Brands Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman.\n\n►New Oreo flavor:Oreo releasing a limited-edition Chocolate Confetti Cake Cookie for its 110th birthday\n\n►Lettuce recall 2022:Dole recalls salad sold at Walmart, Kroger, Aldi, H-E-B for listeria risk\n\nPatrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, recently told USA TODAY that cream cheese and international foods were among the food products in short supply.\n\n“As you walk through a lot of stores you won’t see the quantity and quality of items you are accustomed to seeing,” Penfield said, adding some shortages are regional due to labor and truck shortages.\n\nIn a recent study by business consultancy KPMG, 71% of grocery consumers said they were somewhat or very concerned about shortages or stockouts with 35% switching brands when their favorite items are out of stock.\n\nCostco limits purchases of some items\n\nSome retailers have been limiting purchases of select items, similar to policies implemented at the start of the pandemic.

Know of more? There's a form below where you can share your experiences.\n\nBaby formula shortage\n\nIn-stock levels for baby formula and baby food nationwide are slightly higher than for food products overall, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.\n\nKrishnakumar Davey, president of strategic analytics at IRI, told the Journal the shortages are intermittent and vary based on retailer and location. Davey said some of the nation’s 10 largest retailers had more than 20% of baby formula out of stock the week ended Jan. 2.\n\nSome parents have been taking to social media to ask formula makers where they can buy products.\n\n“We are experiencing obstacles in the production and shipping of some of our products as the pandemic continues to cause issues with the supply chain. We appreciate your patience as we navigate this dynamic situation,” Enfamil said on Twitter Dec. 29 in responding to one parent’s plea for help.\n\nEnfamil also said parents can see real-time product availability at stores on its website.\n\nCream cheese shortage\n\nBagel shops have been struggling with the cream cheese shortage and Junior's Cheesecake had to stop production twice at its New Jersey-based facility because it didn't have enough cream cheese.\n\nBut cream cheese has also been missing at stores, particularly Philadelphia Cream Cheese.\n\nIn December, the Kraft brand offered consumers help paying for a replacement dessert, acknowledging the ongoing supply chain disruption of the key cheesecake ingredient.\n\nAndrew Tobisch, a spokesperson for Schreiber Foods, said every cream cheese provider has struggled to keep up with demand.\n\n\"While that demand has been steady, it’s really world events that are the biggest driver. Things like the pandemic, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are all hurdles that everyone is having to overcome,\" Tobisch said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n►Meat shortage:There's a meat shortage in the U.S. right now—here are 10 meat delivery subscription boxes to shop\n\n►Blame inflation:Domino's Pizza reducing number of wings in $7.99 deal orders\n\nAluminum shortage\n\nMore consumers have opted to enjoy their favorite beverages in the comfort of their homes causing a higher demand for canned drinks. But the pandemic is only part of the problem.\n\nThe demand for can products accumulated for years according to a Quartz article. Canned drinks are cheaper to make and transport, and easier to market and design, initiating the highest prices for aluminum the market has seen in the past 10 years, senior analyst Salvator Tiano told Quartz.\n\nCat food, dog food shortages\n\nShipping woes and aluminum shortages have led to a scarcity problem for the pet food industry as stores throughout the country are unable to stock all their traditional brands and products.\n\nConsumers are also feeling the impact. Many USA TODAY readers said canned or wet cat food was one of the top items they have been struggling to find.\n\nThese shortages are impacting the movement of ingredients and finished products, the Pet Food Institute told USA TODAY. Along with labor and transportation shortages, pet owners are spending more time with their pets which can lead to increased feeding and more treating. The high demand has resulted in larger purchases.\n\nMarcie Rivera, a spokesperson for Wegmans told the MetroWest Daily News in Framingham, Massachusetts, part of the USA TODAY Network, that suppliers around the world \"are being faced with an array of challenges affecting their businesses, causing a domino effect on retailers and customers.\"\n\nChicken tender shortage\n\nChicken tenders may be the next casualty of supply-chain-generated shortages, according to a recent NBC News story. Chicken tenders require more processing and packaging, which makes them harder to find and more costly, the story said.\n\nMeat manufacturers have cited extreme weather, labor shortages and high demand among the reasons consumers are having trouble finding tenders.\n\nA spokesman for the National Chicken Council said products were taking longer than normal to get to their destinations but that does not constitute a \"shortage.\"\n\n\"There is no chicken tender shortage,\" said Tom Super, senior vice president of communications with the trade group. \"Like almost all goods right now, supplies are somewhat tight, but I would say it falls short of any 'shortage.'\"\n\n►Finger lickin' gone:Is a chicken tender shortage underway?\n\nLunchables shortage\n\nFor months, parents have reported trouble finding Kraft Heinz' Lunchables. The company told USA TODAY that it has been seeing double-digit growth for the first time in five years.\n\nHigh demand is one reason why it's harder to find these items.\n\n“Our entire supply chain continues to step up – taking actions that protect our business today, while working hard to not delay critical investments that set us up for the future,” Kraft Heinz said in the statement.\n\nToilet paper shortage\n\nIn spring 2020, demand for toilet paper skyrocketed as Americans were faced with a possibly lengthy stay-at-home future. Panic buying of bath tissue has returned at various times throughout the pandemic. This shortage stems from lumber's raw material, wood pulp, which is used to make toilet paper.\n\nChampagne shortage could impact celebrations for years\n\nThe nation is in the early stages of a Champagne shortage that is expected to last several years, according to Wine Enthusiast.\n\nDrizly, North America's largest alcohol e-commerce and on-demand delivery platform, surveyed 500 alcohol retailers and found 80% said they were at least slightly concerned about the champagne supply running short.\n\nEven with the shortages, Liz Paquette, Drizly head of consumer insights, said champagne and prosecco continue to be the top-selling sparkling wines with 63% and 18% of market share.\n\nBeer shortage\n\nHaving a hard time finding your favorite craft beer? It could be part of the aluminum shortage, but the price of ingredients for beer are also skyrocketing because of supply chain issues throughout the world.\n\nSam Hendler, co-owner of Jack’s Abby Craft Lagers in Framingham, Massachusetts, and president of the Massachusetts Brewers Guild, told MetroWest Daily News that the cost increases being felt by breweries are universal and a big topic among colleagues.\n\nIn the past, manufacturers couldn’t keep up with the demand to make cans, but now even when cans are available, getting them to breweries can be difficult.\n\nContributing: Associated Press; Paul Davidson, Naomi Ludlow, Michelle Shen and Taylor Avery, USA TODAY; Norman Miller, MetroWest Daily News\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko.

The station’s chief traffic reporter, Captain Dave Edwards, told Braasch something was happening at Three Mile Island.\n\nThere had been no official notification of what was happening, no public alarm. One of Edwards’ traffic watchers had noticed some activity around the plant, just a few miles away, near Middletown, and had heard some chatter on the police scanner about something going on at the nuclear power plant.\n\nBraasch connected Edwards with Mike Pintek, the station’s news director. Pintek said he’d check it out. He looked up a phone number for Metropolitan Edison at Three Mile Island and dialed. (Met-Ed owned and operated the plant then.) The number turned out to be the direct line into the control room for TMI’s unit 2 reactor.\n\nThe man who answered the phone told Pintek, “I can’t talk right now; we got stuff going on.”\n\nThey did.\n\nPintek was transferred to other people. He explained that the station was going to go on the air with the story. He was told that “everything was under control.”\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\nMORE:Three Mile Island shuts down Sept. 20, 2019\n\nCLOSING TMI:How to secure the nuclear plant and why it may take 60 years\n\nThe accident\n\nThe day was March 28, 1979, a date etched in the memories of those who lived through what would transpire in the following days, weeks and years, the date of the worst accident in the history of nuclear power in the United States.\n\nThe short version of events that resulted in the partial meltdown of the unit 2 reactor is that mechanical malfunctions, coupled with human error, led to the reactor being starved of coolant, leading the fuel in the reactor to begin melting.\n\nThe fear was that once the radioactive fuel began melting, nothing could contain it, and it would melt through the steel vessel housing the reactor and not stop until it hit the ground-water table, causing an explosion of radioactive steam. This was the so-called China Syndrome, a fanciful way of saying that the molten material would pass through the earth all the way to China.\n\nMore:I have vivid memories of Three Mile Island 40 years ago - and one lingering concern\n\nMore:Thyroid cancer study re-ignites debate over Three Mile Island accident’s health effects\n\nMore:Some Pa. lawmakers push for taxpayer bailout of Three Mile Island, other nuclear plants\n\nCoincidentally, just 12 days before, a movie studio released a thriller titled “The China Syndrome,” featuring a fictitious accident at a California nuclear power plant. At one point in the film, one character, an expert on nuclear power, intones that a meltdown could “render an area the size of Pennsylvania uninhabitable.”\n\nBeginning at 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979, when a valve malfunctioned and the core of the unit 2 reactor began melting, that was the fear. And it was right in the middle of Pennsylvania.\n\n'Like the 'Twilight Zone.''\n\nAcross the Susquehanna River, Christine Layman, then 21, was at Rocky Ridge Park with her 4-year-old daughter, hiking the trails and looking for treasure. At the north end of the park, on an outcrop of rocks, you can stand and see, in the horizon, past the rolling farmland of northeastern York County, the nuclear plant's massive cooling towers.\n\nA day later, Layman felt ill. She thought it was the flu. She hadn’t been aware that something had happened at TMI, but like just about everybody else in the region, she was unclear on the details. The initial reports of the accident were confusing, to say the least. Met-Ed downplayed the accident, even as others were raising alarms.\n\nAt some point, an emergency vehicle trundled down her street and over loudspeakers, informed residents that pregnant women and young children should leave the area. She packed up her daughter and, with the clothes on her back, she drove to her mother’s house in Manchester.\n\nFrom there, she went to an aunt’s place in Hanover at the other end of the county, where she stayed and watched as the news grew worse and she began to fear that she’d never be able to return home.\n\n“It felt like the ‘Twilight Zone,’” she said. “It was unreal.”\n\n'Nobody knew what was going on'\n\nThat is how a lot of those who lived through the accident describe the experience – unreal. For a few days, perhaps a few weeks, thousands fled the area, unsure that they’d ever be able to return.\n\nAmong those was Mart Goodling.\n\nHe was working at a bank in Middletown when news of the accident broke. Nobody, he said, knew what to do. “Nobody knew what was going on,” he said recently as he ate breakfast at the Brownstone Café on the main drag in town. “We thought the best thing to do was leave.”\n\nHe drove to his son’s school and then home and then to his hunting cabin in Potter County, 185 miles away. He took his hunting rifles and fishing gear, thinking that he and his family might have to live off the land for a while.\n\n“It scared the hell out of people.” he said.\n\nMore:VIDEO: Press conference with MetEd the day after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979\n\nMore:Living across the river from Three Mile Island\n\nMore:Remember: Panic at Three Mile Island March 28, 1979\n\nDebate over health effects\n\nThe accident itself was bad, destroying the reactor and leading to the release of radioactive steam – damage that seems to pale in light of subsequent, devastating accidents at nuclear power plants in Chernobyl in the Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan.\n\nHow much radiation was released was a point of contention. Early on, monitors set up to measure radiation did not detect significant amounts. Follow-up studies also concluded that the release of radiation was minimal, far less than a person would be exposed to during a chest X-ray.\n\nThere are those who dispute those claims, citing anecdotal evidence to suggest a spike in cancers in the area downwind from the plant, within what had become known as the “plume” of contaminants released by the accident.\n\nLayman is among those. She has suffered some health consequences that she attributes to radiation exposure - thyroid problems, infertility, brain lesions – and she knows a lot of her neighbors who have battled cancer in the years after the accident.\n\nShe administrates a Facebook group, Three Mile Island Survivors, that at one point, had about 5,000 members, giving those who believe that TMI adversely affected their health a platform to tell their stories.\n\nShe and others in the group believe that the government and the industry never told the truth about how much radiation was released. “From being there and seeing how they did not know anything at the time,\" she said, \"it put doubt in my mind that they knew what’s going on.”\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission has long held that even though some radiation did escape during the accident, the emissions were at such a low level that they could not cause any ill health effects. Studies over the years reached the same conclusion.\n\nHowever, in 2017, a study by researchers at Penn State concluded that a variety of thyroid cancer found in patients who lived in the area during the accident indicated that it may have been caused by exposure to low-level radiation.\n\nThe researchers point out that doesn’t mean the cancer was caused by exposure during the TMI accident; Pennsylvania has one of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in the United States, most of which are not attributed to radiation exposure. The study, researchers pointed out, was limited, and a larger, follow-up study is planned.\n\nIn a small way, the study was comforting.\n\n“It validates the stories I’ve heard,” Layman said. “I don’t want the industry to say no one was harmed by the accident. I don’t want my great-great-grandchildren hearing that no one was harmed.”\n\nA ghost town\n\nIn the days following the accident, Middletown, and across the river in Goldsboro, York Haven and much of northern York County, was a ghost town.\n\nBraasch had left the area for a job interview in San Antonio, Texas, two days after the accident. His wife and sons went to stay with her parents in New Jersey. When he returned home that weekend, he recalled he couldn’t get a taxi at the airport, the cabbies wouldn’t drive into the area.\n\nHe got a ride home. It was strange. His suburban development, just outside Middletown, was dark, not a light on in any home. His wife urged him to come to Jersey. He stayed. He had responsibilities at the radio station.\n\nHe went to work and recalled asking Pintek, “What’s going on?”\n\nPintek responded, “I have made peace, and I’m prepared to meet my maker.”\n\nBraasch, now 72, got the job in San Antonio but returned to Middletown when he and his wife couldn’t sell their home. He stayed in the region, working for decades in radio before his retirement.\n\nPintek died of pancreatic cancer last September at age 65.\n\n'Just part of the landscape'\n\nFor residents of the region, it was a terrifying few days. The fear was mollified a few days after the accident when then-President Jimmy Carter, trained as a nuclear engineer in the Navy, visited the plant and calmed the tattered nerves of residents.\n\nAs the weeks, months and years passed, TMI faded into the background. The plant’s unit 1 reactor, which was shut down at the time of the accident for maintenance, was restarted, and the familiar plumes of steam once again wafted from the cooling towers. Unit 2 was cleaned up and shut down, its cooling towers remain, but are dormant.\n\nAnd now, 40 years later, as TMI stands as an infamous icon of the nuclear industry, the plant remains controversial. Its current owner, Exelon, announced it would close by the end of the year because it has lost money the past five years. Elected officials and residents concerned about the loss of jobs rallied in favor of bailing out TMI, a sharp turn from the days when the same people vowed to fight to prevent unit 1 from restarting.\n\nIn the end, the planned shutdown moved ahead for Sept. 20, 2019.\n\nMore:Closing TMI: How to secure the infamous nuclear power site and why it may take 60 years\n\nFor a few years, TMI was a tourist destination, a stop as visitors to Central Pennsylvania made their way from Hershey to Gettysburg. That has dropped off, residents said.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nAuthorities in China have imposed a de facto international travel ban, forbidding citizens from going overseas for “non-essential” reasons, as the government ramps up efforts to enforce its zero-Covid policy.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Chinese National Immigration Administration said it would tighten its reviewing process on issuing travel documents such as passports, and strictly limit those looking to leave.\n\nThe administration justified the measures by claiming it was necessary to “reduce the risk of infection when leaving the country, and of carrying the virus when entering the country.” Travel will only be permitted for “essential” purposes, defined by the administration as resuming work, study, business and scientific research, as well as seeking medical care.\n\nThose who need to go abroad to help with fighting the pandemic, or transporting disaster relief resources will have their applications expedited, according to the announcement.\n\nOfficials did not reveal how they might enforce the new restrictions, or prevent would-be travelers in possession of valid travel documents from leaving.\n\nThe new measures represent China’s most stringent restrictions on outbound travel in decades, placing further strain on a population that has endured more than two years of draconian Covid-19 controls including citywide lockdowns, mass testing and mandatory quarantine.\n\n“Don’t go out unless necessary, don’t leave the country unless necessary, don’t be born unless necessary,” read one popular comment in reaction to the news on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\nOthers speculated officials might be cracking down on travel because more people are looking to escape as fears rise over new government-enforced lockdowns – especially in the capital Beijing, where Covid cases are rising. These fears have only been exacerbated by the chaos and dysfunction that has engulfed locked-down cities such as Shanghai.\n\nCovid workers check the travel information of passengers at a high-speed railway station in Huai 'an, China, on May 11.

Chinese citizens made 670 million overseas trips in 2019, the last normal travel year before the pandemic, according to the country’s Immigration Administration.\n\nBut that number has plunged since then, with just over 73 million inbound and outbound trips in 2021.\n\nEven before Thursday’s announcement, traveling in or out of China had become immensely difficult. The borders are still largely shut to outsiders, with only Chinese citizens returning from overseas and those with special visas or residence permits allowed to enter. Flights are limited and expensive – and all those wishing to enter usually face a strict quarantine of up to 21 days.\n\nChina has further discouraged travel by dramatically scaling back the number of travel documents issued. It only issued 7.98 million documents in 2021, less than 6% of the documents issued in 2019, according to the Immigration Administration – which also announced it would stop renewing passports for “non-essential” travel in February.\n\nThursday’s restrictions deal a blow to Chinese residents married to foreign nationals. It might also prove another roadblock for students wishing to attend university overseas – who already faced disappointment this week after the United States College Board announced it would cancel Advanced Placement (AP) tests – often considered an important part of college applications in the US – in several locations, citing “widespread Covid restrictions.”\n\nSix weeks of lockdown\n\nPublic frustration has been growing steadily over the past few months as authorities across the country imposed lockdown measures – sometimes over just a handful of cases.\n\nAt least 32 cities across China are now under full or partial lockdown, impacting up to 220 million people, according to CNN’s calculations.\n\nThe most notable among them is Shanghai, the wealthy financial hub, which has been under citywide lockdown since late March. Throughout April, residents stuck at home reported being unable to access food, medicine or other essential supplies.\n\nIn recent days, complaints have surfaced on social media over community workers forcibly entering people’s homes without permission and damaging their personal belongings during disinfection. One viral video showed residents arguing with police officers trying to take them from their homes; it’s unclear under what policy the residents were being forcibly removed, or where they were being sent.\n\nPeople wait in long lines at a supermarket on May 12 in Beijing, China.

Beijing authorities have encouraged residents to stay home, and began rolling out several new rounds of mass testing – prompting panic buying at supermarkets, with photos showing long lines as residents rushed to stock up on supplies in case of a lockdown.\n\nBeijing officials refuted claims of an impending lockdown on Thursday and urged the public not to hoard food, asserting there were enough supplies available. But their reassurance may do little good, with public trust already frayed – especially since Shanghai’s citywide lockdown had come just days after authorities there denied any such plans.\n\n“This is a familiar picture,” one Weibo user remarked under a video showing Beijing officials trying to calm the public.

That's an increase of 446 confirmed cases, or 6.2%, since Wednesday when the state reported 7,202 identified cases and 304 deaths. Sixteen new deaths were reported since Wednesday.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 3,900, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested. The state announced on April 23 that anyone who thinks they could be infected can now get tested.\n\nSupermarkets grapple with possible meat shortages during coronavirus\n\nApril 30: Roughly two months after coronavirus fears began to surface, altering many consumer purchasing patterns, toilet paper remains in scarce supply on the shelves of grocery stores around the Phoenix metro area.\n\nCould beef, pork and poultry items face similar shortages in the weeks and months ahead?\n\nThat prospect is looming larger amid reports of coronavirus outbreaks at meat-packing factories around the nation that have made some workers too sick to work — and prompting some giant processors like Tyson Foods to halt production at certain plants. Grocery-industry representatives aren't sounding the alarms, but anxiety has risen.\n\n“I have not heard of hoarding at this point, but I do know supplies at the grocer have been thinner than normal during this entire crisis just due to disruption in the supply chain and now wellness issues in packing plants of other states,” said Stef Smallhouse, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 7,202 confirmed cases, 304 known deaths as of Wednesday\n\nApril 29: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 7,200, with 304 known deaths, according to new numbers released on Wednesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 7,202, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 254 confirmed cases, or 3.7%, since Tuesday when the state reported 6,948 identified cases and 293 deaths. Eleven new deaths were reported since Tuesday.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 3,700, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.

The youngest patient was 33 and only one patient had a history of stroke.\n\n2nd inmate in Arizona prisons dies from coronavirus\n\nApril 28: A 79-year-old man with lung cancer became the second inmate in Arizona’s prisons to die from the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe prisoner known as Sittingdown, who didn’t have a first name and also was known as Robert E. Proell, died Friday of COVID-19 and lung cancer, according to André Davis, investigations supervisor at Pinal County Medical Examiner’s Office.\n\nSittingdown, who had been in prison for the last 35 years for sexual conduct with a minor, was housed at the prison in Florence. Sittingdown was taken to a hospital in Florence on April 18 and died there six days later, according to records.\n\nThe Florence prison has the most reported COVID-19 cases and accounts for 34 of the 49 confirmed cases in state prisons.\n\nMLB may start season in home stadiums in June, sources say\n\nApril 28: Maybe it’s a dream scenario. Then again, maybe it just might work.\n\nMajor League Baseball officials have become cautiously optimistic this week that the season will start in late June, and no later than July 2, playing at least 100 regular-season games, according to three executives with knowledge of the talks. They requested anonymity because the plan was still under consideration.\n\nAnd not only would baseball be played, but it would be played in their own major-league ballparks, albeit with no fans.\n\nMLB is considering a three-division, 10-team plan in which teams play only within their division – a concept gaining support among owners and executives. It would abolish the traditional American and National Leagues, and realign the divisions based on geography.\n\nThe plan, pending approval of medical experts and providing that COVID-19 testing is available to the public, would eliminate the need for players to be in isolation and allow them to still play at their home ballparks while severely reducing travel.\n\nThe US now has 1 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus\n\nApril 28: The United States topped 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus Tuesday – nearly a third of the world's cases – as health authorities here and around the globe try to understand the full scope of who is at risk and who has been infected.\n\nReaching seven figures – 1,002,498 to be exact – is the latest milestone for the U.S., which has topped 57,000 deaths during the pandemic, according to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. That's a number approaching the 58,220 Americans killed in the Vietnam War from 1955 to 1975.\n\nAnd despite warnings from national health leaders that the country could face a second wave of the virus in late 2020, states and cities are drafting or implementing plans to get people out of their homes and back into mainstream life.\n\nIt's all happened in about three months. That's when the country's first case was confirmed, and much of what we know about the virus is still subject to study and debate.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 6,948 confirmed cases, 293 known deaths as of Tuesday\n\nApril 28: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 6,900, with 293 known deaths, according to new numbers released on Tuesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 6,948, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 232 confirmed cases, or 3.5%, since Monday when the state reported 6,716 identified cases and 275 deaths. 18 new deaths were reported since Monday.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now approach 3,600, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested. The state announced Thursday that anyone who thinks they could be infected can now get tested.\n\nA North Carolina pug tested positive for coronavirus, possibly the first dog in the U.S.\n\nApril 28: After several members of a North Carolina family tested positive for the new coronavirus, they found out their pet pug tested positive, too, possibly the first dog in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.\n\nBut owner Heather McLean, a hospital pediatrician and vice chair and associate professor at Duke University, hopes that it doesn’t spark too much concern over household pets contracting and spreading the virus.\n\nThe McLeans discovered Friday that their pug, Winston, tested positive for COVID-19. He didn’t display any severe symptoms before they found out, said McLean’s 17-year-old daughter, Sydney.\n\nTwo things did stand out to the family, though: “My dad heard him cough a lot,” she said. “He didn’t eat his breakfast one morning and it’s weird because he’s a pug, but who knows?”\n\nHeather and her husband, Sam, who works as a researcher and emergency physician at UNC-Chapel Hill, started developing mild symptoms in mid-March. She attributed her own symptoms — scratchy throat and mild headache among them — to allergies, but they worsened for a bit.\n\n'Can't imagine why': Donald Trump denies responsibility for disinfectant confusion after some states report increased calls\n\nApril 28: President Donald Trump said he takes no responsibility for a spike in cases of people misusing disinfectants after he wondered aloud last week about possibly injecting them as a treatment for coronavirus.\n\nWhen asked Monday about the increase of people in some states ingesting disinfectants Trump answered: \"I can't imagine why.\"\n\nWhen pressed about whether he takes any responsibility, Trump said, \"No, I don't.\"\n\nMaryland was one state that issued a warning against dangerous disinfectant use, with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency tweeting the agency had received \"several calls.\"\n\n\"This is a reminder that under no circumstances should any disinfectant product be administered into the body through injection, ingestion or any other route,\" the tweet said.\n\nThese are 6 new symptoms of the coronavirus the CDC added to its list\n\nApril 27: Chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a loss of taste or smell.\n\nThose are the six new symptoms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned could be signs of the coronavirus.\n\nThe additions come as health experts' understanding of the confounding disease evolves. The CDC previously listed fever, cough and shortness of breath as symptoms.\n\nPurdue works to reopen college for fall 2020\n\nApril 26: Nothing beats the campus experience at Purdue University, not even the coronavirus. That’s what officials at the Indiana university are hoping anyway, with President Mitch Daniels floating plans to reopen campus for in-person classes in the fall while saying the COVID-19 virus “poses close to zero lethal threat” to young people.\n\nPurdue was among the first wave of colleges to announce a shift from in-person classes in early March, leaving students, faculty and staff to adapt quickly to an online setting.\n\nNow, as some states move to reopen non-essential businesses and boost the economy, Purdue and Daniels are at the forefront of efforts to put students back on campus for the fall.\n\nFederal coronavirus strategy lurches as plans to help states change, then change again\n\nApril 25: The nation’s top federal disease agency had just started activating teams in nine states still relatively untouched by coronavirus when new orders came in last week from the White House coronavirus task force: shift resources to Tennessee and Nebraska, and double down in New Mexico and North Dakota.\n\nThen, three days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out yet another plan to expand the more targeted approach to all 50 states, on an uncertain timeline.\n\nThe strategy whiplash, documented in meeting notes and internal slides obtained by USA TODAY, comes after weeks of states and public health experts sounding alarms about the need for federal guidance on testing issues and how to ramp up public health staffing to trace coronavirus exposures.\n\nThe recent course corrections are a sign of the chaos around federal plans to help states return to some semblance of normalcy, as a national shutdown required to slow the spread of a virus stretches into its second month.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 6,280 confirmed cases, 273 known deaths as of Saturday\n\nApril 25: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 6,200, with 273 known deaths, according to new numbers released Saturday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 6,280, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 235 confirmed cases, or 3.9%, since Friday when the state reported 6,045 identified cases and 266 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 3,200, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested. The state announced Thursday that anyone who thinks they could be infected can now get tested.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 6,045 confirmed cases, 266 known deaths as of Friday\n\nArizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 6,000, with 266 known deaths, according to new numbers released Friday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 6,045, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 276 confirmed cases, or 4.8%, since Thursday when the state reported 5,769 identified cases and 249 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 3,100, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested. The state announced Thursday that anyone who thinks they could be infected can now get tested.\n\nExperts say there's no medical basis for Trump's suggestion that sunlight, disinfectants may treat coronavirus\n\nApril 24: President Donald Trump touted a federal study Thursday that indicates sunlight, humidity and certain disinfectants can weaken the coronavirus – a finding that prompted the president to float the idea of treating patients with those measures.\n\nTrump's remarks prompted a firestorm of criticism from doctors and medical researchers, accusations from the White House that the president was quoted out of context and a statement from the maker of the popular disinfectant Lysol warning that \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body.\"\n\nAdding fuel to the controversy, the White House published a revised transcript of Trump's press conference that changed the reaction of Deborah Birx to the idea. Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, was initially quoted in the transcript as saying \"That is a treatment.\" The corrected transcript quoted her saying that, \"Not as a treatment.\"\n\nHouse passes $484 billion coronavirus stimulus for small businesses and hospitals\n\nApril 23: The House approved a nearly half-trillion-dollar emergency bill Thursday that provides more funds for struggling hospitals and will rescue a small business loan program that was quickly depleted by companies impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe measure, which passed 388-5 with one lawmaker voting present, will now head to President Donald Trump for his signature. The president has signaled he was ready to approve the bill.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined four Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie, Jody Hice, Ken Buck and Andy Biggs — in voting against the measure. Independent Rep. Justin Amash voted present.\n\nThe $484 billion measure offers more funds for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was halted last week after dispersing all of its initial $349 billion.\n\nSouthwest CEO: Airline will be 'drastically smaller' if business doesn't improve soon\n\nApril 23: Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly, like his counterparts at other companies pummeled by the coronavirus crisis, has been fielding questions about the impact from anxious employees for nearly two months.\n\nThe questions, which Kelly answers in videos sent to its 60,000 workers, have taken a sobering turn at perennially profitable and always upbeat Southwest, underscoring the industry's uncertain future.\n\n\"Most of my co-workers are not processing the dark and dangerous reality,'' one employee said in an email, according to excerpts Kelly shared in this week's \"Ask Gary'' video.\n\n\"Our messages of strength have created a false sense of security. My co-workers talk about the losses at JetBlue and Delta yet somehow don't apply those numbers to Southwest.''\n\nKelly didn't get into financial specifics since Southwest won't report first quarter earnings and its second quarter outlook until April 28, but he did detail the industry's dire straits and the drastic steps Southwest will have to take if things don't improve soon.\n\nHe braced employees for the possibility of benefit and pay cuts and the first involuntary furloughs in the company's 50-year history but said the airline is doing everything it can to avoid that, raising billions of dollars in cash, slashing flights by more than half and parking hundreds of planes.\n\nCOVID-19 testing now allowed more broadly, state health department says\n\nApril 23: Anyone who thinks they could be infected with COVID-19 or who has been exposed to it can now get tested, the Arizona Department of Health Services said Thursday.\n\nPreviously, only people who were considered high-risk or those with certain symptoms, such as a fever or respiratory symptoms, could get a test.\n\nFor many weeks, people have reported not being able to get tested despite having symptoms and going to multiple health care providers. Testing capability was also impacted by supply chain issues like a lack of nasal swabs and test collection materials, and needed personal protective equipment for the workers who administer the tests.\n\nHouse is poised to vote on a nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill\n\nApril 23: A popular small-business loan program that closed last week when it ran out of money is about to get a cash infusion.\n\nThe House is likely to approve legislation Thursday that would pump $320 billion into the Paycheck Protection Program, which is designed to keep small businesses from shuttering and their workers from going on unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday.\n\nOther programs would get money under the bill. The $484 billion legislation includes funding for hospitals that have been overwhelmed during the crisis and money for a coronavirus testing program.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 5,769 confirmed cases, 249 known deaths as of Thursday\n\nApril 23: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 5,700, with 249 known deaths, according to new numbers released Thursday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 5,769, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 310 confirmed cases, or 5.7%, since Wednesday when the state reported 5,459 identified cases and 229 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now approach 3,000, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nElective surgeries in Arizona to resume May 1\n\nArizona coronavirus update: 5,459 confirmed cases, 229 known deaths as of Wednesday\n\nApril 22: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 5,400, with 229 known deaths, according to new numbers released Wednesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 5,459, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 208 confirmed cases, or 3.96%, since Tuesday when the state reported 5,251 identified cases and 208 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,800, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nCoronavirus at meat packing plants worse than first thought\n\nApril 22: A rash of coronavirus outbreaks at dozens of meat packing plants across the nation is far more extensive than previously thought, according to an exclusive review of cases by USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nAnd it could get worse. More than 150 of America’s largest meat processing plants operate in counties where the rate of coronavirus infection is already among the nation’s highest, based on the media outlets’ analysis of slaughterhouse locations and county-level COVID-19 infection rates.\n\nThese facilities represent more than 1 in 3 of the nation’s biggest beef, pork and poultry processing plants. Rates of infection around these plants are higher than those of 75% of other U.S. counties, the analysis found.\n\nAnd while experts say the industry has thus far maintained sufficient production despite infections in at least 2,200 workers at 48 plants, there are fears that the number of cases could continue to rise and that meat packing plants will become the next disaster zones.\n\nWhite House, congressional leaders reach deal to replenish coronavirus small business loan program\n\nApril 21: The White House and congressional leaders reached a deal Tuesday to revive a stimulus program geared to keep small businesses from shuttering and their employees from going on unemployment because of the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe nearly half-trillion deal will provide more funds to the Paycheck Protection Program, which was halted last week after it ran out of money.\n\nThe $484 billion bill will inject the program, which provides loans to small businesses, with more than $310 billion. Of that, $60 billion will be set aside for community-based lenders, smaller banks and credit unions to assist smaller businesses that don't have established relationships with big banks and had a harder time accessing the funds in the first round of loans. It will also bolster the Small Business Administration's disaster loan and grant programs, which had also dried up due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe deal also includes $75 billion to help overwhelmed hospitals and $25 billion for coronavirus testing, two provisions Democrats pushed for in negotiations.\n\nFauci takes heat from protesters of stay-at-home orders, says ignoring guidelines will 'backfire'\n\nApril 21: Asked Monday while appearing on ABC's Good Morning America about protests popping up around the country against local stay-at-home measures, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned such demonstrations may \"backfire.\"\n\n“I think the message is that, clearly, this is something that is hurting from the standpoint of economics, from the standpoint of things that have nothing to do with the virus,” Fauci replied. “But, unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery, economically, is not gonna happen.”\n\nHe continued, “If you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re gonna set yourself back. So as painful as it is to go by the careful guidelines of gradually phasing into a reopening, it’s going to backfire. That’s the problem.”\n\n5,251 confirmed cases, 208 known deaths as of Tuesday\n\nApril 21: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 5,200, with 208 known deaths, according to new numbers released Tuesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 5,251, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 187 confirmed cases, or 3.7%, since Monday when the state reported 5,064 identified cases and 187 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,700, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least two cases.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nProtesters rally at Arizona Capitol, calling for end of stay-at-home order\n\nApril 20: Hundreds of people gathered near the Arizona state Capitol on Monday calling for an end to Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order that closed non-essential businesses in March.\n\nThe Patriot's Day Rally — hosted by a group called Reopen Arizona — started at noon Monday at the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza near the state Capitol in Phoenix. American flags and Trump campaign paraphernalia were abundant as people streamed into the plaza before marching across the street to the state Capitol, demanding businesses reopen and employees be allowed to return to work.\n\nThe event took place a day after Operation Gridlock Arizona, where roughly 100 cars circled the plaza, people honked their horns, held up protest signs and called for businesses to reopen.\n\nNo arrests or citations were made in relation to Monday's rally, according to Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves.\n\nTrump announces suspension of immigration to 'protect jobs'\n\nApril 20: President Trump tweeted late Monday that he was temporarily suspending immigration to the U.S. The president cited the need to protect jobs in light of “the attack from the Invisible Enemy,” a reference to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump tweeted.\n\nPresident Trump said he would be enacting the change in policy by signing an executive order to shut down immigration. Over the past weeks of the crisis, which has seen many states shut down, the administration has made moves to clamp down on asylum seekers and immigrants seeking entry into the country. Critics contend that Trump is using the crisis, which has killed more than 40,000 Americans and paralyzed the economy, to further his America First policies.\n\nBig banks sued over small business stimulus\n\nApril 20: Two companies in California filed a class-action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase bank alleging unfair business practices toward some small businesses that applied for coronavirus-related loans under the government's Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nIn the suit filed on Sunday, a cybersecurity firm and event planning company accused Chase Bank of prioritizing small business borrowers who were seeking larger loan amounts rather than processing the government-sponsored loan applications on a first-come, first-serve basis as advertised.\n\nThe move meant that Chase would collect larger processing fees – nearly $6 billion in total – by frontloading the queue with businesses seeking higher loans, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe businesses seeking lower loans were deprioritized, so many didn't get the aid they were entitled to, the lawsuit filed on behalf of small businesses said.\n\nThe legal action is one in a series of lawsuits lodged by small businesses against big banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Bancorps citing unfair business practices and false advertising.\n\nThe loans were a part of a $349 billion emergency small business lending program meant to keep businesses afloat and staffers employed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nExpert: Arizona 'miles away from being prepared to reopen'\n\nApril 19: With Arizona and other states considering reopening their economies on May 1, health experts said the state isn't yet doing enough COVID-19 testing or collecting good enough data to responsibly lift stay-at-home orders.\n\nArizona has done 51,000 tests through Saturday, a fraction of the COVID-19 tests needed to judge how widespread the outbreak is in a state this size. Measured in tests per million residents, Arizona was in the bottom 10 states nationwide last week.\n\nAnd data the state provides is widely seen as inadequate. The state is missing demographic data about positive cases and deaths, its location data mixes hospitals with private residences, and the state won't provide data about cases and deaths on Indian reservations or in nursing homes.\n\n\"It just isn't going to work unless you have crystal clear data,\" said William Haseltine, an infectious disease expert and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International. \"If Arizona doesn't have that they are miles away from being prepared to reopen.\"\n\nBroadway star Nick Cordero has leg amputated because of COVID-19\n\nApril 19: Nick Cordero's wife said the Broadway actor made it through surgery to have his right leg amputated because of complications from coronavirus.\n\nAmanda Kloots shared Saturday night in an Instagram Story that she had just gotten \"a call from the surgeon\" following the procedure.\n\n\"He made it through the surgery, which is really big,\" Kloots said. \"They're taking him back to the room to recover and rest for the rest of the night, so hopefully he'll just kind of relax and rest.\"\n\nKloots told followers earlier Saturday that she had received some \"difficult news.\" She explained that blood thinners doctors were using to help with clotting in Cordero's leg were causing issues with his blood pressure and internal bleeding in his intestines.\n\n\"We took him off blood thinners but that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated,\" she said.\n\nArizona reaches more than 4,900 coronavirus cases, with 184 known deaths\n\nArizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, rose to 4,929, with 184 known deaths, according to new numbers released Sunday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThat's an increase of 210 confirmed cases, or 4.4%, since Saturday when the state reported 4,719 identified cases and 177 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,589, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nPeople are flocking to reopened Florida beaches\n\nApril 18: People came faster than a flock of seagulls chasing a french fry when Florida beaches began reopening Friday as the coronavirus pandemic raged on.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis gave municipalities the go-ahead to reopen during a news conference Friday – if it can be done safely, while observing social distancing guidelines. A day earlier, President Donald Trump rolled out a three-phase approach for reopening the nation.\n\nWith the governor's green light, north Florida beaches were among the first to allow people to return since being closed down by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry announced that Duval County beaches would reopen Friday afternoon with restricted hours, and could be used only for walking, biking, hiking, fishing, running, swimming, taking care of pets and surfing. Visit Florida lists beaches by county in Florida and their status: closed, restricted or otherwise.\n\nThe beaches will be open from 6 to 11 a.m. and 5 to 8 p.m local time, Curry said in a video posted to Twitter. Gatherings of 50 or more people are prohibited.\n\nHere's where your missing stimulus check went\n\nApril 18: Americans are reaching out to tax preparers and lining up at their offices around the country to find out what happened to their stimulus checks.\n\nOne answer: The IRS sent those missing payouts to an intermediary bank account if a client got an advance on their tax return, tax professionals say.\n\nClients tipped tax preparers off to the problem when they used Get My Payment, the government’s new stimulus deposit tracking portal, and uncovered that the payments of up to $1,200 for individuals were sent to an account number they didn't recognize.\n\nAgencies that help people file for government-issued refunds are receiving an influx of calls regarding the one-time payout meant to be disbursed to 80 million Americans this week. While many people received the deposit, other payments may have gotten inadvertently sent to temporary accounts created during the tax filing process.\n\nThe IRS said it is moving to provide additional information and resolve any issues as soon as possible.\n\nArizona coronavirus update: Cases climb to more than 4,700, with 177 known deaths\n\nApril 18: Arizona reported eight more deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, a day after a widely-respected model of the disease's progression predicted that the state had passed its likely peak in hospital resources and deaths.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 4,719, with 177 known deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Arizona Department of Health Services. That's an increase of 212 confirmed cases, or 4.7%, since Friday, when the state reported 4,507 identified cases and 169 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,400, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nA model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation that shows nationwide and international projections was updated Friday and shows a significantly different path for the disease in Arizona than earlier projections.\n\nThe institute's Arizona model estimates \"peak resource\" use was on April 10 — that means hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators were at their greatest use that day. Based on projections, Arizona has enough beds to meet the continued demand. The earlier projection was April 30.\n\nThe projected peak in deaths per day was April 5, with 12 deaths that day, even though Arizona surpassed that number Friday. The earlier projection was May 2.\n\nLatinos disproportionately dying, losing jobs because of coronavirus: 'We are strong people, but something has to change'\n\nIn a city where 16% of the population is Latino, physician Alicia Fernandez is alarmed by the overwhelming number of Latino patients she is seeing at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nFernandez blames the high cost of housing in the Bay Area, which finds many impoverished Latinos crowded into small apartments. “Sometimes it’s big families, but others it’s just a group of adults trying to make ends meet,” she says. “It makes it so hard to isolate and quarantine folks.”\n\nIn Nashville, school teacher Bobbi Negròn has been paying close attention to the havoc being wreaked on the lives of her fellow Latinos. When Negròn calls to see how some of her elementary school students are faring, parents sometimes ask her to stop phoning as they don’t have any minutes left on their cell plans.\n\nIn New York, a grim tally tells the tale: Latinos make up 29% of the population but are 39% of those who have succumbed to COVID-19, the respiratory illness causes by the virus.\n\nMovie theaters would be among the first businesses to reopen after coronavirus under Trump plan\n\nApril 17: Break out the popcorn.\n\nAs the country takes the first baby steps back from the coronavirus shutdown, movie theaters could be one of the early beneficiaries.\n\nCinemas would be allowed to reopen in the first of three phases under the guidelines released Thursday by the White House.\n\nJust when theaters, along with restaurants, sports stadiums and churches, will be allowed to welcome back the public under the Trump administration plan is yet to be seen. It will be left largely up to governors to decide when their states are ready to take the first step back to what was once considered normal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in announcing the reopening at his daily news conference, said some are more ready than others. The plan didn't include a timetable.\n\n4,507 confirmed cases, 169 known deaths as of Friday\n\nApril 17: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 4,500, with 169 known deaths, according to new numbers released Friday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 4,507, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 273 confirmed cases, or 6.4%, since Thursday, when the state reported 4,234 identified cases and 150 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,400, according to state numbers. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nMore detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was first released by the state Sunday and continues to be updated.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the state reported death totals from these counties: 69 in Maricopa, 51 in Pima, 24 in Coconino (county officials reported 26), 11 in Navajo, five in Pinal and four in Apache.\n\nMohave County reported two deaths, and Yavapai, Yuma and La Paz reported one each, as of Thursday. Information on deaths in those counties differed on the state site early Friday, showing fewer than three deaths for each of the four counties.\n\nWhat is OSHA doing? Crisis raises questions about workplace safety agency\n\nIn South Dakota, the virus struck hundreds of workers at a single pork processing plant. In Illinois and Michigan, a half dozen grocery workers died and others fell ill. In New York, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of dozens of transit employees. Among health care workers, at least 27 have died and 9,200 have contracted the virus.\n\nAs the country contemplates returning more employees to work and reopening the economy, the key federal agency tasked with ensuring workplace safety is drawing withering criticism from advocates who say the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is falling down on the job.\n\n“OSHA has been totally absent from the response,” said David Michaels, an epidemiologist and public health professor at The George Washington University who oversaw the agency during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2017. “It is shocking and disheartening because OSHA should be out front leading the federal efforts to protect workers.”\n\nDrinking alcohol may heighten risk of getting coronavirus, WHO suggests\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic leaves millions stuck at home, alcohol sales have risen drastically nationwide, with spirits and premixed cocktails in high demand.\n\nThe World Health Organization, however, says alcohol may put people at increased risk for the coronavirus, weakening the body's immune system and leaving drinkers at risk for other risky behaviors that could increase the likelihood of contracting coronavirus.\n\nIt does work as a disinfectant on surfaces, but too much alcohol consumption can actually make the body less capable of handling the coronavirus. A 2015 study published in the journal Alcohol Research found that excessive alcohol consumption is associated with \"adverse immune-related health effects such as susceptibility to pneumonia.”\n\n4,234 confirmed cases, 150 known deaths as of Thursday\n\nApril 16: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 4,200, with 150 known deaths, according to new numbers released Thursday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 4,234, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 272 confirmed cases, or 6.9%, since Wednesday, when the state reported 3,962 identified cases and 142 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,200. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nMore detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was first released by the state Sunday and continues to be updated.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the state reported death totals from these counties: 64 in Maricopa, 37 in Pima, 24 in Coconino (county officials reported 26), 11 in Navajo, five in Pinal and four in Apache.\n\nCoronavirus, diabetes, obesity and other underlying conditions: Which patients are most at risk?\n\nApril 15: Though people of all ages are affected by coronavirus, many of those who develop severe complications after contracting it have preexisting medical conditions. According to a CDC report, nearly 90% of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US had one or more underlying diseases.\n\nThe most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These conditions were even more prevalent in deceased COVID-19 patients, according to data released by Louisiana, New York and New Jersey.\n\nWas your Arizona unemployment claim rejected? Hold tight — the state is re-evaluating thousands of applications\n\nApril 15: Have you applied for jobless benefits in the past several weeks and been denied? You still might get some help, according to the Arizona Department of Economic Security.\n\nThe state is re-evaluating what likely are thousands of applications from the past two months to see if they should qualify under more generous federal guidelines passed by Congress, which include an additional $600 a week in benefits on top of the $240 maximum offered by the state for some people.\n\nCongress passed, and President Trump signed, the CARES Act on March 27. It expands jobless benefits to nearly everyone put out of work, including part-time workers, contractors and the self-employed. Gov. Doug Ducey also expanded eligibility benefits by waiving the usual one-week waiting period and requirement that people getting jobless benefits continue to look for work.\n\nMany people who have lost their jobs or had their hours reduced because of the national effort to prevent spreading coronavirus, were rejected by the Arizona Department of Economic Security.\n\nMany people are denied because they don't have sufficient earnings history to qualify for state benefits.\n\nBut the changes from Congress allow people in that situation, including contractors, part-timers and the self-employed, to get paid.\n\n\"DES will review all applications that have been determined 'monetarily ineligible,' since Feb. 2 to determine eligibility for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance,\" said Brett Bezio, deputy press secretary for DES.\n\nHe could not say how many applications needed to be reviewed, but the department has seen a historic number of first-time applications in the past four weeks, with 345,800 people seeking benefits.\n\n3,962 confirmed cases, 142 known deaths as of Wednesday\n\nApril 15: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now approach 4,000, with 142 known deaths, according to new numbers released on Wednesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 3,962, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 156 confirmed cases, or 4%, since Tuesday when the state reported 3,806 identified cases and 131 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,100. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nMore detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was released by the state on Sunday.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the state reported death totals from the following counties: 60 in Maricopa, 34 in Pima, 24 in Coconino, 10 in Navajo, five in Pinal and four in Apache.\n\nTrump announces 'halt' in US funding to World Health Organization\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration will \"halt\" U.S. funding to the World Health Organization as it conducts a review of the global organization's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion,\" the president said in a Rose Garden press conference.\n\nTrump has accused the organization of not moving quickly enough to sound the alarm over COVID-19 and of being too China friendly. He has attacked the agency for advising the U.S. against banning travel from China to other parts of the world amid the outbreak.\n\n\"And the World — WHO — World Health got it wrong,\" the president told reporters at the White House last week. \"I mean, they got it very wrong. In many ways, they were wrong. They also minimized the threat very strongly and — not good.\"\n\nGov. Ducey to hold press conference at 2:30 p.m.\n\nHow to track your stimulus check\n\nApril 14: Slowly but surely, taxpayers are telling their friends, and yes, posting news on social media, that they're already seeing stimulus cash arrive in their bank accounts.\n\nAnd the Internal Revenue Service is expected to give you a new online tool as soon as Wednesday to get a better clue on when you'll see your Economic Impact Payment via IRS.gov/eip. The IRS said the tool will let you go online to check the status of a payment, including the date it's scheduled to be deposited or mailed.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a press briefing Monday that Treasury is ahead of schedule in getting the money out and expects that more than 80 million people will receive their stimulus money by Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury expects that a \"large majority of eligible Americans will receive Economic Impact Payments within the next two weeks.\"\n\n3,806 confirmed cases, 131 known deaths as of Tuesday\n\nApril 14: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,800, with 131 known deaths, according to new numbers released on Tuesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 3,806, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 104 confirmed cases, or 2.8%, since Monday when the state reported 3,702 identified cases and 122 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,000. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nMore detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was released by the state on Sunday.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nPresident Trump retweets a call for Dr. Anthony Fauci's dismissal\n\nApril 13: President Donald Trump generated new questions about the fate of his anti-coronavirus policy team by retweeting a post that called for firing Anthony Fauci.\n\nTrump did not explicitly endorse the call to remove Fauci in his Sunday tweet, but in recirculating it, he defended himself against claims he did not act quickly enough to curb the spread of the virus that has killed thousands and led to a near-shutdown of the American economy.\n\nDeAnna Lorraine, a pro-Trump congressional candidate who polled less than 2% in a recent open primary challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claimed in a tweet that \"Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large.\"\n\nShe added: \"Time to #FireFauci...\"\n\nTrump and Fauci, the long-time director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have disputed each other during the course of the epidemic.\n\n3,702 confirmed cases, 122 known deaths as of Monday\n\nApril 13: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,700, with 122 known deaths, according to new numbers released Monday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 3,702, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 163 confirmed cases, or 4.6%, since Sunday when the state reported 3,539 identified cases and 115 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 2,000. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nMore detailed data, including cases by ZIP code and race/ethnicity, was released by the state at noon Sunday.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the state reported death totals from the following counties: 52 in Maricopa, 29 in Pima, 21 in Coconino, eight in Navajo, four in Pinal and four in Apache.\n\nCoronavirus by ZIP code: New data shows where cases are found across Arizona\n\nApril 12: Arizona health officials for the first time released coronavirus data by ZIP code on Sunday. The data showed hot spots of infections near Indian reservations, especially around Page, along with large numbers of cases in Scottsdale and Tucson.\n\nYet the state excluded much of the information needed to identify locations of outbreaks in the state.\n\nThe state Department of Health Services published its data as a map, showing a number of cases for each ZIP code. ZIP codes with more than 10 cases gave a specific number. Those with fewer gave ranges: \"0,\" \"1-5\" or \"6-10.\"\n\nThe team from AZ Data Central extracted the case figures from the state's map, assembling many of the data points by hand.\n\nThe state's map shows every ZIP code with more than 10 cases as red.\n\nTo give a truer view of the pandemic's impact in Arizona, AZ Data Central's map presents the number as of Sunday relative to the population of each ZIP code.\n\nAs states restrict Easter gatherings, churches and lawmakers push back\n\nApril 12: In Kansas, that battle has reached the Supreme Court. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly filed a lawsuit Thursday after a Republican-dominated legislative panel overturned her executive order banning religious and funeral services of more than 10 attendees during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRepublican Senate President Susan Wagle painted the executive order as an attack on Christians. \"Now, during Holy Week for Christians, she is closing our churches,\" Wagle said on Twitter. \"We are doing our part to slow the spread.\"\n\nUS now has more COVID-19 deaths than any other country\n\nApril 11: The United States has passed Italy to become the country with the most coronavirus deaths. However, as a proportion of the total population in the U.S., virus deaths remain at about one-sixth of those in hard-hit Italy or Spain.\n\nMore than 19,700 people in the U.S. have died due to complications from the coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. Friday, the U.S. saw its highest daily death count yet, at 2,108.\n\nItaly's death toll was at 19,468 and Spain, the nation with the third-most fatalities, had 16,353 reported deaths. Worldwide, the death count has surpassed 104,000.\n\nEstimates on how many people will end up dying in the U.S. have fluctuated in recent weeks as new data continues to pour in.\n\nA leading projection model from the University of Washington has forecast about 60,000 deaths in the country, far less than the 100,000 to 240,000 deaths that were projected in a White House release less than two weeks ago.\n\n3,393 confirmed cases, 108 known deaths as of Saturday\n\nApril 11: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,300, with 108 known deaths, according to new numbers released Saturday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 3,393, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 281 confirmed cases, or 9%, since Friday when the state reported 3,112 identified cases and 97 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 1,800. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the state reported death totals from the following counties: 47 in Maricopa, 29 in Pima, 15 in Coconino, seven in Navajo and three each in Pinal and Apache. Mohave County reported two deaths and Yavapai and La Paz reported one each, though those did not appear on the state's dashboard.\n\n100 more ventilators on their way to Arizona\n\nApril 10: Gov. Doug Ducey today said 100 additional ventilators will be sent to Arizona from the Strategic National Stockpile, at the request of Ducey and U.S. Sen. Martha McSally.\n\n\"These ventilators will add to our surge capacity and help us prepare in our tribal communities and elsewhere,\" Ducey said in a statement. \"President Trump and I spoke about this Wednesday night. I’m grateful that he was able to deliver on this request immediately.\"\n\nDucey said he had been in touch with Navajo President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer about the Navajo Nation's needs for supplies, personnel and ventilators to fight COVID-19.\n\n\"Our goal is that we will never need these ventilators and can eventually send them to other regions of the country, but this action by President Trump and Vice President Pence will help ensure Arizona is prepared for a worst-case scenario,” Ducey said.\n\nMcSally said in her statement, “This is potentially life-saving news for Arizona.”\n\nLooking for Lysol spray and Clorox wipes? Here’s when you can buy again\n\nApril 10: As the coronavirus locks down more of the country, shelf after shelf of Lysol sprays and Clorox wipes has been picked clean by shoppers preparing for the possibility that they could be quarantined for weeks or months.\n\nStore limits on disinfecting wipes and sprays haven’t slowed the fear-fueled run as households stock up on cleaning products to protect against infection. Neither have eye-popping prices online and off.\n\nIn March, sales of aerosol disinfectants jumped 343% and multipurpose cleaners 166% from a year ago, according to research firm Nielsen. And still, people are scouring the internet's vast virtual shelves and local stores for more.\n\nHow could something so basic suddenly be so hard to get?\n\nManufacturers like Clorox were not prepared for skyrocketing demand in a sleepy sector with reliably steady sales that usually only fluctuate during flu season. And, with global supply chains snarled by the coronavirus, they now can’t produce enough inventory to meet that demand, supply chain experts say.\n\nClorox 4-in-1 Disinfecting Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Spray are among the products that the Environmental Protection Agency says likely protect against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n“Nobody ever expected this to happen, and they got caught flatfooted,” says Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University. “They don’t have enough ingredients. They don’t have enough capacity.”\n\nDisinfectant products manufacturers say they are rushing to churn out as much as they can as quickly as they can.\n\nBy mid-May, supply chains should return to normal and by June, out-of-stock disinfectants should begin reappearing on store shelves, predicts Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management. But intermittent shortages could persist for months, such as in the fall when people are expected to return to work and children to school.\n\nCoronavirus antibody testing: What is it? Can it reopen US economy?\n\nApril 10: As officials begin to discuss when they can lift stay-at-home orders, companies are rushing to develop coronavirus antibody tests that could help them make those decisions without risking a second wave of infections.\n\nLeading the fight against COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday morning on CNN that antibody testing can show who has developed immunity to the coronavirus and can safely go back to work without getting reinfected.\n\n“As we get to the point of at least considering opening up the country, as it were, it’s very important to appreciate and understand how much this virus is penetrating this society,” he said.\n\nHow would antibody tests factor into decisions to lift social distancing orders, and how reliable are those tests? Here's everything you need to know about antibody testing.\n\nWorld reaches 100,000 deaths; US has 'not reached the peak'\n\nApril 10: Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Friday that the U.S. has not \"reached the peak\" of the pandemic but that there were \"encouraging\" signs that the curves were flattening or lowering.\n\n\"This is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advances ... that we need to be pulling back at all,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci added at the Friday press briefing.\n\nMeanwhile, a leading projection of the pandemic had U.S. deaths from the virus at its peak Friday as the global death toll reached 100,000 lives. Research from the University of Washington in Seattle, which has created some of the preeminent modeling of the pandemic, indicated U.S. deaths could reach almost 2,000 on Friday but would fall in the coming days.\n\nElsewhere, travelers were being cautioned to stay home around the world to mark the traditions of Good Friday and the Easter weekend. Eagerly awaited stimulus checks should soon be hitting Americans' bank accounts. And New York now ha has more confirmed coronavirus cases than any other country in the world.\n\nThe U.S. surpassed 475,000 confirmed cases on Friday, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard. About 26,000 Americans have recovered.\n\n3,112 confirmed cases, 97 known deaths as of Friday\n\nApril 10: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,100, with 97 known deaths, according to new numbers released Friday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nArizona's total identified cases rose to 3,112, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 94 confirmed cases, or 3%, since Thursday when the state reported 3,018 identified cases and 89 deaths.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now exceed 1,700. All of Arizona's 15 counties have reported at least one case.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is higher than official numbers suggest because of limits on supplies and available tests, which led to the state issuing guidelines that restrict who should be tested.\n\nIceland tested 10% of its population for COVID-19. Here's what it learned\n\nApril 10: By Friday, Iceland will have achieved something no other country has: tested 10% of its population for coronavirus, a figure far higher than anywhere else in the world.\n\nNo country or scientist or doctor has all the answers about the pandemic that has swept the globe, infecting more than 1.6 million people and killing at least 95,000.\n\nBut some places, such as tiny Iceland, Europe's most sparsely populated country – pop. 364,134, broadly equivalent to the number of people in Tulsa, Oklahoma – may be better placed to deliver some types of coronavirus information, and even answers, than most, at least in the short term, according to public health experts, international government officials and others involved in responding to the outbreak.\n\nStimulus checks on the way\n\nApril 9: U.S. stocks surged higher despite mind-numbing jobless numbers while some Americans could begin receiving stimulus checks Thursday.\n\nSome of President Donald Trump's Cabinet signaled frustration with lockdowns and stay-at-home orders: Attorney General William Barr called restrictions in many states \"draconian;\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said parts of the economy could reopen by May.\n\nThe Dow was up more than 300 points. The Labor Department reported a staggering 6.6 million initial claims for unemployment insurance. And the saddest numbers: The U.S. death toll from the pandemic rocking the globe was nearing 15,000; there are now more than 432,000 confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nThere was a silver lining: A University of Washington health research center dropped its estimated U.S. death total from the coronavirus, placing the likely toll by August at about 60,000. Worldwide, there are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases and more than 90,000 deaths. And the nation's top health expert said he's optimistic of a turnaround.\n\nFauci lowers U.S. coronavirus death forecast to 60,000\n\nApril 9: Senior White House adviser Anthony Fauci said Thursday the death toll from the coronavirus could be closer to 60,000 Americans, assuming full social distancing, rather than the previously projected 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.\n\n\"The real data are telling us that it is highly likely that we're having a definite positive effect by these mitigation things that we're doing — this physical separation — so I believe we are gonna see a downturn in that,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC's Today show.\n\n“And it looks more like the 60,000 than the 100,000 to 200,000,” he said.\n\nFauci did not say which model he is using to come up with the estimate, but his comments came as a leading model from the University of Washington that experts in the White House have been using also predicted fewer Americans may die from coronavirus than previously thought.\n\nThat model now projects 60,415 people will die in the U.S. by Aug. 4, compared to previous projections that approached 100,000. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia will have fewer deaths than previously thought, under the model.\n\n3,018 confirmed cases, 89 known deaths as of Thursday\n\nApril 9: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 3,000, with 89 known deaths, according to new numbers released Thursday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona are 3,018, according to the most recent state figures. That's an increase of 292 confirmed cases, or 11%, since Wednesday when the state reported 2,726 identified cases and 80 deaths. That's a higher daily percent increase than recent days.\n\nMaricopa County's confirmed cases now approach 1,700. All of Arizona's 15 counties have at least one recorded case.\n\nThe number of Arizona cases likely is much higher than official numbers suggest. People have reported trouble getting tested, as health professionals confront confusion over who to test and face a lack of testing supplies.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Maricopa County recorded 39 deaths related to COVID-19. Pima County had 16 known deaths, Coconino had 15, Pinal and Mohave counties each had two deaths, and Navajo County reported one death, according to the respective county websites.\n\nAlmost all federal stockpile of personal protective equipment is depleted\n\nNinety percent of the federal personal protective equipment stockpile had been depleted as the Health and Human Services Department made its \"final shipments\" of N95 respirators, surgical and face masks, face shields, gowns and gloves, according to new documents released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee\n\nThe remaining 10% of the stockpile, HHS said, would be reserved for federal workers and would not be sent to the states.\n\nThe documents, which report the distribution of personal protective equipment to state and local governments as of April 6, show that only 11.7 million N95 respirator masks and 7,920 ventilators have been distributed across the nation — both amounts small fractions of the estimated amount of protective equipment needed by frontline medical workers.\n\nHHS confirmed to the Associated Press on Wednesday that the remaining equipment in the federal stockpile was in the process of being deployed.\n\nMore checks? Hazard pay? What might be in next stimulus bill\n\nApril 8: Americans have yet to receive their $1,200 stimulus checks from the federal government, but another round of cash payments could be coming their way.\n\nTalks are under way between the Trump administration and Congress on another recovery package to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. A second round of cash payments to Americans is part of the discussions.\n\n“We could very well do a second round,” President Donald Trump said at a White House news conference on Monday. “It is absolutely under serious consideration.”\n\nCongress already has approved three stimulus bills to juice the economy amid the coronavirus crisis. The largest is a $2.2 trillion economic recovery package that provides one-time payments of up to $1,200 to millions of Americans, as well as loans, grants and tax breaks for businesses reeling from the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.\n\n2,726 confirmed cases, 80 known deaths as of Wednesday\n\nApril 8: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 2,700, with 80 known deaths, according to new numbers released Wednesday by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona are 2,726, according to the most recent state figures.

His symptoms include a high temperature and a cough. He is conscious and has not been put on a ventilator.\n\nEarlier Monday, Johnson tweeted that he had a \"comfortable night\" and was in \"good spirits\" while receiving regular briefings from his Cabinet and government advisers.\n\nJohnson's illness means that he has had to effectively step away from day-to-day governing as Britain, like much of the world, faces the worst public health crisis in a century. Britain has more than 52,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,300 deaths, and the virus could reach its peak in the country as soon as this weekend.\n\nCuomo: Deaths, hospitalizations may be leveling off in New York\n\nApril 6: The number of daily COVID-19 hospitalizations in New York state declined again and deaths may be leveling off, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Cuomo also said he would ask President Donald Trump for permission to use the 1,000-bed USNS Comfort for COVID-19 patients since there is little demand for beds for other illnesses. The Comfort anchored in New York's harbor with a mission to treat non-virus patients so hospitals could concentrate on COVID patients.\n\nCuomo also said demand for hospital beds and ventilators may not reach numbers previously projected if residents continue to follow social distancing and other guidelines. But he also announced an increase in the fine, to $1,000 from $500, for failing to follow the rules.\n\n\"There is a real danger in getting overconfident,\" Cuomo said at his daily news conference. \"This is an enemy that we have underestimated from day one and we have paid the price dearly.\"\n\nUS stocks race higher\n\nApril 6: U.S. stocks rose sharply Monday: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were up more than 5% in early afternoon trading on signs of a slowdown in coronavirus deaths and new cases in some of the hardest-hit areas around the globe.\n\nGlobal shares also rose Monday as investors saw hopeful signs the coronavirus pandemic may be leveling off in hard-hit places such as Italy, Spain – and even New York.

They'll admit it when everything's over but that doesn't help us very much.“\n\nGovernors in hard-hit states like New York, Michigan and Louisiana say doctors could be forced to make life or death decisions about who will get ventilators and who won't if hospitals starting running out of the machines when the peak of the crisis hits.\n\nTrump says US to deploy 1,000 military personnel to New York City\n\nApril 4: President Donald Trump said Saturday he is deploying 1,000 medical personnel to New York City to help battle the coronavirus.\n\nPersonnel to be deployed will include doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists and others, Trump announced at a White House news briefing on Saturday.\n\n“We've been doing it, but now we're doing it on a larger basis,” Trump said.\n\nTrump did not say from which branches of the services the officials will be deployed. But he said they will be sent Sunday and Monday to New York, “where they’re needed most.”\n\nIRS's antiquated technology could delay $1,200 coronavirus stimulus checks\n\nApril 4: WASHINGTON – Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is promising that millions of Americans will receive $1,200 stimulus checks in just two weeks, but some tax experts and congressional officials are warning it may take much longer.\n\nAntiquated technology and staff reductions at the Internal Revenue Service have seriously hampered the agency’s ability to process checks in such a short period and could mean delays in sending the money to anxious Americans who are counting on the cash to get them through hard times caused by the coronavirus pandemic, experts say.\n\n“There are going to be a lot of people for whom this is going to take a while, and I think it’s going to be measured in terms of months, not weeks,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Tax Policy Center.\n\n2,019 cases and 52 known deaths\n\nApril 4: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now exceed 2,000, with 52 known deaths, according to new numbers released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona are 2,019 according to the most recent state figures.

It’s only a recommendation.”\n\nTrump repeatedly stressed it is voluntary. \"I don't think i'm going to be doing it,\" he said.\n\nTrump stressed that the CDC is not calling for Americans wear medical-grade masks.

That's in addition to Arizona's cap of $240.\n\nSunlight does not kill the new coronavirus\n\nApril 1: An article on a holistic health blog that has been circulating on Facebook tells people to go outside to prevent catching the new coronavirus because sunlight kills it.\n\n“In my opinion, keeping the beaches closed and having people quarantined inside their homes is a bad decision. Getting more sunshine is a proactive step we can all take at protecting ourselves from the current coronavirus outbreak,” wrote David Friedman, the author of the blog post.\n\nThe claim has been shared widely on the internet and appeared in a COVID-19 video by Rep.

Families who had left damaged homes lie on a few dozen cots spread across the Sportsplex’s indoor tennis courts.\n\nHill and Wilkins, who live in Germantown, said the home was not damaged but they came to the shelter because they lost electricity. They initially took shelter at the Nashville Farmers’ Market, but then the market also lost power, so they moved to the Sportsplex. On Tuesday morning, their spirits were lifted by a visit from the governor.\n\n“It means a lot to me, at least,” Wilkins said. “You have people who say they are already here to help, but for the governor to actually show up for people who are displaced, it means a lot.\"\n\nHill and Wilkins said they were first notified of the storm by an alert on their phone in Monday night, but soon the weather outside became impossible to ignore. Strong winds were uprooting trees and streets signs and audibly snapping power lines. Tents from a nearby homeless encampment could be seen blowing down the street. Down the street, some entire buildings were leveled, they said.\n\n“If it would’ve touched down just a couple feet further, that would have been us,” Wilkins said.\n\n11:40 a.m. Man moving to Nashville left 'homeless'\n\nLarry Taylor moved to Nashville to live with his relatives on Monday. By Tuesday, he was “homeless.”\n\nTaylor, 58, said he and his wife drove into Middle Tennessee on Monday night on as tornadoes ripped through the state. As the hail fell and the wind roared, their car became trapped in traffic about 50 miles outside of the city.\n\n“The tornado came down the highway, so we saw poles falling and trucks turned over,” Taylor said, “but we couldn’t do anything about it because we had to use the light from the truck in front of us to keep going.\n\nEventually, Taylor and his wife pulled into n the parking lot of a shuttered gas station, then rode out the storm hunkered down in their car. When they finally arrived in Nashville on Tuesday morning, Taylor discovered his sister-in-law’s house – where he planned to live – was damaged to the point of being unlivable.\n\nAs of midday on Monday, Taylor was taking shelter at the Centennial Sportsplex on West Nashville.\n\n“I’m not real comfortable,” Taylor said, “but I’m thanking God for my life.”\n\n10:57 a.m. Governor visits storm-devastated Germantown neighborhood.\n\nAfter visiting the shelter set up at Centennial Sportsplex, Gov. Bill Lee and some Cabinet members walked the streets of Nashville’s Germantown neighborhood to assess damage.\n\nLee walked into a historic home on 7th Ave North, where the roof and entire front wall had been blown off.\n\n“That’s intense,” Lee said as he walked back down the stairs.\n\nIt was the first time he had ever seen such devastating tornado damage “up close,” he said.\n\nLee was then leaving to catch a helicopter to Putnam County.\n\n“Our heart is broken for many families whose lives were changed in an instant,” Lee said in an interview surveying the Germantown damage. “It’s tragic. it’s heartbreaking.”\n\n“We also know there’s great hope in the midst of suffering and difficulty and that’s what we hope we can help provide.\n\n“There are days ahead for Tennessee, post-this tragedy, that will show just who we are as a people.”\n\nEarly that morning Lee had visited both state and local emergency operation centers in Nashville and had been on the phone with the White House and members of Tennessee’s federal delegation in an effort to expedite aid.\n\nLee did not yet have an estimate on how how much federal aid the state would receive or how soon it would be available.\n\n“We know that because of the extent of this disaster there will be aid available,” Lee said.\n\n“What’s encouraging is the coordinated effort,” Lee said. “What’s tragic is what we see right here and what we believe we’ll see more of as the day unfolds.”\n\nThe state has deployed resources to rural areas hard, including sending generators and state troopers. The state is in communication with hospitals in those areas.\n\n“This is the sort of thing where initially government steps in, but the real work will get done by the people of Tennessee as they engage to help one another.”\n\nLee described Tuesday as “a day of assessment.”\n\n“We’ve really just begun to realize the extent of physical damage. We know that there may be even more fatalities as the day unfolds. There are missing persons, there’s search and rescue teams right now underway.”\n\nAs he looked at a crumbled, more than century-old building on the corner of Jefferson Street and 7th Avenue North, Lee talked to a small group of people who knew the owner.\n\nThe black-owned business was home to Music City Cleaners, a dry cleaning service, as well as The Lab, a new coworking space. The building was also used as an event venue.\n\n“It’s a historic structure that’s gone, but what we really see is lives that have been impacted in a negative way. There’s people behind that building. There’s people’s livelihood. There’s businesses. There’s startups.”\n\n10:52 a.m. President Trump says he'll visit Tennessee\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will visit the Nashville area after a deadly storm struck Middle Tennessee on Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he is scheduled to visit Middle Tennessee on Friday.\n\nDetails about the president's visit were not immediately available.\n\n\"We're working with the leaders in Tennessee, including their great Governor Bill Lee, to ensure everything is done properly,\" Trump said while speaking at the National Association of Counties on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our hearts are full of sorrow for the lives that were lost.\"\n\n10:40 a.m. North Nashville residents recount storm terror\n\nAs major portions of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street remained closed around Germantown Tuesday morning, long lines of traffic cams to a standstill on small side streets.\n\nSome residents took it upon themselves to try to direct traffic in the area around 10th Avenue North, where downed trees and power lines blocked streets with no warning to drivers.\n\nDrinking a Smirnoff Ice around 8 a.m. Tuesday, Domonique Hodge recalled hearing the roof come off his 14th Ave. North duplex earlier that morning.\n\n“That’s the roof right there, Hodge said, pointing to a massive pile of shingles and roofing material in the front yard.\n\nHe got in the closet, caught off guard by what was going on outside around him.\n\nAnother woman who lives in the house sat in a folding chair by the side of the road holding a baby wrapped in a blanket.\n\n“What’s there to say?” the woman responded, appearing numb, when approached by a reporter.\n\n10:40 a.m. Significant damage at Robert Churchwell elementary\n\nRobert Churchwell Museum Magnet Elementary School has sustained significant damage from the tornado that touched down in North Nashville on Tuesday morning, according to Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools spokesperson Sean Braisted.\n\nThe district is looking at relocation options for the school, which most likely will be Park Elementary, Braisted said.\n\nThe district is also assessing the damage at Meigs Academic Magnet School, and Lockeland Design Center Elementary School, both located in East Nashville. If class relocation is required, the district will later announce it to families.\n\nMNPS district representatives are consulting with emergency management officials to determine when school will be in session and the district schedule for the remainder of the week. Some schools are still experiencing power outages.\n\n10:30 a.m. Displaced families arrive Centennial Sportsplex storm shelter\n\nAbout 50 people displaced by the storms are now at the Centennial Sportsplex, which was opened as a Red Cross storm shelter.

All are stable.\n\nOne adult is being transferred from Sumner County to main hospital in critical condition.\n\n9:52 a.m. Devastation in north Nashville\n\nThe smell of gas fills the air and downed trees and utility poles block almost every side street in areas of north Nashville and Germantown.\n\nEmergency crews have swarmed the area and are checking for survivors in rubble from collapsed homes along streets including 16th Avenue North and Cockrill Street, where entire homes have been flattened.\n\nKnowles Street off 17th Avenue also has leveled homes.\n\nThe home of George Inmon, who lives on that street, was spared. His neighbors weren’t so lucky.\n\n“We woke up to the sound of a freight train,” Inmon said.\n\nReggie Ingle and Tsan Lozano, who also live on Knowles Street, were trapped on the second floor of their home with their adult son for about seven hours after a large tree fell onto their back porch, and blocked the only entrance into their home.\n\nShortly after daybreak a neighbor emerged with a ladder and helped the family down to safety.\n\n“It’s so good to be on the ground,” Ingle said after his family made it to safety. “We are so thankful to be alive.”\n\nBehind him, a portion of the huge tree rested inside his home.\n\n9:12 a.m. Shattered glass, buildings in East Nashville\n\nNear the corner of 11th and Holly Streets in east Nashville, yellow insulation covered the streets like fall leaves. Outside Fanny’s House of Music saws buzzed as workers boarded up the blown-out windows of the light blue building.\n\nDown the block at Five Points, a wooden telephone pole latched onto the traffic lights and snapped in two the rusted metal of electric wiring dangling into the middle of the road.\n\nAt the intersection of 10th Street and Woodland Avenue, a metal roof from a nearby business dangled across the telephone wires, scraping the ground below every time the wind blew.\n\nOn the corner, the front windows of the popular Burger Up restaurant were shattered, glass strewn across the street. Inside, remarkably, many of the liquor bottles on the shelves behind the bar inside remained in tact.\n\n8:40 a.m. Bridgestone Arena to offer lunch to those impacted\n\n8:15 a.m. Mayor, Governor give updates at live press conference:\n\nGov.

Emergency management personnel confirmed no rescue workers were injured.\n\n\"The reports are just coming in,\" He said. \"These tornadoes struck down in number of places around the state...knowing who is missing and who is not is hard at this point.\"\n\n\"It is heartbreaking,\" Lee said. “We have had loss of life all across the state. Four different counties, as of this morning, had confirmed fatalities.”\n\nLee said he was in touch with the White House this morning \"to ask for assistance.\"\n\nMayor John Cooper said the tornado, which “devastated our community,” was a reminder of how “fragile life is.”\n\nCooper said this morning he had visited with storm survivors at the Nashville farms market.\n\nCooper said firefighters and first responders were examining damaged and collapsed buildings to “ensure all residents are accounted for.” He said “many” Nashvillians remained out of power, and urged residents to avoid downed power lines.\n\n“Frankly, if you can refrain from driving on our roads today, you will help metros cleanup and recovery efforts go further and faster.”\n\nAfter the press conference, Lee planned to visit with people currently at a city shelter set up at Centennial Sportsplex, according to spokesman Gillum Ferguson.\n\n7:57 a.m. Family credits dog with keeping them alert to storm\n\nPreston Bailey’s dog, Theo, arguably saved his family’s life.\n\nThe pup — who hates storms — kept his dad up in Standford Estates until he got an alert on his phone about the tornado.\n\nBailey woke up his soon to be wife Chelsea Ardisson. The couple went into the downstairs laundry room to huddled together with their hedgehog and dogs, but they forgot one pet: their fish.\n\nAfter the storm went by their house, they discovered their first floor was annihilated.

Today's all about planning. Board members have been helpful. We are resilient.\"\n\nDonelson resident Phoebe Collum stood on the pavement outside the school with tears running down her face. The 2015 graduate lives up the street, her house mostly untouched.\n\n\"I have no words,\" she said. \"I got the warning in less than 10 minutes. We huddled and we prayed. Then it was gone.

The Alabama Department of Corrections indicated in an Aug. 2 court filing that it is waiting to make sure the nitrogen hypoxia system is ready before writing procedures for how it will be used. The prison system did not describe how the system would work or give an estimate on when the state may try to use the new execution method. Death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, thereby depriving the subject of oxygen. Lawmakers theorized that death by nitrogen hypoxia could be a simpler and more humane execution method. But critics have likened the untested method to human experimentation. No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out an execution, and no state has developed a protocol for its use, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The information of the construction was disclosed in a court filing involving a lawsuit over the presence of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. State lawyers wrote that they did not yet know if a spiritual advisers could safely be present during an execution via nitrogen hypoxia.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has urged residents to get vaccinated as coronavirus cases spike, driven by the delta variant. “There is a safe, free and widely available tool to put COVID-19 in the rearview mirror,” Dunleavy said in a statement Wednesday. “That tool is the vaccine.” At least 385 state residents’ deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Nearly 53% of eligible Alaskans have been fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Dunleavy has previously urged Alaskans to get vaccinated. But the statement issued last week was more urgent because the state’s spike has been tied to the highly contagious delta coronavirus variant, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Hospitalization numbers have been steady over the past week but are considered high for Alaska, a state with a limited health care infrastructure and hospitals that are already close to capacity during the summer.\n\nArizona\n\nEloy: A small, often overlooked shrub could make a big difference in the rubber industry and change the face of farming in Pinal County, the Casa Grande Dispatch reports. For several years, tiremaker Bridgestone has been researching the native desert shrub guayule on a 300-acre farm in Eloy. The company is about to enter the second phase of its research pilot project, doubling acreage dedicated to the shrub and encouraging other growers to plant it as a crop. Guayule, a perennial woody shrub native to the desert regions of the Southwest and northern Mexico, is a rich source of rubber as well as ethanol, non-toxic adhesives and other materials. Bridgestone Operations Manager Dave Dierig, an expert on the plant and its potential, has spent a career studying guayule, and he focused his doctoral studies on the plant and the materials it can produce. “Lots of plants produce rubber,” Dierig said. “Even sunflowers and lettuce have rubber in them, but it’s not a high-quality rubber. Guayule produces a high-quality rubber that has many uses.” Since 2015, Bridgestone has been producing tires made from guayule-derived natural rubber. “The plant can also be used to make an adhesive and a natural termite pesticide,” Dierig said. “What’s left of the plant after extracting the rubber can be used for biofuel.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge reinstated an attorney’s contract with the state Friday after the state canceled it when he criticized a lawmaker’s support for banning gender-confirming treatments for transgender youths. Chief U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. issued the preliminary injunction in Little Rock that restored Casey Copeland’s contract with the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts. Marshall issued the order verbally after hearing arguments between the state and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, which is litigating the case. Copeland emailed his criticism to Republican state Rep. Charlene Fite, who sponsored the ban enacted earlier this year. A federal judge blocked enforcement of the ban before it took effect July 28 after the ACLU challenged it in court. However, the state canceled Copeland’s contract after Fite forwarded Copeland’s message to Administrative Office of the Courts Director Marty Sullivan. In a statement, Copeland said he was relieved at his reinstatement “so I can get back to work protecting the rights, well-being, and opportunities of Arkansas foster children.” Said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas: “State legislators may not like hearing from constituents who are unhappy with their actions, but they can’t use the power of the state to retaliate.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe: A 14-year-old boy has become the youngest person to swim the entire 21.3-mile length of Lake Tahoe and complete the alpine lake’s coveted Triple Crown. James Savage, of Los Banos, California, completed the trip in 12 hours Aug. 1 when he swam from Camp Richardson in South Lake Tahoe, California, to the Hyatt Regency in Incline Village, Nevada. He earlier completed the other two legs of the Lake Tahoe Triple Crown, all 10 miles or longer. Savage and his mother, Jillian, told the Tahoe Daily Tribune the physical training for the swim was a lot easier than the mental endurance it takes to complete such a long-distance swim. His mother said her only concern was that her son would get bored and decide he wanted to quit. But after the first mile, she was convinced he would get the job done. Last August, at age 13, Savage became the youngest to complete the 12-mile “true width swim.” It’s also known as the “Godfather” swim because it starts at the site of a mansion in Homewood, California, that was used in the movie “The Godfather: Part II.” He also swam the 10-mile Vikingsholm route that traverses the southern portion of the mountain lake.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city’s top public safety leader said he is prepared to discipline police officers, sheriff’s deputies and firefighters who don’t follow the mandate that all city employees get vaccinated against COVID-19, The Denver Post reports. A public health order issued by the city health department last week requires all city employees to receive their second vaccine dose by Sept. 15 and provide proof of vaccination. “I am prepared to do what is necessary to hold people in compliance and hold people accountable,” Murphy Robinson, executive director of the city’s Department of Public Safety, told The Denver Post. “That’s my job.” The Denver police officers’ union said in a statement Thursday that it “respects and trusts our members with their own choices on how to maintain their health, the health of their families and the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Denver.” It’s unclear how many of the Denver’s police officers or emergency responders have been vaccinated, as the city does not keep track. However, the Denver Police Protective Association – which represents a majority of the department’s 1,494 officers – conducted its own poll that showed a total of 778 union members responded, and 43% said they had received vaccines. The union issued a statement Thursday night disputing the validity of its own poll.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s cemeteries continue to suffer from neglect and lack of rule enforcement, according to advocates, families and officials. “Many of Connecticut’s oldest and most historic cemeteries are suffering from severe neglect and are in critical, sometimes desperate, need of care and restoration,” state Historian Walter W. Woodward told the Hartford Courant. A fund for neglected cemeteries was created in 2014 by the Legislature and has been paying towns between $2,000 and $3,300 each year to mow grass and repair gravestones and other features like fencing. The money for the fund comes from death certificate fees and has been fully spent each year, Office of Policy and Management spokesperson Chris McClure told the newspaper. A former board member of the Connecticut Cemetery Association and current volunteer trustee for two cemeteries in Brookfield, Jeff Nolan, wants a state commission to oversee cemeteries and to regionalize and professionalize their management. He suggested using geographic information system mapping to attach the precise location of graves to a person’s vital records. He also said record-keeping for money paid by families of the dead to go toward maintenance is shoddy at many of the cemetery associations that run the state’s 5,000 graveyards.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The University of Delaware is now requiring masks in all indoor facilities, regardless of vaccination status, the school announced Friday afternoon. UD cited rising COVID-19 cases nationwide and the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the impetus for the policy. Delaware State University is also requiring masks in indoor settings. Masks will be required in “common spaces, with limited exceptions, inside all campus buildings, including classrooms, hallways, laboratories, residence halls, and offices,” UD said in an announcement. “In dining areas, masks should be worn except when eating or drinking. Masks are not required inside an individual student’s residence hall room or floor community.” UD and Delaware State University had previously announced that all students would be required to get vaccinated to return to campus. Those who haven’t been – a small number that includes those with religious or medical exemptions – are required at UD to be tested for the coronavirus weekly starting Aug. 15. Delaware State University is requiring vaccinated students on campus to be tested once per week and unvaccinated students twice. Wilmington University also announced an indoor mask requirement last week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Summer Restaurant Week has kicked off despite concerns about the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant, WUSA-TV reports. The weeklong event started Monday and lasts through Sunday. However, restaurants like Taqueria del Barrio in Petworth are feeling the effects of the indoor mask mandate, for which bars and restaurants can be fined if they don’t enforce it. Owner Anna Bran said she lost about 20% of reservations almost overnight. “People are scared to come back out and dine indoors,” she said. Bran said the mask mandate, which came as the restaurant was experiencing nearly pre-pandemic customer volume, has forced her to pause plans for reopening her bar next door. Bran is a cancer patient who said she understands and appreciates the need for implementing mask rules but admitted to being in a tricky position with a business running at a deficit. The event has been a normally lucrative time for participating restaurants, but the pandemic has dwindled turnout for some businesses. Local tourism officials said it is important for people to know D.C. is still very much open. “We’ve come so far, and to be honest, the posture of D.C. doesn’t change: We are open, we are open for everyone that’s coming in,” said Theresa Belpulsi, VP of tourism for Destination DC.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: LIV, one of South Beach’s most glamorous nightclubs, is offering free COVID-19 shots outside the venue where high rollers spend up to $20,000 just for a table. The star-studded nightspot, where Super Bowl champs celebrate at parties so legendary they’ve inspired lyrics from Drake and Kanye West, set up pop-up vaccine sites over the weekend at LIV and club Story to entice the young demographic that is rapidly filling up Florida hospitals as the delta variant of the coronavirus rapidly spreads across Florida. The Sunshine State set another record high over the weekend. On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 23,903 new COVID-19 cases for Friday, topping the previous day’s record of 22,783 new cases. LIV and Story were shuttered for roughly a year during the pandemic and reopened in April. “We are excited, we want to stay open, and we know the only way to make that happen is if people get vaccinated, so we want to make it as accessible as possible,” said owner David Grutman, the king of South Beach’s nightlife scene who also owns a restaurant and hotel with Pharrell. He partnered with CDR Health, which has administered more than 2 million vaccines since the outbreak began, to offer free shots outside the clubs over the weekend, with the possibility of extending it for additional weekends.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Some Savannah-area residents are experiencing delays when they call 911. Chatham County Manager Lee Smith said the emergency call center has about 20 vacancies for operators. A full staff is about 100 operators. “It’s a major problem, but we’re not at a crisis yet,” Smith said. People have said when they call, they sometimes get repeated rings. Former City Council member Julian Miller said he made several calls trying to report a person with medical problems along a city street. “It’s kind of a hopeless feeling when you’re waiting on an ambulance,” Miller said. Miller said the first two calls he made went unanswered for a combined 28 rings. Miller then called a police officer he knew to report the problem. He got a returned call from an automated system, and then the phone rang another 12 times. The county has stepped up recruitment and seen some more applicants. New hires are trained for at least nine months. Trainee pay starts at $13.52 an hour. Pay goes up as training is completed. “Sometimes with private industry, we’re not able to compete at the same level. So it is very tough for local governments,” Smith said. The remaining operators are working 12-hour shifts, but Smith said that’s too long for a stressful job. Managers are seeking ways to shorten shifts and reduce nonemergency calls.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Friday selected a Native Hawaiian prosecutor and former high school teacher for an appeals court judge vacancy after he initially appointed a white man who faced criticism over equitable racial and gender representation on the state’s highest courts. The appointment of Sonja McCullen, a deputy Honolulu prosecuting attorney and former Waianae High School teacher, is subject to state Senate confirmation. McCullen was among six nominees for the Intermediate Court of Appeals on a list submitted to Ige by the state Judicial Selection Commission. Ige initially selected Daniel Gluck, the executive director of the Hawaii Ethics Commission, prompting the House Native Hawaiian Caucus to send Ige a letter saying there are “no native Hawaiian, Filipino, Pacific Islander, or African American judges at the Supreme Court or the ICA.” Some critics said it’s been 30 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals and 20 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the state Supreme Court. McCullen has been a deputy prosecuting attorney for 11 years, most recently in the appellate division, Ige said in a news release announcing her appointment. She previously taught social studies, Hawaiian studies and Hawaiian language, according to the governor’s office.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: The Sun Valley region, a popular ski destination that had one of the highest per capita rates of coronavirus cases in the country at the start of the pandemic last year, is now leading the state – and most of the country – in vaccinating its citizens. Numbers from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare show that more than 87% of Blaine County residents ages 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the Idaho Press reports. Eighty percent of the county’s residents are fully vaccinated, which puts the county in the top 10 among more than 3,000 counties nationwide, according to healthdata.gov. That’s far higher than Idaho’s statewide average of about 50%. The nationwide average reached 70% last week. “Blaine County has shown a remarkable willingness to work together as a community,” said Brianna Bodily, public information officer for South Central Public Health District, the health authority for Blaine and seven other counties, including Twin Falls. “They understand that this disease impacts all of them, so they make efforts together to unite against COVID-19. Vaccination is just one of many things that they have done.” Blaine County is home to resort towns Ketchum, Bellevue, Hailey and Sun Valley. Out-of-state travelers brought the virus to the ski destination in early 2020.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After essentially disappearing from the state, the osprey is making a comeback thanks to a decades­long effort to eliminate harmful pesticides and provide safe places for the large, slender hawks to nest. The raptors remain a threatened species in Illinois. But 14 nesting pairs settled this season in platforms placed on top of tall poles throughout the Cook County Forest Preserve District, the Chicago Tribune reports. The district placed the platforms in areas to resemble the birds’ preferred treetop nesting habitat and now has 20 sites around the county. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has a similar effort across the state. Three of Cook County’s 14 nests were lost when tornadoes hit parts of the Chicago area earlier this summer. But generally, there has been a slow and steady increase in occupied platforms and nesting pairs in recent decades. Experts say it’s due largely to the removal to environmental toxins like DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 that thinned the shells of the raptors’ eggs, making it nearly impossible for offspring to survive. “It can take a bird that’s basically everywhere and does really great under most circumstances and take it to the brink,” said Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the Field Museum. “And it also shows that we can change that.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will fund a $1.3 million distribution of the opioid reversal agent naloxone to ensure the medication reaches Hoosiers who are at risk of drug overdoses, officials announced. Overdose Lifeline Inc., an Indiana nonprofit that helps those affected by substance use disorder, will distribute 35,000 doses of naloxone to first responders, families, friends and others who are likely to be the first on the scene if someone overdoses. Funds were made available by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration state opioid response grant. This is the state’s third investment in naloxone distribution since May 2020, when Holcomb announced the state would earmark $1 million for 25,000 doses of the medication amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Each dose of naloxone represents another life that could be saved and another opportunity to engage individuals with substance use disorder in treatment,” Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement Thursday. “The effects of COVID-19 continue to linger, and now more than ever we must make treatments like naloxone readily available to any Hoosier who may encounter an individual experiencing an overdose.” Indiana reported a 33% increase in fatal overdoses in 2020, according to provisional data released in July by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Ahead of Thursday’s Major League Baseball game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site, fans have flocked to the town in record numbers. The New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox, two historic franchises featured in the film, will play in the first official MLB game in Iowa history on a specially built field right next to the diamond featured in the movie. James Earl Jones’ character sketches a vision for farmer Ray Kinsella, played by Kevin Costner, of a mystical baseball field built out of Iowa cornfields that will lure people who are seeking to reconnect with childhood memories of baseball and are yearning for simpler times. “People will come, Ray,” Jones says. And they have, baseball fans and movie buffs alike. The game had an immediate impact on Dyersville the moment it was announced back in 2019. The phone at the Super 8 by Wyndham rang nonstop. The Plaza Antique Mall has seen business pick way up. Karla Thompson, executive director of the Dyersville Area Chamber of Commerce, said other businesses, including boutiques and home decor stores, have benefited, too, as national media outlets have done stories on the town. “We were up to 120% just on the website views and hits,” Thompson said. “That was back in June.”\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: An outbreak of illness at a splash park near Wichita was not caused by animals at its interactive zoo, health officials said. The Wichita Eagle reports that email exchanges it obtained through an open records request indicate none of the water samples health officials took from the splash park at Tanganyika Wildlife Park had animal-linked contamination. The newspaper reviewed more than a month of email correspondence between state and county health officials and park director Matt Fouts with details about the results of water samples taken June 19 and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Christine Steward, deputy health director with the Sedgwick County Health Department, sent Fouts an email July 8 saying the organisms isolated from water samples “help us rule out the animals at the park.” Health officials have said eight people who visited the park June 11 contracted Shigella, a type of bacteria that spreads from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces. People who visited the splash park also have tested positive for the norovirus, sapovirus and a type of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli. The splash park was allowed to reopen July 27 after it made necessary changes and passed inspection.\n\nKentucky\n\nFancy Farm: Two Republicans expected to compete to lead their party’s ticket in 2023 took turns Saturday accusing the Democratic governor of infringing on individual liberties with his pandemic-related restrictions, pressing GOP themes on the stage of the state’s premiere political event. Speaking at the Fancy Farm picnic – attended only by Republican elected officials and candidates this year – Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles and state Auditor Mike Harmon accused Gov. Andy Beshear of overreaching with his now-lifted restrictions on businesses and gatherings to try to contain COVID-19. The attacks against Beshear’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a crisis that has spanned most of his term, came as Kentucky faces its worst outbreak in months, fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Republican speakers didn’t talk about the resurgence, instead repudiating Beshear’s executive actions. The governor has said his decisions saved lives. With virus cases soaring to the highest levels in months, Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman skipped the picnic. Western Kentucky’s Graves County, where the picnic is held, is in the red zone for COVID-19 cases, signaling a severe level of community spread. Beshear didn’t respond directly Saturday but said in a statement that the focus should be on getting more Kentuckians vaccinated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: City officials are eyeing a closed golf course as a floodwater detention area, but the owner says he doesn’t want to sell. The city-parish announced Friday that the Louisiana Watershed Initiative had awarded it $6 million to buy 65 acres of the former Sherwood Forest Golf Course. Paired with $3.27 million in local funding, the city-parish said it would buy the land, dig out parts to hold water from Jones Creek when it floods, and possibly use the land as a park. The city-parish has been buying vacant land to use for stormwater detention after flooding in 2016 that caused widespread damage in southeast Louisiana. “This project is another example of the aggressive approach my administration is taking to address drainage throughout the parish,” Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome said in a statement. But Randy Dornier, whose family controls a company that owns the land, told WAFB-TV he doesn’t want to sell. “If I really thought this was the solution to the 2016-type flooding, I’d have to bow out and say it’s for the good of the community, but I know it’s not,” Dornier said. Instead, he said he wants to restore the golf course. In 2019, a developer proposed building a 276-home subdivision on the course, a move opposed by residents of the older neighborhood surrounding the property.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A brick smokestack that pumped out molasses-scented steam for decades is coming down. Visible from Interstate 295, the nearly 150-foot smokestack has long been a symbol of the B&M baked beans factory, but it hasn’t been used for more than 20 years. The Portland Press Herald reports crews began removing it Friday, and the rest is expected to come down by the end of the month. Burnham & Morrill Co. opened in Portland in 1867 as a food cannery to package meat, vegetables and fish. It began making baked beans in the 1920s and is now owned by B&G Foods, which includes Green Giant and Crisco among its brands. The trademark smell of molasses from the cooking beans now emerges from an exhaust stack on the other side of the factory.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Comptroller Peter Franchot outlined a plan Monday to increase equity and inclusion for Black residents as part of his campaign for governor, including a pledge to name a Black woman as his running mate. Franchot, a Democrat, announced he would create a Cabinet-level office called the Secretary of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to review state policies. The secretary would release a report on promoting diversity in government, addressing existing biases in government policies and promoting economic opportunity. If recreational marijuana is legalized in a ballot initiative, the comptroller said he would focus on ensuring it would help economic growth in areas of the state disproportionately affected by enforcement for cannabis-related offenses and addresses past criminal justice inequities. Franchot also noted plans to explore creating a state-owned bank to ensure access to credit for Maryland small businesses, particularly those owned by women and members of minority groups. Another part of the proposal would seek to provide state-backed mortgage loans to people in communities of color with a goal of creating parity in new homeownership rates by the end of his first term. Franchot is running in a crowded Democratic primary for next year’s election.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital crippled by a nurses’ strike that’s now entering its sixth month says it has hired more than 100 replacement nurses after talks aimed at ending the standoff stalled. St. Vincent Hospital said in a statement Sunday that it planned to post more jobs in the coming days. “Saint Vincent must take responsible action and hire as many nurses as possible to maintain access to ensure core services, as COVID numbers increase and the cooler weather approaches,” it said. Hospital officials accused the Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents the 700 striking nurses, of “minimal interest or intention to end the strike.” The nurses, who have been on strike since March 8, are seeking staffing increases at the Worcester hospital owned by Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare. Union spokesperson David Schildmeier questioned whether the hospital has really hired replacement workers. In an email to The Boston Globe, he said: “Tenet has spent in excess of $100 million to force and prolong this strike to avoid accountability for providing the level of care patients of Worcester expect and deserve.” Management at St. Vincent’s Hospital on Thursday presented what they called their “last, best and final” offer. The union promptly criticized it as an “unsatisfactory ultimatum.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Childhood vaccination rates have dropped below 70% in more than half of the state’s counties, and health and school officials are advising parents to catch their kids up on immunizations before school starts in the coming weeks. Michigan’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Joneigh Khaldun and other health and school officials spoke Monday about the need to catch students up on regular immunizations, as well as COVID-19 vaccinations for those who are 12 and older. Seven counties and the city of Detroit have childhood immunization rates that have dropped below 60% during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry. When an area has lower vaccination rates, it creates an environment where diseases can spread, Khaldun said. “All it takes is one infected individual. So as families, students, teachers and administrators, prepare for this upcoming school year, I urge every parent, to make sure their child is up to date on all of their vaccinations,” Khaldun said. East Lansing School Board President Terah Chambers said that on top of requiring face masks indoors, parents must make sure their kids get all their vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine if eligible, in order to move forward with the goal of in-person instruction every day of the school year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than a year after George Floyd’s death sparked a failed push to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department, activists and several City Council members are trying again, with a well-funded initiative that would ask voters in November whether the department – disparaged by critics for what they say is an enduring culture of brutality – should be dismantled. In its place would be a public safety department that employs a “comprehensive public health approach” and licensed peace officers “if necessary.” The new department would no longer be under the sole command of the mayor’s office, which is significant given that incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey opposes abolishing the police department, while a majority of City Council members supports the idea. More than 30 local groups are pushing for change under the “Yes 4 Minneapolis” banner. They gathered 20,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot – almost twice the number necessary – and have raised about $1 million, including $500,000 from Open Society Policy Center, which has ties to billionaire George Soros. “What we knew as public safety – which is only the police right now, the only option that we have – was unacceptable,” said Brian Fullman, lead organizer with one of the groups, Barbershop and Black Congregation Cooperative.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s top public health official said Monday that as coronavirus cases continue to surge with the highly contagious delta variant, no intensive care beds were available in 35 of Mississippi’s top-level hospitals. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs also said more than 200 people were waiting in hospital emergency rooms to be admitted, and the problem will grow worse in coming days. The wait times affect not only people with COVID-19 but also those with other health conditions. The state Health Department said Monday that more than 6,900 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed from Friday through Sunday. “Keep in mind – this will translate into around 500 new hospitalizations in coming days,” Dobbs wrote on Twitter. He said the intensive care units were full in Level 1, 2 and 3 hospitals in the state’s acute care systems. Those include the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo, Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg, Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, and Singing River Health System in Pascagoula. Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation. As of Friday, the state Health Department said 35% of residents were fully vaccinated, compared to 50% nationally.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The head of St. Louis County’s government on Monday urged its council to adopt a mask mandate amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The request from St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, comes after a judge last week issued an order that, at least temporarily, halted a mask requirement for indoor public places that Page had announced last month. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt then sued to stop it after the County Council voted to overturn it. A hearing on a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Aug. 17. Page said during a news conference that Missouri’s largest county, with about 1 million residents, is now averaging 311 new COVID-19 cases each day – six times the number from two months ago. Data from St. Louis regional hospitals shows 493 patients are hospitalized with the virus, compared with 93 hospitalizations in June. The County Council meets Tuesday, and Page urged passage of a mask requirement, a move that would make the court case moot. Schmitt’s lawsuit argued that Missouri law gives the council the authority to terminate the requirement. Page said the council’s vote in July “has brought confusion, anxiety and anger.” Noting that children under 12 can’t get COVID-19 shots, he also lamented that “we are seeing younger people in our ICUs.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Hunting this fall could be largely shaped by the widespread drought hitting the state this summer, from potential access closures to impacts on wildlife fitness and location. While some early hunts start in August, Montana’s hunting season really begins in earnest Sept. 4 with the start of the six-week archery season. On Oct. 23 general season kicks off for five weeks, ending the Sunday after Thanksgiving. And, new for this year, traditional muzzleloader hunters will have their own nine-day season to chase elk and deer in December. Most big game herds fared pretty well following a mild winter by Montana standards. Cold snaps remained relatively short-lived with little lower-elevation snow. And hunter success hovered around average levels in most parts of the state. Persistent drought this summer affected green-up, with many areas of Montana reporting stifled grass growth. That can mean less nutrition for elk, deer and other wildlife, the Montana State News Bureau reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A group of doctors who are also moms is urging schools to consider requiring masks this fall as the number of coronavirus cases surges across the state. The group has about 700 members statewide who work in a variety of different medical specialties, said Dr. Christine Mitchell, an Omaha-area internal medicine specialist who is involved in the effort. “This virus changes. The pandemic changes. And we have to change our policies with it,” she said. “Now it’s time that we make the restrictions again, put the masks on and see if we can keep school going all year, just like we did last year.” Nebraska virus cases have been increasing for six straight weeks as the highly contagious delta variant continues to spread. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has more than doubled, going from 139.71 cases per day July 24 to 374.14 per day Saturday. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he believes schools should not require masks or COVID-19 vaccinations this school year despite recent recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics that say all students and staff should wear masks in school, even if they are inoculated.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Metro officials on Saturday announced plans for transit improvements, including new and restored services, following cutbacks during the pandemic. Henderson Mayor Debra March, chairwoman of the Regional Transportation Commission, said officials were “thrilled to celebrate the services that we’re bringing back and adding to our community thanks to federal stimulus funding.” The enhancements announced Saturday and taking effect Sunday include faster and more regular service for busy stops along Charleston Boulevard and weekend services in underserved areas. There also will be a pilot microtransit service in parts of the Las Vegas metro area.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An off-the-grid hermit known to locals as “River Dave,” whose cabin burned down on the wooded property where he was squatting for 27 years, says he’s grateful and overwhelmed by fundraising efforts and offers for a place to live. “I feel about as good as I ever have in my life,” David Lidstone, 81, said Sunday, saying he has many friends. “I live down there in the woods because I like being alone, being away from people, so this publicity is not anything that I’m used to at all.” Lidstone lived in the woods along the Merrimack River in the town of Canterbury. He was jailed July 15 on a civil contempt sanction and told he’d be released if he agreed to leave the cabin. The property owner, 86-year-old Leonard Giles, wanted Lidstone off the land. A fire destroyed the cabin Wednesday, hours after Lidstone defended himself during a court hearing. He was released from jail Thursday after a judge ruled that he would have less incentive to return to “this particular place in the woods” since the cabin had burned down. The state fire marshal’s office is investigating the fire. Lidstone had said a prior owner gave his word years ago that he could live there, but he had nothing in writing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: An amendment to Megan’s Law that tightens the rules on who can seek to be removed from a sex offender registry can’t be applied retroactively to crimes committed before the amendment was passed, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday. The case involved a man, identified by the initials J.D.-F., who was working as a manager at a McDonald’s in Hillsborough in 2001 when he was accused of improperly touching two teenage boys who worked there. He was convicted in December 2002 of criminal sexual contact and child endangerment and sentenced to time in the county jail and probation. Under Megan’s Law, he was required to publicly register with law enforcement as a sex offender. The law allows offenders to apply to be removed from the list if they are offense-free for 15 years and no longer considered a safety threat to others. Earlier in 2002, between when J.D.-F’s crimes were committed and his conviction, the Legislature had amended Megan’s Law to prohibit those convicted of certain offenses or of more than one offense from applying to end their registration requirements. After J.D.-F applied for removal from the registry in 2019, a trial court and, subsequently, an appeals court had denied his request on the grounds that the amendment was passed before he was convicted.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The governor and dozens of other elected officials are urging the state’s business community to require that employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 or alternatively undergo regular testing. Those steps are necessary to stop the increased spread of the coronavirus as infections increase, according to the letter released Friday and sent to employers and business groups. The 28 signers include Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham., U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich, and U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fernandez and Melanie Stansbury but not U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell, the congressional delegation’s sole Republican member. “Requiring vaccination of your workforce – and/or requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test of the patrons who visit and support your business – is within your right as an employer,” the letter said. “Implementing that sort of policy to help New Mexico finally end this pandemic is within your power as a community leader.” New Mexico state employees are required to be vaccinated or get tested regularly. The elected officials’ letter cited increased cases and hospitalizations. “In short, the pandemic is not over,” the letter said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dave Chappelle, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Amy Schumer are part of a star-studded group of comedians that will perform for one night only at Madison Square Garden to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11. All proceeds from “NYC Still Rising After 20 Years: A Comedy Celebration” will benefit 9/11 charities. Proof of vaccination against COVID-19 is required. “We wanted to put on a fun celebration to honor this great city’s resilience. It’s nice to be able to do this with friends and people we love,” Stewart said in a statement. The show is his brainchild with “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who will also perform. A ticket presale for the Sept. 12 show begins at noon Wednesday on Live Nation, Ticketmaster.com and Madison Square Garden’s website and runs until 10 p.m. Thursday, with general tickets on sale starting at noon Friday at Ticketmaster.com. Bill Burr, Colin Jost, Colin Quinn, Dave Attell, Jay Pharoah, John Mulaney, Michael Che, Ronny Chieng, Tom Segura and Wanda Sykes are also in the lineup.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One of the state’s most vaccinated areas is again compelling people to wear masks at indoor public spaces. Durham’s city and countywide emergency order, which took effect at 5 p.m. Monday, is the latest effort to combat the rapid spread of the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. In a Monday morning news conference, Durham Mayor Steve Schewel said it’s time to go “back to the basics” in order to combat what he now views as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” “Face masks are a common-sense, non-economically damaging way of limiting transmission,” Schewel said. In all but two of North Carolina’s 100 counties, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal mask-wearing for both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans. But at a time when nearly all available COVID-19 metrics showed spread of the virus at its worst levels in months, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper decided to let his statewide mask mandate expire July 30 and allow local school boards to set their own masking policies. Spread of the virus has only continued to surge since then, prompting some experts to fear an uptick in transmission within the dozens of school districts that have made masking optional for all K-12 students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Wildlife managers say predictions of a poor duck breeding season in the state due to drought have proven true, and hunters should expect challenging conditions this fall. The number of duck broods, or families, observed during the state Game and Fish Department’s annual mid-July survey was the lowest in nearly three decades. This year’s fall duck flight is expected to be down 36% from last year, according to Mike Szymanski, the agency’s migratory game bird management supervisor. “Hunters should take advantage of early migrants like blue-winged teal during the first two weeks of the season,” Szymanski said. “We won’t be able to depend on local duck production to the extent that we have in the past.” The news was not unexpected, the Bismarck Tribune reports. More than half of North Dakota is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories, while all of the state is in some form of drought. In past dry years, some areas still remained wet, but “there’s nothing like that this year,” Szymanski said. “It’s all dry.” The National Weather Service expects that drought will persist into the fall. Some areas of North Dakota have seen improvements, but rainfall continues to be hit-and-miss. The regular duck season opens Sept. 25 for resident hunters and Oct. 2 for nonresidents.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A man will face a charge of causing a panic after his actions prompted a panicked rush out of a mall movie theater over the weekend, authorities said. Columbus police said Sunday that, contrary to earlier reports, no shots were fired, and in fact no weapon of any kind was involved. Sgt. James Fuqua said a man walked into the Easton Town Center movie theater just before 9 p.m. Saturday – just before the end of a showing of “Suicide Squad” – and began screaming “that he was the king,” accompanied by “many obscenities.” Fuqua said the man then ran to top of theater and, still screaming obscenities, started to reach into his bag – and that sent everyone else racing for the exits, even jumping over railings to reach them, in fear that he had a weapon of some kind. Fuqua said officers working special duty at the mall rushed inside and restrained the man without incident. The man, who refused to give his name but has since been identified, will face a charge of “inducing panic,” police said. Fuqua said the incorrect reports of shots fired stemmed from shouts of young people rushing out of the theater. Some people sustained minor injuries in the flight from the theater, he said. “We don’t want the citizens of the city to feel that it is unsafe to go to any shopping mall here,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s already burgeoning movie and television industry – with buzzy projects like new Hulu series “Reservation Dogs” and upcoming fact-based Martin Scorsese epic film “Killers of the Flower Moon” – is about to get a big boost. To go along with the ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 608, which created the Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021, Gov. Kevin Stitt issued a proclamation Aug. 3 declaring it “Film Day” in the Sooner State. But Oklahoma will really get into its next phase of cinematic action Tuesday, when film and television projects can begin applying for production tax incentives through the new $30 million program designed to create a more robust entertainment industry for the state. The application portal will available on the Oklahoma Film + Music Office website at okfilmmusic.org. Passed by the Legislature and signed by Stitt in May, the act increases the state’s total film incentive cap and eligibility threshold to host major motion pictures and television series. It creates a new rebate program of $30 million per fiscal year for 10 years, a significant boost that proponents of Oklahoma’s film and television industry say will bring in more productions, which means more jobs and economic activity for the state.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Authorities say a man was fatally shot on a TriMet bus Sunday evening. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Sunday’s shooting marks the 56th homicide in Portland this year, making 2021 the city’s deadliest year since 1994, when 55 people were killed during the entire year. Officers responded to the area in southeast Portland just before 5:30 p.m. and found a man who had been shot. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he died from his wounds, police said. TriMet spokesperson Tia York said the agency is providing the police bureau with security footage from Sunday’s incident.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A man has pleaded guilty to leaving a backpack containing homemade explosive devices in a bush outside a complex in the downtown area during last year’s protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Matthew Michanowicz, 53, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to possession of an unregistered destructive device. Authorities said he was seen on surveillance video placing the military-style backpack near a bike rack under some trees at PNC Plaza on May 31, 2020. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Smolar said it contained three improvised explosive devices filled with gasoline, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Authorities said Michanowicz originally told them he had gone to the area to see the property damage that occurred during the protests but initially denied any knowledge of the backpack. Sentencing for Michanowicz, who was originally charged with arson and possessing weapons of mass destruction, is scheduled for Dec. 13.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Communities and organizations across the state are eligible to apply for a portion of $3 million in matching grants to protect valuable green space, according to the state Department of Environmental Management. Funding provided through the 2016 Green Economy Bond and the 2018 Green Economy and Clean Water Bond – which Rhode Island voters approved by a margin of almost 80% last November – is capitalizing the grants. Awards up to $400,000, which may cover up to half of the project cost, will help preserve lands that offer significant natural, ecological or agricultural value by direct purchase or conservation easement. In addition to the grants, funding is available to cover some costs associated with appraisal, title and survey services. The application deadline is Oct. 29.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalterboro: A prosecutor is using a federal grant to expand a program that can let nonviolent criminals who are veterans or addicted to drugs avoid prison. The 14th Judicial Circuit’s Multidisciplinary Court program is expanding from Beaufort County into Colleton and Jasper counties, Solicitor Duffie Stone said in a statement. The program allows veterans whose problems in military service like post-traumatic stress disorder or people with drug problems to seek help. They have to plead guilty, but their sentences aren’t carried out unless they don’t complete the program, Stone said. The people sent to Multidisciplinary Court after pleading guilty have to get drug addiction or mental health treatment, have random drug tests and home visits, pay restitution for their crimes, and perform community service. They also appear before one of the court’s judges regularly to report how they are doing and answer questions. The expansion is being paid for through a $740,000 federal grant. In applying for the money, prosecutors said drugs are the root of about half of the 5,000 cases they deal with every year in the five-county circuit, when related crimes like burglaries are included. The program is much less expensive than prison, and it gives people convicted of minor crimes a second chance, Stone said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: Police say the upward trend of domestic incident calls reported in the middle of COVID-19 lockdowns last year is continuing to manifest itself in 2021. Police Chief Jason Foote said Yankton police answered a total of 292 domestics in 2020, up more than 50 from the year before and something he believes “could be due to issues associated with COVID.” Midway through this year, the city has fielded 180 such calls, the Yankton Press and Dakotan reports. Nationwide, domestic violence reports rose sharply when the pandemic arrived. “I can’t say that there a specific factor to the increase, but I believe COVID has caused tension during this time, but this is not the only factor,” Foote said. “Making the public aware of domestic violence and that it should not be tolerated could be a factor in the increased calls for service getting law enforcement to intervene before things turn to physical assault.” In that respect, the number of cases being referred to the state’s attorney office is trending downward, Foote said. He said the police department continues to work with its community partners such as the River City Domestic Violence Center to help tackle the problem, and the public can also play its part in addressing what is an ongoing issue.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Southwest Tennessee Community College has forgiven $1.8million in school debt for 1,600 of its recent students, the college announced Monday. The community college cleared the balances for eligible students enrolled during the spring, summer and fall semesters of 2020, using federal emergency relief funding. “Our students were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and many of them had to leave college abruptly,” Dr. Tracy D. Hall, president of the college, said in a statement. “Wiping the slate clean clears a path for them to come back and move forward with their goals and career aspirations.” Forgiving the debt is a step toward giving students financially affected by the pandemic “a fresh start” for their college education. Students do not have to repay the funds, the college reiterated. “Earning a college credential is transformative for our students and removing this financial barrier to their success is the best use of COVID-19 relief funds,” Hall said. “We are truly grateful and elated to be able to help our students in such a meaningful way.” Last fall, the college experienced an enrollment dip of 24%, the greatest drop of any community college in the state. The fall semester begins Aug. 23. Masks are required indoors for students, faculty, staff and visitors.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Travis County state district judge has signed a temporary restraining order blocking the arrest of any quorum-busting Texas House member, paving the way for those who remain out of the state to return home without that threat. State District Judge Brad Urrutia signed a three-page order late Sunday that was filed Monday in Travis County District Court. It came at the request of 19 House Democrats who said in a 24-page lawsuit that their arrests would rely on a misinterpretation of the state Constitution and House rules and give the “government power to arrest its political opponents.” The application for the restraining order includes affidavits from Reps. Gina Hinojosa of Austin, Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio and Jasmine Crockett of Dallas. In his order, Urrutia blocked Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, from “detaining, confining, or otherwise restricting a Texas House Democrat’s movement without his or her consent.” It also bans those Republicans from “issuing any warrant or other instruments” that would cause the Democrats to be detained or confined. The order also applies to the House sergeant-at-arms, the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Rangers, Capitol police and other law enforcement agencies. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for later this month.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: Three weeks after graffiti laden with Nazi symbols, codes and slogans appeared in a Logan High School parking lot, the local police investigation appears to have stalled. “The case is still open, but at this point, there’s not new information coming in,” Logan City Police Department Capt. Curtis Hooley told the Herald Journal. Investigators could see figures in the parking lot, Hooley said, but no identifying features. Requests for information from residents have so far likewise failed to turn up identifying details. “We put out a Facebook request of citizens if they live down in that area if they have any footage from their doorbell cameras and things, and officers tried to make contact with people down there,” Hooley said, “but we have not come up with anything. We’ve had no information that has come forward to help us to try to identify who those people might have been.” Surveillance footage shows figures in the parking lot just before midnight July 13, Hooley said. Area resident Chris McGinty said he discovered the graffiti the next morning, took a photo, and spread it to news and social media in the hopes of starting productive conversations about the expression of hate and racism.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: The state’s busiest Amtrak station could be getting a $3.5 million facelift with the help of a federal appropriation. The Essex Junction station is much as it was when it was built in the 1950s, and it’s showing its age. “It’d be really hard to understand why this station here that receives 20,000 or so individuals over the year isn’t treated with better respect,” said Essex Junction Village President Andrew Brown. MyNBC5 reports the improvements to the Essex Junction station would include upgraded restrooms, more seating and bike racks. David Carle, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, said the Vermont Democrat has been working for years to find funding to renovate the station. A request for $3 million for the Essex Junction station is pending in Congress.\n\nVirginia\n\nEttrick: Four buildings at a historically Black university that were named for white men with links to the Jim Crow era or to the Confederacy have been renamed for Black women. Virginia State University announced the new names Friday, five months after the original names were taken down, with replacement names considered by a committee. “It wasn’t hard, and we didn’t have to look far to find women who embody our mission today,” Tonya Hall, VSU’s vice president of external relations, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Vawter Hall, originally named for a Confederate captain, was renamed for Lula Johnson, believed to be the first woman to graduate from a Virginia public college in the 1890s, from what is now VSU. Byrd Hall, a dorm named for former governor and U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr., is now Otelia Howard Hall, honoring a school English teacher in the 1920s and ’30s. The former Trinkle Hall is now named for Johnella Jackson, who wrote the music for VSU’s alma mater in the 1920s. Elbert Lee Trinkle was governor in the 1920s and signed a law that prohibited interracial marriage. And Eggleston Hall, named for Joseph Eggleston, a board of visitors member in the early 20th century, is now named for Lucretia Campbell, the faculty’s first Black female member.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Most state workers, as well as private health care and long-term care employees, will be required to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs, Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday. Weekly coronavirus testing will not be an option for those who want to avoid vaccination and maintain their employment, and the only way to opt out of the requirement is a medical or religious exemption. The order applies to about 60,000 employees of the 24 state agencies that are part of the governor’s executive Cabinet, which includes the departments of corrections, social and health services and transportation, as well as the Washington State Patrol. A fact sheet issued to employees notes that the order applies to employees who are currently working remotely, since they may need to go to a work site at some point. The governor’s office said the overall number includes those who have already been vaccinated, so it was unclear how many within that group are unvaccinated. Inslee’s announcement appears to be the most stringent among states that have issued vaccination requirements for state or health care workers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office will hold two auctions for unclaimed property at the State Fair this month. The auctions will take place at 5 p.m. Aug. 14 and Aug. 21 in Fairlea, the office said in a news release. Among the items up for bid are rare coins, currency, jewelry and other collectibles. They will be on display throughout the fair at the treasurer’s office booth located in the West Virginia Building at the fairgrounds. Banks and law enforcement officials turn over the items to the office’s Unclaimed Property Division when lawful owners cannot be located. Proceeds from the auction remain in an individual’s name for claim in the future. “These items are often forgotten about or left abandoned,” state Treasurer Riley Moore said. “These auctions help convert these collectibles into the highest cash value possible for someone to claim in the future. They’re also a treasure trove for collectors.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday that he has given hotels $70 million in federal coronavirus relief dollars. The governor’s office said grants of up to $2 million went out Friday to 888 lodging businesses around the state to help offset pandemic-related losses. The money is part of $140 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars designated for Wisconsin’s tourism and entertainment industries, including $11.25 million for movie theaters; $12 million for live-event small businesses; $2.8 million for minor league sports teams; $1 million to help the Wisconsin Historical Society reopen historical sites; and $8 million for summer camps. The lodging industry supported more than 157,000 jobs across Wisconsin and had a $17.3 billion impact on the state economy last year despite the pandemic. So far this year, the industry’s numbers have surpassed 2020 as travelers start taking vacations again, the governor’s office said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the first time in nearly six years, Powder River Basin coal producers are reporting increased production, lower costs and profitable mines. The 6% increase in production for the first half of 2021 for the basin’s 12 Campbell County mines – going from 101.85 million tons through the first half of 2020 to 107.9 million this year – isn’t enough to be considered a trend, jump or leap. But as the nation’s economy continues to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic that’s lingered for nearly 18 months, it’s a welcome reprieve from the 22.5% decline thermal coal saw last year. With natural gas prices also rising above $4 and the pandemic rebound, it was expected there would be more of a leveling off for a beleaguered thermal coal industry, said Robert Godby, a leading energy economist and interim dean of the University of Wyoming College of Business. “This is exactly what we expected,” he told the Gillette News Record. “As the economy recovers, we knew this was coming. But even (to this level) has kind of surprised us. Originally, we though it might be a one-year jump and then moderate, but now it’s looking like coal could maintain this pump through a good chunk of next year.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/10"}]}

The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.\n\nDonald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.\n\nTrump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\nLitigator in chief\n\nIn addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\nThe actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\n\nTrump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn’t paid fully, the Trumps said, it’s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work.\n\n“Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.”\n\nTo be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties.\n\nHowever, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump’s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn’t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases.\n\nIn the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were “a long time ago.” However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump’s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn’t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment.\n\n“Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that’s their M.O.” said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. “They’re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?”\n\nSimilar cases have cropped up with Trump’s facilities in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers. Trump's company settled the California case, and the New York case is pending.\n\nTrump's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company’s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn’t paid.\n\nJuan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump’s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene.\n\nIn courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump “already paid enough.” As the construction manager spoke, “Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact” with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling.\n\nThat, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot’s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump’s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues.\n\nEnriquez still hasn’t been paid.\n\nTrump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. “No matter who you are, we're going to protect your job,” Trump said Tuesday. “Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies.”\n\nBut the lawsuits show Trump’s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes.\n\nIn 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.\n\nMar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records.\n\nDevelopers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees.\n\n“Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don’t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,” she said, stressing she couldn’t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump’s record. “But there are a few.”\n\nIn the interview, Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. “We pay everybody what they’re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,” he said. “And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?”\n\nDespite the Trumps’ assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors “when somebody does a bad job,” he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It’s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren’t likely to offer to rehire them.\n\nNevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family’s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump.\n\n“He sat in a room with nine guys,” Paul Friel said. “We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.”\n\nIn the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company’s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn't get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future.\n\n“Wait a minute,” Paul Friel said, recalling his family's reaction to his dad’s account of the meeting. “Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?”\n\nAsked about the meeting this week, Trump said, “Was the work bad? Was it bad work?” And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, “Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?”\n\nIvanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month.\n\n“We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.”\n\nBut, the Friels’ story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.\n\nA half-decade after the Friels’ encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump’s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino’s trademark minarets.\n\nOne of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump.\n\nRosenberg’s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support.\n\n“Yes, there were a lot of other companies,\" he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. \"Yes, some did not survive.\"\n\nRosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full.\n\nThe analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he's refused to pay them sizable sums of money. Those cases show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him until they’re not.\n\nReal estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate “based on nothing more than whimsy.”\n\nTrump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies.\n\nHowever, Williams' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn't the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn't get fully paid. “There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn’t come,” she testified. “That was both for myself and for some of the agents.”\n\nAnother broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274.\n\nEven Trump’s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills.\n\nOne law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City’s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn’t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club.\n\nAs Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn’t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump's senior deputies attacked the attorneys' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds.\n\nTrump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren’t paid by him haven’t been as fortunate.\n\nEdward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they’d recover.\n\nThe unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. “The worst part wasn’t dealing with the Trumps,” Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. “There’s tons of these stories out there,” he said.\n\nThe Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5, 1989.\n\nSays the founder's grandson: “Trump hits everybody.”\n\nContributing: John Kelly, Nick Penzenstadler, Karen Yi, David McKay Wilson\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/entertainment/kanye-west-hitler-album/index.html", "title": "Kanye West has a disturbing history of admiring Hitler, sources tell ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSeveral people who were once close to the artist formerly known as Kanye West told CNN that he has long been fascinated by Adolf Hitler — and once wanted to name an album after the Nazi leader.\n\nA business executive who worked for West, who now goes by Ye, told CNN that the artist created a hostile work environment, in part through his “obsession” with Hitler.\n\n“He would praise Hitler by saying how incredible it was that he was able to accumulate so much power and would talk about all the great things he and the Nazi Party achieved for the German people,” the individual told CNN.\n\nThe executive left his position and reached a settlement with West and some of his companies over workplace complaints, including harassment, which CNN has reviewed. The former executive asked not to be named due to a confidentiality agreement and fear of retribution by West. According to the agreement, West denied the executive’s allegations.\n\nThe executive told CNN that West spoke openly about reading “Mein Kampf,” Hitler’s 1925 autobiographical manifesto and expressed his “admiration” for the Nazis and Hitler for their use of propaganda.\n\nThis individual stated that people in West’s inner circle were “fully aware” of his interest in Hitler. Four sources told CNN that West had originally suggested the title “Hitler” for his 2018 album that eventually released as “Ye.” They did not want to be named, citing concern for professional retribution.\n\nCNN has reached out to West for comment.\n\nUniversal Music Group, owner of Def Jam, which used to distribute West’s music, said in a statement to CNN Tuesday that the company’s relationship with his GOOD Music label ended last year.\n\n“There is no place for antisemitism in our society. We are deeply committed to combating antisemitism and every other form of prejudice,” Universal Music group added.\n\nThe sources CNN spoke with did not have information about why the album was ultimately called “Ye.”\n\nVan Lathan Jr., a former TMZ employee, who confronted West during his 2018 interview at their offices in which West said slavery “sounds like a choice,” recently claimed on a podcast that West also made antisemitic comments during their conversation that the outlet did not release publicly. That’s why Lathan said his current comments didn’t surprise him.\n\n“I already heard him say that stuff before at TMZ,” Lathan said during an episode of the “Higher Learning” podcast earlier this month. “I mean, I was taken aback because that type of antisemitic talk is disgusting. It’s like, I’m taken aback any time anyone does that, right? But as far as [West], I knew that that was in him because when he came to TMZ, he said that stuff and they took it out of the interview. … He said something like, ‘I love Hitler, I love Nazis.’ Something to that effect when he was there. And they took it out of the interview for whatever reason. It wasn’t my decision.”\n\nKanye West at TMZ's offices in 2018. TMZ\n\nOne of the sources who spoke to CNN and was at the TMZ interview said West had favorably referenced Hitler.\n\nCNN has reached out to TMZ for comment.\n\nThe revelation of West’s alleged history of admiring Hitler comes amid a wave of inflammatory actions by West that began earlier this month. He wore a “White Lives Matter” shirt during his Yeezy fashion show in Paris on Oct. 3 and dressed several Black models in clothing with the phrase, deemed a hate slogan by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). He then posted a private text conversation on Instagram between himself and Sean “Diddy” Combs in which he claimed Combs was “controlled by Jewish people.” He followed that with a tweet in which he said he would go “death con 3 on Jewish people,” resulting in Twitter locking his account.\n\nWest’s offensive rhetoric in the last few weeks has resulted in a professional fallout for the rapper and designer. Tuesday, Adidas ended its seven-year partnership with West, calling his recent actions “unacceptable, hateful and dangerous.”\n\nIn a statement, the sportswear maker said it “does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech” and said that West’s recent comments violated the company’s “values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.”\n\nBalenciaga also cut ties with West, as has talent agency CAA. Production company MRC stated they were shelving a documentary on West, and GAP announced the company would remove Yeezy Gap merchandise from its stores and shut down the YeezyGap.com website.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Thursday captioned “LOVE SPEECH,” West appeared to reference the severed business relationships, writing, in part, “I LOST 2 BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE DAY AND I’M STILL ALIVE.”\n\nWest was referenced in banners raised by antisemitic demonstrators in Los Angeles last weekend. His comments have been condemned by the American Jewish Committee and the ADL, as well as numerous political leaders and celebrities, including his former wife, Kim Kardashian.", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/trump-deposition-ny-attorney-general/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump invokes Fifth Amendment rights but swipes at New ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and declined to answer questions from the New York attorney general at a scheduled deposition Wednesday.\n\n“Under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution,” Trump said in a statement that was released to the public.\n\nTrump was to be deposed by lawyers from New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office as part of a more than three-year civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization misled lenders, insurers and tax authorities by providing them misleading financial statements.\n\nIn a separate two-page statement Trump read during the deposition that was obtained by CNN on Thursday, he criticized James, who was in the room, calling her a “renegade prosecutor” running a “vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.”\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Trump was angry at the start of the deposition and the mood was tense. But once the questioning began, with the state attorneys saying he could repeat the “same answer,” the atmosphere turned professional and cordial.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social earlier Wednesday morning that he would be “seeing” James “for a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history! My great company, and myself, are being attacked from all sides. Banana Republic!”\n\nThe scheduled deposition comes during an extraordinary legal week for the former President. On Monday, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, his primary residence in Florida, in connection with an investigation into the handling of classified documents. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court denied his long-running effort to block a House committee from obtaining his tax returns.\n\nSome Trump advisers had advocated that the former President answer questions since he previously testified about his financial statements under oath, while others warned him against providing any answers because of the potential legal jeopardy he may face, people familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Manhattan district attorney has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the Trump Organization.\n\nAnother consideration that had been discussed, the people familiar say, is the political implications of not answering questions as Trump is widely expected to announce that he will run for president in 2024. While campaigning in 2016, Trump suggested not answering questions was a sign of guilt. At a campaign stop in Iowa in 2016, Trump said, “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”\n\nIn his statement Wednesday, Trump said, “Now I know the answer to that question” and decried James’ investigation. The former President and the Trump Organization have previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\n'They even broke into my safe': Trump responds to search of his Mar-a-Lago home 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\n“When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice,” the former President stated.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual cannot be compelled by the government to provide information that might be incriminating against themselves. When an individual declines to answer a question by “taking the Fifth,” he or she invokes that right. It is not an admission of guilt.\n\n“No person shall … be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” the Fifth Amendment states.\n\nIn a statement, the attorney general’s office confirmed that Trump took the Fifth and said it will continue to investigate.\n\n“While we will not comment on specific details, we can confirm that today, our office conducted a deposition of former president Donald Trump,” the office said. “Attorney General Letitia James took part in the deposition during which Mr. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Our investigation continues.”\n\nThe mood was tense at the outset of the deposition, but later turned cordial and professional, Trump attorney Ronald Fischetti told CNN. Fischetti was present along with co-counsel Alina Habba, a New Jersey-based attorney who has taken over many of Trump’s ongoing lawsuits.\n\nJames, a Democrat, attended the first half of the deposition and made a standard statement about the sworn testimony.\n\nAt the outset, Fischetti explained that Trump wanted to testify “very badly,” but that the former President had accepted his advice not to answer questions.\n\nUnder oath, Trump confirmed that he wanted to testify but he would not answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Much of his statement used similar language to the public statement he released earlier Wednesday, referencing a “witch hunt” and the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAssistant New York Attorney General Kevin Wallace squared off against Trump, flanked by 10 assistant attorneys general who handed him notes during the interview. The questions focused on valuations placed on various Trump properties that were included in the financial statements, according to Fischetti.\n\nWhen questioned during the roughly four-hour deposition – not counting breaks – Trump repeatedly said “same answer” when declining to respond by pleading the Fifth.\n\nJames left at the lunch break and Trump shook her hand as she was leaving. At the end of the day, when Trump left, he shook the hands of all of the state attorneys, Fischetti said.\n\nInvestigation and previous depositions\n\nIn January, James’ office said it found “significant” evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. The attorney general’s civil investigation is nearing the end and a decision over an enforcement action may come soon.\n\nThe showdown follows Trump’s failed attempt to block subpoenas for depositions from him and his children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump’s deposition took place last week and Trump Jr. had his deposition in late July, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump did not assert their Fifth Amendment rights and answered the state’s questions, the people said. It is not clear what they were specifically asked or what they said.\n\nTheir decision breaks with Eric Trump and former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who both asserted their Fifth Amendment rights more than 500 times when deposed in 2020.\n\nTrump has testified under oath in civil lawsuits over the past decades and since leaving office he has also been deposed. Last year he provided videotaped testimony for a lawsuit involving an assault outside of Trump Tower. The case is set to go to trial in the fall. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nQuestions about Trump’s net worth\n\nTrump has been questioned about the accuracy of his net worth and financial statements in previous lawsuits, something some advisers say is one reason why he should answer questions in the current investigation.\n\nIn a 2007 deposition in a defamation lawsuit, Trump once said he calculated his net worth, to a degree, on his “feelings,” and that he put the “best spin” on some of the assets. “I think everybody” exaggerates about the value of their properties, he testified, adding: “Who wouldn’t?”\n\nDid he inflate values? “Not beyond reason,” Trump said.\n\nMichael Cohen on how Trump would inflate property values 04:12 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the past Trump has tried to push responsibility for his valuation decisions onto Weisselberg, while at the same time, documents and depositions appear to show that, even as Trump claimed that he left those valuation decisions to others, he was also deeply involved in running his business.\n\nTrump said in the 2007 deposition that the only person he dealt with in preparing the statements of financial condition was Weisselberg.\n\n“I would give my opinion,” Trump said in the deposition. “We’ll talk about it,” he said, adding that “ultimately” and “predominately” it was Weisselberg who came up with the final values, which Trump said he viewed as “conservative.”\n\nWhen questioned specifically about swings in values from one year to the next Trump had ready explanations.\n\nDuring the deposition, Trump was questioned over the family compound in Westchester County, New York, called Seven Springs where its value nearly doubled in one year from $80 million in 2005 to $150 million in 2006.\n\n“The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very – it just has gone up,” Trump said.\n\nHe was asked if he had any basis for that view, other than his own opinion.\n\n“I don’t believe so, no,” he said.\n\nIn addition to Weisselberg, two others involved in the preparation of the financial statements, Jeff McConney, the Trump Organization’s controller, and Donald Bender, the real estate firm’s external accountant, have both been interviewed by the attorney general’s office and Manhattan district attorney.\n\nTrump’s lawyers are likely to argue that the financial statements were not audited so anyone relying on them would be on notice. The financial statements reviewed by CNN show they have numerous disclosures indicating that they did not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, none of the lenders lost money on the transactions, which could make it harder to allege that they were defrauded or misled.\n\nThe appraisals underlying the property values were in many cases provided by Trump’s longtime appraiser Cushman & Wakefield, which is also under investigation. Cushman, which broke ties with Trump after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, has denied any wrongdoing and stands by its work.\n\nLegal risks to Trump\n\nThe depositions pose significant legal risks to the Trumps.\n\nIf Trump is sued by James and the case goes to trial, the jury can draw an “adverse inference” against him for not answering questions, which could result in a higher judgment against him if he’s found liable. If he answers questions, it could open the door to potential civil and criminal liability.\n\nThe criminal investigation, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, has slowed but not stopped. Earlier this year, Bragg would not authorize prosecutors to present evidence before a state grand jury after raising concerns about the strength of the case, CNN has reported. A special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg told CNN in an interview in April: “Anytime you have a parallel civil, criminal investigation, if there’s testimony in that proceeding, obviously we will look at it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/", "title": "Exclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential ...", "text": "Nick Penzenstadler, and Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is a fighter, famous for legal skirmishes over everything from his golf courses to his tax bills to Trump University. But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/02/25/autism-centria-grant-governor-race-calley/336524002/", "title": "Autism firm awarded grant after Lt. Gov. Brian Calley's endorsement", "text": "Centria Healthcare, the autism therapy provider under investigation for Medicaid fraud, has been among the most generous political donors to Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who backed the company's successful bid for an $8-million state grant.\n\nCalley, a longtime advocate for autism therapy and the father of an autistic daughter, publicly urged the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to approve Centria's grant request to expand in Michigan. Five weeks later, a key investor and board member of the company hosted a party at his Orchard Lake mansion that formally launched Calley's gubernatorial campaign, the Free Press has learned.\n\nAbout 200 people attended, sipping wine and cocktails and enjoying strolling appetizers from Andiamo's. Guests contributed $106,400 to Calley, campaign financial reports show.\n\nThe host, Mark Mitchell, was entangled in his own medical fraud case that lasted years, according to federal court records. In 2009, Visiting Physicians Association, a company he owned and ran, agreed to repay the federal government $9.5 million to settle claims of overbilling.\n\nRead more:\n\nMore:Centria Healthcare accused of fraud, targeting poor in metro Detroit\n\nMore:Autism therapy provider's $8 million state grant on hold amid investigation\n\nIn a recent interview with the Free Press, Calley insists he didn't know about Mitchell's history with Visiting Physicians and said his advocacy for Centria's $8-million grant stemmed from his desire to expand access to autism services in Michigan.\n\n\"The company didn’t ask me to look into it, to check into it, to weigh in on it,\" Calley told the Free Press when asked about whether he saw a conflict between the grant and the launch party.\n\n\"When I saw it on the agenda, I decided that it was because we are so short on autism providers that the idea of using economic development dollars to not just make sure that a big and growing company has their headquarters here, but also that more kids with autism would get services. … I think it's a great use of economic dollars meeting a huge social need at the same time as doing economic development.”\n\nMitchell hosted the party, which cost more than $21,000, according to campaign finance reports. A statement to the Free Press said the allegations made by former Centria employees \"lack any credibility.\" The allegations include fraud and forgery. The statement went on to say the settlement in the Visiting Physicians case included \"no admission of liability or wrongdoing of any kind.\"\n\nFour whistle-blowers who alerted the government to that case, received about $1.7 million, the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release, regarding the civil case.\n\n\"This settlement illustrates the government's commitment to pursuing those who defraud Medicare and other important programs and drive up the costs of health care,\" then-U.S. assistant attorney general Tony West said in a statement at the time.\n\nMitchell declined interview requests and the statement failed to address specific written questions about Visiting Physicians or about his relationship with Calley.\n\nAn ethics expert said candidates must be mindful of perceptions.\n\n\"It's always problematic when policy and politics, in this case, fund-raising, coincide because it raises the appearance of impropriety,\" said Hana Callaghan, director of government ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California. Callaghan said there's no indication laws were broken, but: \"Public officials also have a duty to preserve a trust in government.\"\n\nCraig Mauger, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, a watchdog group, cautioned against drawing conclusions because the public is not privy to all that went into making the decisions, including all the conversations. Still, voters should always be mindful who is contributing, he said.\n\n“This an example of a situation where you have a large donor, a large group of donors, and you have a public action that the state is taking that they could benefit from,” Mauger said.\n\nSpreading the wealth\n\nAccusations against Centria have prompted an investigation by the office of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, Calley's chief rival for the Republican nomination for governor.\n\nCentria executives were generous to Schuette as well.\n\nEight days after Calley's party, they hosted a fund-raiser for Schuette at a Birmingham bistro, raising $34,500. About $20,000 of that came from Centria employees, according to campaign statements.\n\nIn total, Centria executives, employees, family members and others associated with the company have contributed more than $62,876 to Calley, about three-quarters of their political donations toward the gubernatorial race, records show.\n\nCompany CEO Scott Barry and President Chris Wilcox each have contributed $6,800, the maximum allowed, to both Calley and Schuette.\n\n\"They were two of a handful of people who had given max contributions to multiple candidates for governor,\" said Mauger of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network.\n\nCentria-affiliated contributors gave $5,000 to the leading Democratic candidate for governor, Gretchen Whitmer, records show. Schuette told his campaign to return the roughly $20,000 in Centria contributions earlier this month, spokeswoman Andrea Bitely said.\n\n\"Upon the public disclosure by the Detroit Free Press of the open investigation by the department, the campaign notified me that they had returned the dollars contributed by Centria employees,\" Bitely said Thursday.\n\nShe said the campaign notified the department the money had been returned as of Feb. 13.\n\nBarry said that Centria is politically active, noting company officials also have met with Whitmer.\n\nWhitmer toured Centria's office Dec. 11 and spoke to staffers, a spokeswoman said, adding Whitmer has met with a variety of organizations across the state during the campaign.\n\n\"We have given time and attention to all three candidates because regardless of who becomes the next governor, Centria will still be serving children with autism in the state of Michigan and creating jobs in the state of Michigan,\" Barry said. \"And autism is a nonpartisan issue.”\n\nCentria accused\n\nCentria is now at the center of a legal battle with former employees who accuse the company of Medicaid fraud, forgery, violating patient privacy and employing unqualified staffers, according to court records.\n\nThe company denies the accusations and has sued the former employees, including its ex-chief compliance officer Vanessa Pawlak, for defamation. The allegations first became public when Centria included them in pleadings filed in Oakland County.\n\nPawlak has sued Centria, claiming wrongful termination and former senior sales executive Curtis Moore has sued under the Whistleblower Protection Act. Moore also is accused of perjury for his testimony in a separate Centria case. He's accused of lying under oath about whether he signed a noncompete agreement when he joined the company.\n\nThe Free Press has been investigating Centria since November, when it began interviewing former executives and other former employees concerning allegations of improper billing and other business practices of the company. The newspaper has examined thousands of internal and public documents related to Centria and also has spoken to former employees not connected with those involved in lawsuits.\n\nCentria has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the allegations are deliberately false. In a statement to the Free Press, Mitchell said the allegations are from \"disgruntled former employees, lacking any concrete evidence of wrongdoing on Centria’s part.\"\n\nFormed in 2009, Centria has grown into Michigan's largest provider of autism therapy services. Last year, it served more than 3,500 clients in nine states.\n\nThe market for autism therapy boomed in 2012 when Michigan passed a law requiring health insurers to pay for it. Calley signed the bill into law, with the approval of Gov. Rick Snyder, who was out of the state at the time.\n\nCalley commended the company for the work it has done.\n\n\"They have made a very, very big difference in the lives of so many people with autism,\" he said.\n\nHe also said the Centria allegations are being taken seriously.\n\n\"There’s a process for this and I expect the process will be very, very vigorous and very, very thorough and I will have no connection in any way, shape or form whatsoever to it,\" Calley said.\n\n$8-million state grant\n\nIn October, the Michigan Strategic Fund, an economic development arm of the state, awarded Centria an $8-million state grant, contingent on creating 1,200 new jobs over five years. The company is moving its headquarters from Novi to Farmington Hills.\n\n\"I had never seen … the economic development agency support autism services before, and I just think there's so much growth that is needed in our state so that kids get services that it's something I really wanted to support,\" Calley told the Free Press earlier this month after a town hall meeting in Troy.\n\nThe state has not paid the grant money yet and a contract to formalize it remains unsigned.\n\n\"At this time, the contract signing process is on hold pending the results of an ongoing investigation by the Attorney General’s Office,\" Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) spokesman Otie McKinley told the Free Press.\n\nCalley and his office were told of the project just days before the vote on the grant was scheduled, Jeff Mason, CEO of the MEDC, said in an e-mail.\n\nMEDC communication staffers invited Calley to speak at its October meeting: \"Not only due to the magnitude of the project, but also due to his personal passion toward the diagnosis and treatment of autism.\"\n\nMason said he is not aware of any communications between Calley and any of the grant decision makers, beyond Calley's public comments at the board meeting.\n\nCentria went through the MEDC vetting process for the grant, but neither Mitchell nor his venture capital firm, Lorient Capital, were examined during that initial review, officials said.\n\nThat vetting process — which remains ongoing — found the whistle-blower lawsuit involving Moore in Oakland County, according to records obtained by the Free Press. An attorney for Centria provided the MEDC with an explanation, saying “Centria believes these allegations are meritless” and were filed in retaliation for two lawsuits filed against him by Centria.\n\nCentria Subsidiary Holdings was identified as the sole member entity of Centria Healthcare during the vetting process, McKinley said.\n\nLorient Capital of Birmingham, a private investment firm focused on health care, lists on its website Centria Autism Services as part of its investment portfolio.\n\nBarry told the Free Press that Mitchell is a board member of Centria and part of an investment group.\n\nMitchell wouldn’t answer questions about his role at Centria or his stake in the company. Records show he contributed $6,800 to Calley's campaign, the maximum amount. The statement released by his spokesman Michael Layne said Mitchell doesn't discuss his investments \"which are confidential and nonpublic.\"\n\nBut public documents, including his divorce filing, show his investments made him wealthy enough to own multiple homes, a yacht, luxury vehicles including a Ferrari, and flights on a private jet. Mitchell sold his majority interest in U.S. Medical Management, a management company for Visiting Physicians, for $200 million in 2013, court records show.\n\nRed flags\n\nPawlak was hired as Centria's chief compliance officer in November 2016 and said she saw red flags with the company almost immediately. E-mails reviewed by the Free Press show her alerting Barry and other top officials to her concerns.\n\nFormer execs accuse Centria Healthcare of fraud\n\nShe was fired two months after joining the company and recently sued for wrongful termination. Barry said she was terminated for improperly sending sensitive company information to her personal e-mail account.\n\nPawlak said she suspected her days at Centria were numbered when work e-mails began disappearing from her inbox. Two days later, she was asked to meet with Mitchell, not at the company headquarters in Novi, but at his Lorient Capital office in downtown Birmingham.\n\nWhen Pawlak walked into a conference room there, she saw Mitchell sitting with Centria's lawyer, Michelle Carter Pierce.\n\n\"He said 'I think you know why you're here,' \" Pawlak recalled. \"We're prepared to offer you a sum of money if we can be friendly on the street.\"\n\nPawlak said she was asked to sign a separation agreement but refused.\n\nMitchell is not active in day-to-day management of the company, but he, along with counsel, fired Pawlak at Barry's request, the CEO said.\n\n\"He did not make the determination that she should be fired or that she should be hired,\" Barry said. \"He merely assisted in the conversation after the decision was made for a policy violation.\"\n\nCentria contributions\n\nAs the legal cases play out in court, and the Attorney General's Office continues its investigation, the candidates for governor prepare for the Aug. 7 primary election.\n\nWhile Schuette said he has returned contributions from Centria employees, Whitmer and Calley don't share the same level of concern about contributions they've received.\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Annie Ellison said Whitmer has \"built support from a large, broad, in-state coalition of people … it's not surprising that people who work for major employers across Michigan are part of that broad, in-state coalition.\"\n\nCalley hasn't returned any contributions from people connected to Centria, campaign spokesman Mike Schrimpf said. Calley has no role in the company's audits or investigations and the company faces allegations, not findings, he said.\n\n\"I don’t think it’s right to just assume an allegation equals guilty,\" Calley said. \"And I also don’t want to discount the profound impact that (autism therapy) services have had on the lives of thousands of people that didn’t have access to it before.\"\n\nContact John Wisely: 313-222-6825 or jwisely@freepress.com.

Adidas said it will take a €250 million hit ($246 million) to its fourth quarter sales.\n\nAdidas has partnered with West since 2013, when the company signed his brand away from rival Nike. In 2016, Adidas expanded its relationship with the rapper, calling it “the most significant partnership ever created between a non-athlete and an athletic brand.”\n\nBut Adidas put the “partnership under review” in early October after he wore a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt in public. The Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a “hate slogan” used by White supremacist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nRecently, Ye said “I can say antisemitic s*** and Adidas cannot drop me,” during a tirade against Jews on the Drink Champs Podcast. He also threatened on Twitter to “Go death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.”\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said Adidas’ decision is a “very positive outcome.”\n\n“It illustrates that antisemitism is unacceptable and creates consequences. Without a doubt, Adidas has done the right thing by cutting ties with Ye after his vicious antisemitic rants,” he said in a statement. “In the end, Adidas’ action sends a powerful message that antisemitism and bigotry have no place in society.”\n\nHe added on CNN earlier Tuesday that he wish it happened sooner, but Adidas “has made a very strong statement of putting people over profits.”\n\nShares of Adidas (ADDDF) fell as much as 5% in Frankfurt. Adidas (ADDDF) said it will release additional information about the financial implications of dissolving its partnership with Ye in its upcoming earnings report on November 9.\n\nBrands cut ties\n\nThe list of brands distancing themselves from West is growing. Balenciaga and Vogue publicly cut ties last week, and on Monday, talent agency CAA dropped West as a client. Production company MRC said that it’s shelving a documentary on West.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Gap announced it was removing Yeezy Gap merchandise from its stores and has shut down YeezyGap.com.\n\n“Our former partner’s recent remarks and behavior further underscore why. We are taking immediate steps to remove Yeezy Gap product, ” the retailer said in a statement.\n\nLast month, the rapper said he was ending his rocky two-year relationship with the Gap, citing “substantial noncompliance.” Ye said he was left “no choice but to terminate their collaboration,” alleging the company didn’t open branded Yeezy stores and distribute his merchandise as planned, his lawyer said in a statement.\n\nThe saga of Ye, not just with Adidas but with brands like Gap and Balenciaga, “underlines the importance of vetting celebrities thoroughly and avoiding those who are overly controversial or unstable,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData in a note Tuesday.\n\n“Although there is room for some tension in fashion, this must never cross the line of decency and basic respect for humanity. Companies or brands that fail to heed this will get stung, especially if they become overly reliant on a difficult personality to drive their business,” he added.\n\n– CNN Business’ Parija Kavilanz and Jon Sarlin contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/02/03/25-really-weird-lawsuits-you-wouldnt-believe-were-ever-filed/41083385/", "title": "Law and disorder: These are the 25 of the weirdest lawsuits ever filed", "text": "John Harrington and Hristina Byrnes\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nRemember Stella Liebeck who was burned by a hot McDonald’s coffee and was awarded $2.9 million? For a long time, she was the poster girl for ridiculous lawsuits. The case shocked the world at the time, but frivolous lawsuits have become common since then.\n\nIn today's litigious environment, some cases stand out because they are so absurd. 24/7 Tempo searched online archives of various news sites to find 25 examples.\n\nLiving in a country with a well-established judicial system offers an opportunity to use the courts to achieve justice for whatever wrongs people see. While most cases have merit, sometimes the wrongs being sued are not what most people would consider to be unjust. The downside is that some such lawsuits end up being material for late-night comedians.\n\nFrom a kidnapper suing his victims for failing to help him escape the authorities to people suing for being misled that a sugary snack has a lot of sugar, there are many bizarre lawsuits that many may not believe are real. You be the judge of whether they have merit.\n\nShould you hire a tax preparer?:Look out for these 4 red flags\n\nTax season 2020:How long will it take to get my tax refund this year?\n\nTo identify some of the weirdest lawsuits filed in recent history, 24/7 Tempo searched online news archives of various sites, including CNN, Reuters, and NBC. We selected lawsuits that stemmed from what most people would describe as minor inconveniences.\n\nSome of the cases on the list concern marketing claims that have been taken either out of context or too literally. Others are just bizarre, and most people would think they are not even real.\n\nMan wants to legally change his age\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nA 69-year-old Dutchman wanted to legally change his age in order to avoid ageism. Emile Ratelband claimed he felt discriminated against because his real age was affecting his job prospects as well as his chances of success on Tinder, a popular dating app. The judge explained that many rights and obligations are age-based, and that changing the legal age could cause many complications.\n\nWoman shocked jelly beans contain sugar\n\n• Year: 2017\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nSugar has 61 different names, so it stands to reason that some people may not recognize the ingredient when reading nutrition labels. This happened to a California woman, who sued jelly beans maker Jelly Belly for using the term \"evaporated cane juice\" instead of the word \"sugar\" in its jelly beans' food label. Jessica Gomez of San Bernadino County alleged fraud, claiming the company was misleading consumers about how much sugar the snack actually contained – even though the total grams of sugar per serving was clearly displayed. The case was dismissed.\n\nMan sues date for being on her phone\n\n• Year: 2017\n\n• Result: Lawsuit dropped\n\nMany people have a story about a date gone wrong, but most would forget about the whole ordeal as soon as it was over. A 37-year-old from Austin, Texas, however, could not let go of his bad experience and sued his date. He was so offended that his date spent the time they were at the movies watching \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2\" texting on her phone. He claimed her behavior was breaking theater rules and affected his movie-watching experience. She agreed to pay him the $17.31 for her cinema ticket, if he left her alone. Soon after he withdrew the lawsuit.\n\nFootlong sandwich is not a foot long\n\n• Year: 2016\n\n• Result: Case was settled\n\nIt started in 2013, when a teenager measured his Subway footlong sandwich. It turned out to be only 11 inches, an inch too short. Fast forward three years, and the company was settling a class-action lawsuit in court, promising to make its rolls 12 inches. The only people to benefit from the lawsuit were the attorneys, who were about to receive $520,000 in fees. The judge agreed with activist and legal writer Theodore Frank that this was not fair and dismissed the settlement and the entire case.\n\nEmpty space in Junior Mints boxes\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nBiola Daniel and Abel Duran of New York and Trekeela Perkins from Mississippi believed Tootsie Roll Industries Inc tricked people by underfilling Junior Mints boxes. They sued the company because more than a third of the mints' box was empty. The judge who dismissed the case wrote in a 44-page decision that a reasonable customer can expect some empty space.\n\nCustomers disappointed that Red Bull did not energize them\n\n• Year: 2016\n\n• Result: Settled out of court\n\nRed Bull's famous slogan \"Red Bull gives you wings\" got the company in some trouble. A class-action lawsuit accused the company of having misleading ads and making false claims. Plaintiffs said the energy drink did not give people wings, even figuratively speaking, that is, they didn't feel energized. They said the company lacked evidence to claim the beverage could improve one's focus. Red Bull settled out of court and agreed to pay $640,000.\n\nIs firefighter's fear of fire a disability?\n\n• Year: 2014\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nShayn Proler from the Houston Fire Department is afraid of fire. He was reassigned to an office position so he would not have to come in direct contact with what scared him, but he wanted to remain in his former job in the fire suppression unit. He claimed his fear was a disability and that he was discriminated against because of his disability. His case made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled there was no evidence Proler was discriminated against on account of a disability.\n\nDipping into your savings?:44% of Americans are equipped to pay a tax bill with savings\n\nKidnapper sues hostages for escaping\n\n• Year: 2012\n\n• Result: Lawsuit dismissed\n\nJesse Dimmick, a fugitive facing a murder charge, kidnapped a Kansas couple in September 2009. At some point he fell asleep and they escaped. They sued Dimmick for over $75,000 in damages. His response was to countersue for breach of contract. He claimed he and the couple had a legally binding oral agreement for them to hide him from the police. His case was dismissed.\n\nSame price for a burger with and without cheese\n\n• Year: 2018\n\n• Result: Lawsuit dismissed\n\nTwo McDonald's customers from Florida sued the fast-food chain for $5 million because they were made to pay for a Quarter Pounder sandwich without cheese the same price as the sandwich with cheese (the difference is about 30 cents). A judge dismissed the case with prejudice, which means they can't file the suit again. The basis for the dismissal was that the plaintiffs could not prove the price they had to pay caused them any harm.\n\nHusband sues wife over 'ugly' baby\n\n• Year: 2012\n\n• Result: Plaintiff won\n\nBoy meets a pretty girl, boy marries the girl; they have kids. One similar tale did not have such a happy ending, however. Jian Feng from China saw his newborn daughter, who, he said, was \"incredibly ugly\" and did not look like either parent. He accused his wife of cheating on him. At that point, she admitted she had several plastic surgeries before they had met. He sued on the grounds of false pretenses, claiming she misled him by hiding her cosmetic history. He won the case, and his wife was made to pay him more than $120,000.\n\nWoman blames 'scary' poster on falling\n\n• Year: 2015\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nA woman from New York said she fell down the stairs at the Grand Central subway station, injuring her foot and ankle, after seeing an oversized \"scary\" poster for the popular Showtime series \"Dexter.\" The poster showed the face of the main character under a plastic wrap with his eyes open. She claimed it was \"disturbing, provocative, shocking and fear inducing.\" The judge disagreed, dismissing the case, saying the network was under no obligation to maintain the stairs at the station or that it created a dangerous condition.\n\nDrinking beer does not make fantasies come true?\n\n• Year: 1993\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nBeer commercials often feature beaches and good-looking men and women having fun. Most people understand this is not real, but not Richard Overton. In 1993, he sued Anheuser-Busch for $10,000 for false advertising. He claimed the beer ad caused him emotional distress, mental injury, and financial loss. Overton said the company's ads showed beer's ability to enable \"scenic tropical settings [and] beautiful women and men engaged in unrestricted merriment\" when this was actually not the case. He lost the suit.\n\nLawsuit over using just 75% of lip balm tube\n\n• Year: 2016\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nYou can't get that last bit of lip balm out of the tube unless you scrape it out. While this has been true since lip balms have been sold in tubes, a California woman filed a lawsuit alleging consumers were conned into thinking they could reach the bottom with their lips when they can actually use just about 75% of the product. The court disagreed that Fresh Inc., the company being sued, tried to lie about the real quantity of its lip balm and that a reasonable consumer understands how such dispenser tubes work.\n\nMan sues Michael Jordan for looking too much like him\n\n• Year: 2006\n\n• Result: Lawsuit dropped\n\nMany people would be happy if they looked like a celebrity, unless that celebrity was as famous and loved as Michael Jordan. Allen Ray Heckard from Portland sued the basketball legend and Nike for promoting Jordan for more than $800 million. He claims he has been confused for Jordan every day in the last 15 years, and that it has caused him permanent injury and emotional pain and suffering. Heckard later dropped the charges without giving a reason.\n\nMan sues himself for $5 million\n\n• Year: 1995\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nPrison inmate Robert Lee Brock is nothing if not creative. Brock, serving time for breaking and entering at the Indian Creek Correctional Center in Virginia, sued himself for $5 million, claiming that he violated his religious beliefs and got himself arrested. And since he has no income because he is in jail, Brock asked the state to pay as he was a ward of the state. The judge dismissed the case.\n\nChicken sandwich out of stock\n\n• Year: 2019\n\n• Result: Trial pending\n\nA Tennessee man sued fast food chain Popeyes Louisiana Chicken for $5,000 for running out of its famous chicken sandwich because, he claimed, the restaurant wasted his time trying to fill his order. Craig Barr said the company deceptively advertised the sandwich, which was only available for a limited time in August. Barr is also suing for damages to his car that he said occurred at the restaurant's parking lot. The case was scheduled to go to court in January.\n\nToo much ice in Starbucks drinks\n\n• Year: 2016\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nCalifornia resident Alexander Forouzesh threatened a class action against Starbucks, saying customers who ordered cold drinks from the beverage giant received less liquid in their cups than advertised because of too much ice. A district judge put the case on ice. He ruled that even kids know ice in a cup reduces the amount of liquid they get, and customers can also clearly see the amount of ice in a clear cup and ask for less ice.\n\nMan claims Uber ruined his marriage\n\n• Year: 2017\n\n• Result: Unknown\n\nA French businessman sued Uber for $48 million, claiming that a flaw in the ride-sharing company's app played a role in the dissolution of his marriage. The businessman said he borrowed his wife's cell phone and used it to log on to the Uber app. He claimed a glitch in the app caused it to continue to send notifications of his whereabouts to his wife's phone even after he logged off, and apparently some of his movements caused a problem with wife and their marriage ended in divorce. The result of the suit is unknown.\n\nBanks, Bitcoin, bond funds:Where is your money safe in an era of cyberattacks?\n\nMom confiscates son's phone\n\n• Year: 2017\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nA 15-year-old boy in Spain sued his mother, claiming he was mistreated after she took his cellphone to try and get him to study. He also sought jail time for his mom and reimbursement for his legal expenses. A judge ruled in favor of the mother, saying she was within her rights and acted responsibly to get her son to crack the books.\n\nTrespassers sue property owners\n\n• Year: 2002\n\n• Result: Plaintiff won\n\nA federal jury awarded two men a total of $24.2 million for getting severely burned by electrical wires when they were teenagers trespassing on railroad property in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 2002. Attorneys for Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Corp. claimed the two men, aged 17 at the time of the accident, were old enough to know that they were putting themselves in danger. The plaintiffs' lawyer, while conceding his clients were trespassers, said the property owners were still responsible.\n\nMan sues dry cleaners breaking 'Satisfaction Guaranteed' promise\n\n• Year: 2007\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nA court ruled against the dissatisfied customer of a Washington, D.C. dry cleaner – who sued the dry cleaner for $54 million for allegedly misplacing his pants – and ordered him to pay the company its legal fees. The customer, administrative law judge Roy Pearson, also could not prove the store lost his pants. Pearson's suit was based on the claim that the store's sign said \"Satisfaction Guaranteed.\" The case drew national attention as well as sympathy for the defendants, who received funds online for their defense.\n\nCity of Batman vs. Superhero Batman\n\n• Year: 2008\n\n• Result: Lawsuit never filed\n\nHoly litigation! In a story worthy of Gotham City tabloids, the mayor of Batman, the name of an oil-producing city in southeastern Turkey, said he would sue Warner Bros. and movie director Christopher Nolan for using the name of the Turkish city without permission for the film \"The Dark Knight.\" The city's mayor, Hüseyin Kalkan, wanted compensation from the movie's royalties, claiming the movie's success had negative psychological effects on the city's residents and hurt local businesses trying to register in other countries. The lawsuit, however, was never actually filed.\n\nSleeping student sues teacher for waking him up\n\n• Year: 2008\n\n• Result: Case dismissed\n\nThe parents of Danbury High School student Vinicios Robacher said their son suffered hearing loss after one of his teachers slammed her hand on his desk to wake him up during a math class. The family sued the school, the school board, and the city. But apparently the case fell on deaf ears and collapsed.\n\nWoman sues for false weather prediction\n\n• Year: 1996\n\n• Result: Settled out of court\n\nA woman from the Israeli city of Haifa sued well-known television weatherman Danny Rup for a false weather forecast. Rup had predicted sunny weather and it rained. Based on the forecast, she left her house unprepared for inclement weather, took ill, and missed work – she claimed. The woman said Rup's forecasts were legally binding. She won $1,000 in an out-of-court settlement and got an apology from the weatherman.\n\nStudent sues for A+\n\n• Year: 2003\n\n• Result: Plaintiff lost\n\nBrian Delekta was a senior at Memphis High School in Michigan and believed his work experience as a paralegal at his mother's law office for one of his classes merited an A+ instead of an A. His family sued to raise the grade to A+, which would have made him valedictorian of his class. The suit also asked that publication of class rankings be blocked until the case was settled. The plaintiff lost.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Since 1926, Kanakuk has hosted more than 500,000 campers and 50,000 staffers in Missouri and its many international locations.\n\nThirteen years ago, one of those staff members, Pete Newman, was revealed to be a prolific child molester.\n\nKnown as a charismatic director and ambassador for the camp prior to his 2009 arrest, Newman was charged with crimes involving six underage victims and admitted during sentencing to having “inappropriate activity with as many as 13 more campers,” according to News-Leader coverage of the proceedings. The prosecutor who oversaw the case later estimated the actual number of victims could be in the “hundreds.”\n\nMore:Former Kanakuk counselor Peter Newman named in new sex-abuse lawsuit\n\nNewman's abuse of campers and others he met through Kanakuk-affiliated ministries often began with casual nudity and discussions about how to control sexual desires, progressing to mutual masturbation and sodomy.\n\nIn their statements about Newman, camp leaders say they were deceived.\n\n“More than 12 years ago, one of our staff members was accused and convicted for abusing campers,” reads Kanakuk’s official statement. “(Newman’s) deception of family, friends, Kanakuk, and our camp families was deep.”\n\nKanakuk Ministries president Doug Goodwin, who also has been identified as the camp’s chief operating officer, said in an interview that Newman’s case “was the first time we've ever dealt with anything like this.”\n\nIn a deposition in a civil suit filed by one of Newman’s victims, Kanakuk CEO Joe White said sexual abuse “wasn't even on the radar screen. ... It wasn’t a part of our culture.”\n\nAn increasing amount of evidence contradicts that narrative. Documents Kanakuk released during civil court proceedings show camp leaders were made aware of Newman’s nudity with children and other inappropriate behavior on multiple occasions from 1999 until his confession in 2009. Former Kanakuk staff interviewed for this story, including a supervisor who recommended Newman be fired in 2003, say those red flags were repeatedly excused and dismissed.\n\nNor was Newman alone. In the years before and after his arrest, six other men affiliated with Kanakuk have been convicted of sexual crimes involving children:\n\n• Corbie Dale Grimes, a counselor who held a variety of Kanakuk jobs in the late 1970s and 1980s, was sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for sexually abusing a boy in Texas in 1999. A Kanakuk director testified at Grimes’ trial, where he disclosed that Grimes had been fired from Kanakuk after an incident involving a young male camper.\n\n• Robert John Morgan, who had worked for Kanakuk owner White as a pilot, pleaded guilty in 2004 to sodomizing a young female relative. White testified on Morgan’s behalf and provided him housing at Kanakuk in the off-season while he awaited trial.\n\n• William French Anderson, a lauded scientist known as “the father of gene therapy,” attended Kanakuk as a child and volunteered there for decades, teaching self-defense to campers. He was convicted in California in 2006 of sexually abusing a young girl.\n\n• Paul Kerr, a Kanakuk summer staffer from 1997 to 2005, pleaded guilty in 2012 to sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl at a daycare where he worked in Colorado. He confessed to spying on other young girls for sexual gratification.\n\n• Ed Ringheim, a Kanakuk counselor in the 1990s who later volunteered with the Kanakuk-affiliated KLIFE program in Florida, was convicted in 2012 of seven sex-related felonies involving underage boys, including one victim he had chaperoned from Florida to the Branson camp.\n\n• Lee Bradberry, a Kanakuk counselor, pleaded guilty in 2013 to four sex-related charges involving campers at Kanakuk before he was fired in 2011.\n\nIn interviews for this story, former Kanakuk campers and staff members described incidents involving other men who engaged in red flag behavior as well as alleged sexual abuse.\n\nAn anonymous advocacy website, factsaboutkanakuk.com, has collected other reports.\n\n“Since No More Victims, LLC launched the Facts About Kanakuk website in April 2021, it has received reports of over 60 incidents of Kanakuk abuse spanning from the 1950s to 2022,” the group said in a statement released through its attorney. “When combined with the known information regarding Pete Newman’s abuse victims, that brings the total to over 100 reported victims with allegations of child sexual abuse against 30 perpetrators.”\n\nThe site, which says it is run by victims and their family members but has not revealed its organizers, has called on Kanakuk to be more accountable and transparent.\n\nIn February, the group issued an open letter demanding that Kanakuk agree to an independent investigation of abuse claims. They’ve also called on Kanakuk leaders — several of the people in charge during Newman’s tenure run the camp to this day — to \"admit to known failures” and to release victims from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nKanakuk’s response, an open letter from owner Joe White, was panned by several victims, who said it fell short of taking responsibility and muddied the water with respect to the NDAs. (In the letter, White told victims he and Kanakuk \"will not object to you sharing your story with those who can support your healing.” But, he added, because “most agreements involve insurance companies who may choose to defend their interests, you should keep the terms of your settlement confidential.”)\n\nVictims say such confidentiality clauses have kept stories of abuse at Kanakuk from reaching a national audience — although that is changing.\n\nIn the past two years, media coverage of abuse at Kanakuk has included reporting by Christian financial watchdog organization Ministry Watch, CBS News in Dallas, VICE News and conservative online magazine The Dispatch.\n\nIn March, less than a month after White’s open letter to victims, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation included Kanakuk in its 2022 Dirty Dozen list, alleging “decades of child sexual abuse at Kanakuk Kamps have been swept under the rug by the organization.” The anti-pornography and anti-sex-trafficking charity, which said it had been contacted by three survivors of sexual abuse allegedly linked to the camp, encouraged others to join in its call for increased “responsibility, accountability, and transparency.”\n\nMore:Kanakuk's statement provided in response to the News-Leader's questions\n\nCamp supported, “ministered to” men accused of abuse\n\nWhen Ringheim was arrested in Florida in 2011 for allegedly abusing several boys — including one he had chaperoned to Kanakuk — the camp issued a statement noting it had “extensive policies in place to protect the health and safety of every child attending Kanakuk.”\n\nThe statement also sought to distance the camp (where Ringheim had once worked as a counselor), from KLIFE, the youth ministry for which Ringheim volunteered. Although organized as a separate nonprofit, KLIFE continues to refer to Kanakuk Kamps and other affiliated organizations as “sister ministries” and it is included in a list of programs on the Kanakuk website.\n\nAsked in a March 2021 interview whether he was aware of any improper conduct while Ringheim worked at Kanakuk, president and COO Goodwin — an employee of the camp and related ministries for 36 years — said “No. None at all.”\n\nRobert Shaffer, a Kanakuk counselor from 1991 to 1995, contradicted that claim.\n\nShaffer did not remember the specific year, but said at one point during his tenure he and other counselors learned that Ringheim, also a counselor, had “engaged in sexual misconduct at Kamp. A mother had made an accusation Ed had been sexually inappropriate with her son.”\n\nShaffer recalled that his supervisor at the time, Kris Cooper, told the counselors “Ed crawled into bed with the boy because he was homesick and was attempting to comfort him.”\n\nCooper encouraged the counselors “to continue to support and love Ed and to pray for him,” Shaffer said. “The general tone of the meeting was that it was an awful situation for Ed because he was just trying to be loving to the boy.”\n\nShaffer said the camp reassigned Ringheim to “maintenance” after the complaint.\n\nMore than a decade later, Ringheim volunteered with KLIFE in Orlando. Unaware of the previous allegations against him, parents sometimes hired Ringheim to escort their children to Kanakuk. One of those boys was among the victims when Ringheim was convicted of various sex crimes in 2012.\n\nOther instances revealed Kanakuk’s tendency to support or minister to those accused of abuse rather than report them.\n\nIn 2000, when White’s pilot, Morgan, confessed to sodomizing an adolescent female relative, White gave him off-season housing at Kanakuk while he awaited trial.\n\nWhite also testified as a character witness on Morgan’s behalf and asked the judge not to imprison him. White testified he had confidence “rehabilitation on this side of prison walls is much more healthy for him than rehabilitation behind prison walls” and said he would “trust [Morgan] around my daughters.” Despite those words, the judge sentenced Morgan to 10 years.\n\nFormer Kanakuk counselor Michael Horn of Dallas, Texas said he was working at the camp in 2002 when he and his co-counselor witnessed a third counselor sleeping in a closed sleeping bag with a shirtless child straddling the counselor’s bare chest. (Horn’s co-counselor confirmed the account but did not want to be identified in this story).\n\nHorn said he informed Chancey, the camp director, about what he saw; Chancey told him he reported the incident to White, but said they wanted to allow the counselor to stay at Kanakuk.\n\n“The explanation that I was given was that Kanakuk’s ministry to the counselors is just as important as their ministry to the campers,” said Horn. “[The counselor] clearly had some issues to work through, so it was important that he remain on staff to be ministered to. No mention of children’s safety.”\n\nThe counselor was allowed to stay and to return the following summer, Horn said. “[He] was separated from the kids for one day. Camp went on as normal …\n\n“Worst of all, the child’s parents were not informed.”\n\nMore:From the editor: How we reported stories about sex abuse at Kanakuk Kamps\n\nEven after arrest, leaders talked of \"good work that Pete Newman did for Kamp.”\n\nThe year before Horn reported the incident with the unnamed counselor, Newman received written warning about sleeping with campers.\n\n“I highly recommend not sleeping alone with a kid,” supervisor Will Cunningham wrote to Newman in a 2001 letter Kanakuk shared in several victim lawsuits. “At minimum, this does not look good. At maximum, it could destroy your ministry.”\n\nIn October 2003, after being confronted about being nude with campers, Newman signed a probationary contract. The objective, listed at the top of the document: “To help Pete understand what healthy ministry is, and to make sure Pete never places himself in a compromising position that his integrity would be in question. We want to insure [sic] that Pete be involved in a lifetime of ministry.”\n\nOn March 16, 2009, after Newman confessed to abusing male campers, White sent an email telling Kanakuk families that Newman left the camp while \"dealing with a personal family crisis.\n\n“He has asked that you respect his privacy and not contact him or his family, but that you keep him in your prayers.”\n\n(When Newman was arrested six months later, the camp issued an alert to camp families that included the sexual abuse allegations.)\n\nOn April 23, after a Taney County Sheriff's detective interviewed Kanakuk director Kris Cooper about Newman’s sexual crimes, he noted in the incident report, “Kris mainly talked about the accomplishments and good work that Pete Newman did for Kamp.”\n\nEven after Newman’s 2010 conviction, Kanakuk leaders esteem for Newman remained evident.\n\n“I was at camp the day Pete was convicted,” said a former Texas camper who was 15 years old at the time. “Joe White came into the dining hall at lunch and made an announcement. He talked a lot about how a great Christian man in leadership at Kanakuk made a mistake and was going to prison for it.”\n\n“Joe went on and on about how he was a good man who the Lord would continue to use,” said the camper, who asked not to be named publicly. “It wasn't until years later that I learned that ‘good’ man was a pedophile and the people needing the prayers were the countless victims I spent my summers with, not Pete.”\n\nNewman himself commented on the “love” and “support” and “belief” White had shown him in a handwritten letter after his confession.\n\nThough the last decade of Newman’s employment was marked by repeated reports of nudity with campers and other rule violations, he wrote to White: “You told me the 1st day I arrived in Branson that you would be my ‘Missouri Daddy.’ ...\n\n“You have shown me nothing but grace through the years.”\n\nMore:Kanakuk camper says she was told to apologize, denied call home after reporting abuse\n\nBefore Pete Newman, counselors fired for ‘inappropriate behavior’\n\nNot all reports of inappropriate behavior went unpunished. On at least two occasions prior to Newman’s confession, male counselors at Kanakuk were fired over alleged sexual touching.\n\nCorbie Dale Grimes, who worked at Kanakuk in the 1970s and ’80s, is serving a life sentence for abusing a boy in Texas in 1999.\n\nIn a recorded 2021 phone interview, Kanakuk COO Goodwin was asked if the camp knew of “any reports, any misconduct” involving Grimes during his employment. Goodwin indicated there was nothing unusual about Grimes’ departure.\n\n“Why did he leave? He was only a summer staff. They left all the time …,” Goodwin said. “Usually people, after two or three years in college, they have other jobs.”\n\nIn fact, Grimes — who worked summers at Kanakuk for more than a decade and had roles on the leadership team — did not leave voluntarily.\n\n“Mr. Grimes was terminated by Kanakuk for inappropriate behavior and poor judgment,” according to an April 3, 2021 letter attorney Ted Tredennick sent to the FactsAboutKanakuk website and No More Victims LLC demanding that the site retract statements his client, Kanakuk, said were inaccurate.\n\nIn the letter, Tredennick said Grimes’ actions “did not constitute a ‘reportable offense’ in a criminal context” when Grimes was terminated in 1989.\n\nHowever, those actions were serious enough that former Kanakuk administrator Cooper — who in 2002 was co-director of the K-1 camp with Goodwin — was compelled to testify at Grimes’ trial.\n\n“The last summer [Grimes] was with us, he had been given an elevated job, a middle management job, if you will, where he takes 20 kids at a time out of the camp facility where they spend three days and two nights camping away from the big camp facility,” Cooper said, according to a transcript of his 2002 testimony.\n\nCooper testified Grimes was fired after encouraging a camper to “pull his pants down, and Mr. Grimes … [was] whacking his pee pee with a stick,” which Cooper said involved Grimes touching the child’s penis with a “tent stake” in a non-aggressive manner.\n\nCooper characterized this as “inappropriate behavior on Corbie’s part,” which the camp deemed “inappropriate enough that we let him go.”\n\nAnother Kanakuk employee fired after confession, former leaders say\n\nAnother Kanakuk employee, Chuck Price, was fired in 1990, according to a victim, her mother and two former Kanakuk staff members who investigated separate complaints against him.\n\nJody Jones was an 8-year-old camper at Kanakuk in 1985.\n\n“It was a night when we were going to have a swim and then watch a movie,” said Jones, who agreed to be identified by name for this story. “I had a towel around my shoulders and just the bathing suit on.”\n\nJones said she was laying down to watch the movie when Price sat next to her and began tickling her foot. She didn’t think much of it at first.\n\n“Then he made his way up my leg and put his fingers in my vagina,” she said. “I laid there … then I sat up and said, ‘Chuck!’ He froze.”\n\nJones said Price left and she continued to watch the movie. Years passed before she managed to tell anyone.\n\nIn the intervening time, another camper reported that Price rubbed her leg and stuck his hand up her miniskirt on a Kanakuk-affiliated bus trip in either 1985 or 1986. That camper, who did not want to be identified, said she reported the incident to Kanakuk leadership. The staff member who received the report confirmed that it was made and expressed regret at not investigating more diligently.\n\n“Pedophilia wasn’t on my radar. It should’ve been, but it wasn’t,” said the former Kanakuk employee, who was interviewed for this story on the condition of not being named. “I didn’t alert the police, which was a mistake. I didn’t know what to do … (but) even if the organization didn’t offer training it was my responsibility as someone who worked with youth in any capacity to be prepared.”\n\nIn 1990, Jones returned to Kanakuk and saw Price again.\n\n“The camps were getting together for an activity,” said Jones, who was then 13. “When we got there, Chuck was up on stage and the entire crowd of kids was cheering, ‘Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!’ I lost it. With all those people cheering, I got up the courage. It made me cry to think about telling my parents.\n\n“Today it still makes me cry.”\n\nJones said she told a friend (who confirmed her account when contacted for this story) about the 1985 incident, as well as her counselor and a camp director.\n\n“I was in a room with the director, and about three other people. Nobody really reacted,” Jones said. “There was no ‘I'm so sorry this happened to you. I don't remember any kind of sympathy or, or real care or — God — 'maybe we should get a therapist in here.' It was like nothing happened.”\n\nA former Kanakuk leadership team member who was involved in the investigation said he witnessed Price admit to touching Jones.\n\n“We were shocked, because Chuck never had any other incidents at all,” said the former leadership team member, who insisted on anonymity before speaking with a reporter. “Everyone loved Chuck. But when I confronted him, my recollection is that he admitted to running his finger across her waist and breast.”\n\n“He said he didn't go under her clothing or penetrate her. Still, it was enough for him to be fired, and he was fired immediately the same day. Our policies had no tolerance for any inappropriate physical contact with anyone — staff members or campers. So, he was gone.”\n\nJody’s mother, Christine Jones, said a Kanakuk director “assured me Price had never abused before, and it would not happen again. It had been handled.”\n\nThe former Kanakuk staff members who separately investigated the two incidents each said they were unaware of the other complaint against Price.\n\nLike the first incident, the second allegation was not reported to police. Christine Jones said camp leaders persuaded her that subjecting her daughter to questioning could be traumatic; the former leadership team member recalled that the Jones family asked not to contact authorities and the camp honored that request.\n\n“We figured, if at any time thereafter they changed their minds we could immediately contact the police,” he said. “If we got any reference calls about any future employment … any job with kids ... we could nip that in the bud and prevent Chuck from ever getting a job with children.”\n\nThat was not the case. Price, who has worked with at least three schools and is a girls volleyball coach in St. Louis, continued to volunteer with the Kanakuk-affiliated KLIFE youth ministry until at least February 2022, when a reporter called the Urban KLIFE chapter in St. Louis. In a picture from 2017 posted on his Facebook page and later made private, Price posed with Kanakuk CEO White while wearing a Kanakuk visitor’s pass around his neck.\n\nContacted by a reporter on Aug. 26, 2021 and asked if he was fired from Kanakuk for abusing a child, Price did not answer the question. Instead he responded: “I am busy doing the work of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, and that is all I’m focusing on.”\n\nMore:‘It was just a thing at Kanakuk’: Campers and staff say nudity was part of camp culture\n\nKanakuk counselor who abused boy in Texas reported to police\n\nKanakuk did not report the allegations against Grimes or Price to police. In court documents, interviews and other information reviewed by the News-Leader, the first reference to Kanakuk contacting authorities about potential abuse is in the early 2000s, when the camp reached out to a former Taney County prosecutor to ask whether Newman might have broken the law by being nude with children.\n\n(Former prosecutor Merrell, who filed charges against Newman after his 2009 confession, confirmed that a predecessor had reviewed the matter and concluded Newman exercised “poor judgment” but had not violated the law.)\n\nAt least one Kanakuk counselor — Paul Green — was investigated prior to that time after allegedly abusing a Texas boy.\n\n“People thought of Paul Green as this God-like figure,” said Blake Fusch, who was 14 when he spent a summer in the 30-year-old counselor’s cabin.\n\nWhen Green entered the room, kids chanted his name, Fusch said. “Everybody looked up to him.”\n\nFusch’s parents met Green when they picked their son up from camp and were impressed. When they vacationed in Florida, where Green was living, they invited him along, a common practice among Kanakuk families who got to know the trusted counselors outside of camp. In November 1994, Green spent Thanksgiving with them in Dallas.\n\nIt was during that Thanksgiving visit that Fusch said he woke one night and could tell that Green, who had been sleeping on an adjacent trundle bed, had been reaching into Fusch’s underwear as he slept. Fusch said he stayed awake and when Green hand crept onto the bed again, “I kept rolling around all night and avoiding him.”\n\nThe next day, Fusch asked to have a friend spend the night so they could sleep in the living room, away from Green.\n\n“I was trying to avoid him,” Fusch said. “He knew I knew. I knew he knew.”\n\nFusch said Green packed and left abruptly after hearing Fusch tell his sister about the abuse. A day later, Fusch told his parents, who alerted police and met with a Dallas detective who specialized in investigating sex crimes. The detective suggested having the boy confront Green on a phone call, which police would record.\n\n“It was the type of thing that happens in movies,” said Susan Fusch, Blake’s mother.\n\nBlake Fusch said he struggled to bring up the abuse with Green on the phone, but eventually summoned the courage.\n\n“I know what you were doing to me at night, and I didn't like it,” he said. After a few moments of silence, Fusch said, Green replied: “It was an isolated situation and it’ll never happen again.”\n\nIt was enough. At a meeting with the detective the next Monday morning, the family was told to expect an arrest that week. But Green would never face charges.\n\nBefore sunrise that same morning, Green — a graduate student at Louisiana State University – crashed his car into a highway overpass support and died, according to a Dec. 6, 1994 report in the Baton Rouge Advocate.\n\nFusch’s parents said they spoke to some of Green’s fraternity brothers, several of whom had been up studying the night before the crash, who told them Green had been pacing back and forth in the fraternity house and later declared he was going to work early.\n\n“I think he committed suicide,” Fusch said. “The death was harder for me to deal with than the abuse, because I felt like I had driven him to it.”\n\nFusch and his parents said they informed a Kanakuk “trip director” of the abuse and were told that the information would be relayed to White, the CEO. It’s not known if the allegations against Green were shared with other parents — Goodwin, the Kanakuk Ministries president, said the camp did not have a policy at that time of alerting parents when former counselors were revealed to be abusers.\n\nInstead, Fusch said he shared the information with fellow campers himself after asking permission from camp staff.\n\n“I was conflicted, because everyone was grieving this icon of Kanakuk,” Fusch said. “It was something I felt needed to be done, but it was awkward because I didn’t want to go into detail. Maybe I owed them the details … It was probably shocking for 15-year-olds to hear.”\n\nVictims call for accountability, freedom to speak\n\nFusch said his opinion of Kanakuk is not all negative. He hopes the camp’s leaders will read victims’ accounts and other coverage “and maybe see that there’s more to it than they’ve been willing to take responsibility for.”\n\n“I’m not trying to burn the camp down …,” he said. “I just want people to feel safe to talk about it.”\n\nDespite the information provided by victims and former employees about incidents involving Ringheim, Price, Green and others, Kanakuk’s longtime leaders publicly acknowledge only two abusers: Newman, arrested in 2009, and Bradberry, whose 2011 arrest the camp credits to its Child Protection Plan.\n\n“In 2009 and 2011, Kanakuk discovered that two employees had violated the sacred trust that we and our camp families placed in them through abusive actions that stand counter to our mission and values,” wrote Goodwin, the Kanakuk Ministries president, in a May 4 message to incoming campers. “… While we are not aware of any other reports of abuse at Kanakuk, we will continue to apply and evaluate our safety practices to help keep Kamp safe and fun for all.”\n\nIn addition to reviewing safety protocols implemented in the wake of Newman’s prosecution, Goodwin’s May 4 message included a section warning families of a “campaign of misinformation and defamation” against Kanakuk. The letter refers to “several authors and a website run by an anonymously owned LLC,” as well as “a vocal group that includes some victims and former employees” who have “fallen prey to many of these false narratives and [have] added their voices in support.”\n\n\"We will not be surprised — and are fully prepared — if future publicity stunts by these groups should include lawsuits, online productions, or other efforts to gain media attention or disrupt our ministry operations,” Goodwin wrote. “Pursuing such actions would be unfortunate, but Kanakuk has been transparent and has nothing to hide.”\n\nKanakuk’s critics argue that, rather than being transparent, the camp has downplayed institutional failures and sought to limit media exposure while muzzling victims with the use of non-disclosure agreements.\n\nCunningham, the former K-Kountry director who was Newman’s supervisor (and in 2003 recommended Newman be fired), said he believes the camp has not come clean about past abuse.\n\n\"Joe (White)'s continued lack of transparency — by not publicly admitting he knew of Newman's nudity when he did — prolongs the pain and anger of Pete's victims,\" Cunningham said.\n\nParents whose sons were abused by Newman are among those demanding public accountability from White and others at the camp.\n\n“The night I learned that my son had been abused for over three years at your camp, in multiple states, overseas, and in my own home by Pete Newman, I called you,” wrote one distraught father, Greg Yandell, in a March 2022 letter to Kanakuk CEO White. “I point blank asked you … if you knew of any previous signs or situations that indicated that Newman had abused young boys, or had acted in an inappropriate way around young boys. Your immediate and direct answer to me was ‘I had no idea. I had never seen anything that caused me concern. I am just as shocked as anyone.’ …\n\n“I have since learned you lied to me, Joe.”\n\nToby Neugebauer, a Texas businessman who sent his own kids to Kanakuk as well as sponsoring other children to attend Kanakuk-related retreats, contacted Kanakuk leadership after Newman’s confession.\n\n“I immediately reached out to Joe White. My perception was that Joe was ‘camp first, victims second,’” said Neugebauer.\n\nAccording to Neugebauer, White refused his call for an independent investigation and seemed more focused on protecting Kanakuk’s reputation, framing the crisis as a spiritual battle between good — the camp — and evil.\n\n“‘Toby, get on board,’” Neugebauer said White told him. “‘The devil’s trying to get us.’”\n\nSome victims, families say NDA's add to trauma of abuse\n\nThose seeking to spotlight abuse at Kanakuk also have demanded that victims and their families be freed from the NDAs many signed when they settled lawsuits against the camp.\n\nOne NDA reviewed for this story stipulated that the victim who signed it could not divulge the details of the “confidentiality release” to “the news media, print media, broadcast media,” or to people associated with newspapers, magazines, periodicals, radio stations, or books. It also prohibited sharing the information with any federal or state governmental agencies.\n\n“Kanakuk didn’t even want my son to be able to give his testimony at church,” said Joe Alarcon, a Texas father whose son Ashton was abused by Newman. The Alarcons refused the camp’s confidentiality agreement terms, after which Kanakuk’s attorneys threatened them with legal action and asked a judge to sanction them with fines.\n\nLogan Yandell, one of Newman’s victims who signed an NDA as part of a settlement, initially agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. Prior to publication, he and his parents decided to be quoted by name.\n\nYandell said the legal restrictions included in the settlement compounded the trauma of the abuse.\n\n“I’m technically not allowed to tell a therapist, when that’s what the settlement money was supposed to be used for. It certainly has hindered the healing process,” he said. “I struggled a lot longer with substance abuse disorders ... Many days I really wished I never woke up and would ‘self-medicate,’ but I never did overdose, somehow.”\n\n“When I was younger and when things were harder, I had a contingency plan for how I planned [to die],” he said.\n\nOther parents say they still fear for the lives of their children.\n\n“Suicide is not out of the question when it comes to my son,” said one mother who believed her son’s claims of abuse after reading about Newman in recent coverage. “I just kind of wait for it.”\n\nNo More Victims, LLC, the group behind the Facts About Kanakuk website, said in a statement it has “received reports of eight Kanakuk victims whose deaths are suspected to be related to their abuse.”\n\nOne Newman victim, Trey Carlock, died by suicide in 2019 shortly after settling his case with Kanakuk.\n\nHis sister, Elizabeth Phillips, said her brother considered the settlement “blood money” and felt so constrained by his NDA he worried he couldn’t even talk about his abuse in therapeutic settings.\n\n“A few days before my brother died, he told a therapist, ‘They are always going to control me and I’ll never be free,’” she said.\n\n“He was silenced to his grave ...

On his birthday, Sandmann announced on Twitter that the Washington Post settled its lawsuit as well.\n\nIn March, the teen sued five more outlets, including Gannett, which is the parent company of The Enquirer.\n\nThe national interest in the teen began in January 2019 when news outlets reported on a viral video of Sandmann at an incident at the Lincoln Memorial.

In February, the family started the process to claim the money in Kenton County probate court, according to court documents.\n\nThat process was delayed because the COVID-19 pandemic closed in-person hearings. The family had a virtual hearing scheduled.\n\nThen, Sandmann's parents and CNN decided to wait for Sandmann's 18th birthday in July to finish the settlement and keep it confidential, according to court documents.\n\nIn May, the family and CNN stopped that process because Sandmann's birthday was just three months away, which meant the settlement could be confidential.\n\n\"As a result of the delays caused by COVID-19, with Nicholas’ eighteenth birthday just three months away in July 2020, and in light of the parties’ joint desire to ensure the confidentiality of the settlement, the parties to the Lawsuit will wait until Nicholas’ eighteenth birthday to consummate the settlement,\" Sandmann's attorney, Todd McMurtry, wrote in court documents.\n\nJulia is the Northern Kentucky government reporter through the Report For America program.

Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form.\n\n\"This adds to the evidence that a changing climate makes it harder to reduce ozone pollution and protect human health,\" Alexander said\n\nBakersfield took the top spot in a list of cities with another variety of air pollution — small particulate matter, aka soot. Increased heat, changes in climate patterns, drought and wildfires — many related to climate change — contributed to the high number of days with unhealthy particulate matter.\n\nSince California is known for its strict environmental regulations, why are so many cities from the state typically on this list? It's because the state would be far worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal-fired power plants. California has done more than any other state to counteract air pollution, the Lung Association said.\n\nWith this report, the Lung Association also calls out Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for ongoing threats to the nation’s air quality, including steps to roll back or weaken enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\n\nEPA administrator Scott Pruitt has taken many steps to roll back or put in loopholes to the Clean Air Act, Alexander said, adding that \"the association is concerned and we will continue to fight for healthy air,\" she said.\n\nSome good news in the report was that particulate pollution \"generally continued to improve in 2014-16,\" the report said. This was true for both short-term particulate pollution and for year-round particulate pollution.\n\nFor year-round particle pollution, Fairbanks, Alaska, was the most-polluted city.\n\nThe Lung Association also lists the nation's cleanest cities, meaning ones that experience no high ozone or high particulate pollution days.\n\nThe nation's cleanest cities are Bellingham, Wash.; Burlington, Vt.; Casper, Wyo.; Honolulu; Melbourne, Fla.; and Wilmington, N.C.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2018/04/18/new-jerseys-air-among-worst-nation/521041002/", "title": "Air pollution in New Jersey is so bad it could be dangerous to your ...", "text": "New Jersey’s air continues to be among the most polluted in the nation, with a large swath of the state receiving failing grades for smog, according to a report by the American Lung Association released Wednesday.\n\nNorth Jersey and New York City ranked as the 10th worst metropolitan area in the U.S. for ozone levels, the main ingredient in smog that can trigger asthma attacks in the estimated 735,000 state residents who suffer from the disease.\n\nMuch of the Jersey Shore and the South Jersey counties outside Philadelphia also received failing grades over a three-year period from 2014-2016, the latest data show.\n\nLike the rest of the nation, New Jersey's smog levels were worse in 2016 because of record-setting high temperatures.

Or east, because there’s another in the region. In fact, nearly every direction you go will take you to a coal plant — seven within 30 miles.\n\nCollectively they pump out millions of pounds of toxic air pollution. They throw off greenhouse gases on par with Hong Kong or Sweden.\n\nIndustrial air pollution — bad for people’s health, bad for the planet — is strikingly concentrated in America among a small number of facilities like those in southwest Indiana, according to a nine-month Center for Public Integrity investigation.\n\nThe Center, which merged two federal datasets to create an unprecedented picture of air emissions, found that a third of the toxic air releases in 2014 from power plants, factories and other facilities came from just 100 complexes out of more than 20,000 reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A third of the greenhouse-gas emissions reported by industrial sites came from just 100, too. Some academics have a name for them: super polluters.\n\nTwenty-two sites appeared on both lists. They include ExxonMobil’s massive refinery and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas, and a slew of coal-fired power plants, from FirstEnergy’s Harrison in West Virginia to Conemaugh in Pennsylvania, owned by companies including NRG Energy and PSEG. Four are in a single region — southwest Indiana. Together, owners of these 22 sites reported profits in excess of $58 billion in 2014.\n\nSRP's northern Arizona coal plant one of the biggest carbon emitters in the country\n\nThomas O. McGarity, a law professor and regulatory scholar at the University of Texas at Austin, said the Center’s findings show that “a lot of the problem is isolated, and what we need to do is focus in on these plants.”\n\nThe EPA says it’s doing that. In a written statement, the agency said its sustained emphasis on the electric power sector has led to “dramatically” lower emissions from power plants since 1990 — “while the U.S. economy has continued to grow” — and it is working to get further improvements.\n\nBut not all the states are on board. Indiana is one of 27 suing the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which would require reductions in climate-altering greenhouse-gas pollution from electric utilities. Indiana is also among the states that tried to block a federal rule to reduce emissions of dangerous metals and acid gases from coal- and oil-fired power plants. Its governor, Mike Pence — Donald Trump’s running mate — is a pro-coal, climate-change skeptic who says the costs of shifting to cleaner energy sources are too high.\n\nMaintaining the status quo has costs as well: bad air that threatens health and fuels global warming. More toxic pollution from utility coal plants was sent into the air within 30 miles of Evansville than around any other mid-sized or large American city in 2014, a Center analysis shows. That same 30-mile radius accounted for the most greenhouse gases released by U.S. coal plants that year around any city.\n\nAcross the country, the top 100 facilities releasing greenhouse gases — almost all of them coal plants — collectively added more than a billion metric tons to the atmosphere in 2014. That’s the equivalent of a year’s worth of such emissions from 219 million passenger vehicles — nearly twice as many as the total number registered nationwide.\n\nGlatfelter among nation's worst air polluters\n\nThe top 100 for toxic air emissions vented more than 270 million pounds of chemicals in 2014. The vast majority of these chemicals have known health risks, according to the EPA; they can target the lungs, the brain or other organs, and some can affect the development of children born and unborn.\n\nEight of the super polluters have closed. The rest, including all four in Indiana, still operate.\n\nTina Dearing, 48, from Huntingburg, Indiana, was unexpectedly widowed in March when her 57-year-old husband died of a heart attack. Coronary artery disease, the death certificate says. Two months later, researchers published the results of a 10-year study that showed why previous investigations kept finding shorter lifespans in areas with poorer air quality: pollution appears to accelerate harmful deposits in the arteries that cause nearly all heart attacks and most strokes.\n\nDearing’s family lives northeast of Evansville in a community within 30 miles of two of Indiana’s largest coal plants. She knows a variety of factors can play a role in an early death, but believes dirty air contributed in her husband’s case.\n\n“The air quality stinks,” she said.\n\nThe Center, which relied on the EPA’s most recent final Toxics Release Inventory data to track total chemical releases, found that the people who live within three miles of the top 100 polluters are in some ways a cross-section of America: spread across half the states, all races, young and old, in a wide range of income brackets.\n\nBut more of them are poor or African-American than the country as a whole, data from the U.S. Census Bureau show. For instance, nearly 90 percent of the thousands living within three miles of ExxonMobil’s refinery and chemical plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, are black and about a third are below the poverty line. The complex, which ExxonMobil said has reduced total emissions over 40 percent since 1990, released more than 2.6 million pounds of chemicals to the air in 2014, including hydrogen cyanide — which can cause headaches, confusion and nausea — and known carcinogens such as benzene.\n\nIowa ranks in top 20 for toxic air releases\n\nMary B. Collins with the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and two other researchers found similar disparities in a sophisticated analysis this year, writing that “there exists a class of hyper-polluters — the worst-of-the-worst — that disproportionately expose communities of color and low income populations to chemical releases.”\n\nWhile people nearby are the most affected, these facilities can degrade air far afield. Almost all the states with top toxic-air emitters send a significant amount of pollution to downwind states, according to EPA analyses — in some cases reaching people hundreds of miles away.\n\nSome of the companies that own the nation’s biggest polluters say their emissions break no rules and are simply a reflection of a facility’s size. Others point out that they’ve ratcheted down releases in recent years, including after 2014. FirstEnergy said it has shuttered coal plants accounting for more than 5,000 megawatts of power generation since 2012.\n\nNRG, which owns or co-owns several coal plants on the top-100 lists, said its toxic air emissions are falling, including a sharp drop in mercury in 2015 to comply with new federal regulations, and it has set aggressive climate goals — a 50-percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2030, 90 percent by 2050 — that would mean a major overhaul in the way it makes power.\n\n“Things can’t continue on the same path as they have for decades,” Bruno Sarda, NRG’s chief sustainability officer, said of businesses worldwide. “More and more of our new revenue is coming from much lower-carbon sources.”\n\nBut coal is far from dead in America. And the tug-of-war over the future of electric power generation will affect everyone, some more than others. The influential utility industry. Blue-collar energy workers, from coal miners to solar-panel installers. Neighbors of coal plants. Electricity customers. People suffering from the lengthening pollen season, dangerous heat waves, devastating floods and other effects of global warming.\n\nTo watch this unfold, come to one of the biggest coal-burning states, a place with no renewable-energy requirements. No mandatory energy-efficiency targets to cut back on unnecessary, money-wasting usage. No contingency plan for climate-change repercussions, which so worried local university researchers that a group of them sent a letter to the governor last fall pleading with him to call on their expertise — a letter that went unanswered.\n\nCome to Indiana.\n\nLiving and dying in Evansville\n\nKavon Cooper’s asthma, his mother says, “was a constant battle.” If he spent too much time outside in Evansville, he needed medicine to breathe. If he went to a friend’s house, he never knew if he’d have to go home in a hurry. Sometimes his asthma attacks were so bad that he ended up in the hospital. So he stayed inside as much as possible with the windows closed, playing video games, dreaming of testing them for a living someday.\n\nFor all that, the 12-year-old seemed to be getting better. It was a shock when he collapsed and died at home last year, lying in the hallway by the bathroom as his nebulizer ran in his bedroom. The coroner ruled that he’d suffered an acute asthma attack.\n\nHis mother, Kris Dasch, 47, couldn’t understand what had happened. The only explanation she got was that pollen had spiked.\n\nSo had air pollution. But no one had told her that.\n\nLevels of toxic specks called fine particles — typically formed by emissions from power plants, vehicles and factories — leapt up 20 micrograms per cubic meter the previous day, according to the air monitor less than a half-mile from the family’s home. They began to ease overnight, then jumped another 9 micrograms shortly before his death. Levels of sulfur dioxide, another common power-plant pollutant, also rapidly increased at the same time that morning.\n\nThese are conditions that researchsuggests can trigger a severe, even deadly, lung reaction. No one had told Dasch that, either. No doctor had ever discussed air quality with her, other than the effects of pollen.\n\nDr. Carrie A. Redlich, director of the Yale Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program, suspects that’s almost always the case. Many physicians don’t think about the connection between air pollution and health, Redlich said. They might not know, for example, that research suggests tainted air and allergens such as pollen work like a one-two punch — together, the reaction is worse.\n\nThat both spiked in the lead-up to Kavon’s death makes them sound to Redlich like contributing factors. “That is an important interaction,” she said.\n\nNow that air quality is on her mind, Dasch makes connections that didn’t stick out before. How well Kavon did on the rare occasions he took a trip outside the region. How a neighbor mentioned that her son’s asthma didn’t bother him as much when they lived in Arizona. How “there’s a lot of illness, a lot of sickness in this area.”\n\nVanderburgh County, which includes Evansville, has lower life expectancy compared with peer counties across the country and a higher rate of adults reporting fair-to-poor health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Community Health Status Indicators. Some key influencers — poverty, unemployment and obesity — are actually better here than in most peer counties. What’s counterbalancing it are higher rates of smoking and air pollution.\n\nResearchers already knew that poor air quality impairs children’s lung development, but studies in the past few years have also suggested multiple in utero complications such as autism spectrum disorder, found a possible connection with childhood psychiatric conditions and linked exposure to damage that can trigger neurological problems in old age. In 2013, the World Health Organization declared that air pollution causes cancer. Inflammation kicked off by the pollutants seems to be the common denominator.\n\n“You add air pollution together with a lot of smokers, you are adding a lot of disease, premature death and costs that the state of Indiana incurs,” said Dr. Stephen Jay, a pulmonologist and emeritus professor of public health at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis who has pressed for a shift to clean energy.\n\nLori Salma, a preschool teacher from Evansville, says she is struck by the number of young children using lung medication. She and her 14-year-old son both have asthma, and there are days “when I feel winded after being outside for longer than 15 minutes.”\n\nShe’s frustrated that for all they’ve done in their house to try to reduce flare-ups — no carpets, no curtains, no pets and, of course, no smoking — “there’s nothing we can do to control the air that we breathe.”\n\nTina Dearing said her late husband, Vincent, would come home to Huntingtburg from business trips and complain that inhaling the local air felt like someone standing on his chest. Her oldest daughter had trouble breathing as an infant. And she wonders whether the air contributed to her daughter’s daughter, now 2, being born so small — not preterm, but just 5 1/2 pounds. (Researchsuggests that air pollution can decrease birth weight.)\n\n“That’s why we limit our time outside,” Dearing said.\n\nRose Hoffman and her family lived in a community near Dearing's for years before moving in 2012 to Champaign, Illinois. Air quality was not the reason — in fact, when she occasionally heard bad news about it, “I didn’t want to believe it because we enjoyed living there so very much.” But what happened after they left, she said, “was stunning.”\n\nHer nighttime wheezing stopped. Her youngest daughter no longer coughs at bedtime. The awful migraines besetting two of her children went away almost entirely and hers eased. Her husband, a doctor, saw his asthma symptoms improve.\n\nHoffman, 45, had assumed genetics, or being the child of smokers, explained her severe lung damage following a bout with pneumonia in Indiana — her doctors had no idea why it happened. Now, she can’t help but think that air could have played a role in that, too.\n\nThe state of the air\n\nSouthwest Indiana doesn’t look like an industry stronghold. Evansville, population 120,000, is the biggest city by far amid the rippling farmland. Rural Kentucky is just across the Ohio River, while the state capital of Indianapolis — and the massive steelmaking complexes in northern Indiana — are hours and a world away.\n\nBut this is coal country, where the state’s 6,500 mining jobs are concentrated. Six coal plants operate here: Gibson, Rockport, Petersburg, Warrick, A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley, all but one within 30 miles of Evansville, which is also near two coal plants in Kentucky. A large piece of southwest Indiana power travels on transmission lines to be used elsewhere because the plants make more than 40 percent of the state’s electricity in an area with just 6 percent of its people.\n\nThey also make a disproportionate share of the pollution. The plants accounted for a quarter of Indiana air emissions reported to the EPA’s toxics inventory in 2014, a remarkable concentration in the most manufacturing-intensive state in the nation. Within the seven most southwestern counties here, three-quarters of the air pollution recorded in the inventory came from the six coal plants. And that doesn’t count the effects of the Kentucky plants.\n\nAsk Mark Maassel about the air and he’ll recount the billions of dollars in environmental controls his members have installed over the last decade, some required by federal rules, some by EPA enforcement actions. He’s president of the Indiana Energy Association, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, and he sees “very significant changes and improvements in the environment of the state.”\n\nPower plants’ sulfur dioxide emissions dropped 64 percent statewide between 2000 and 2014, he said. Nitrogen dioxide, which harms the lungs and contributes to ozone, often called smog, fell 69 percent, he said. As some coal plants shut down, carbon dioxide — which warms the atmosphere — also declined.\n\nThat’s meant cleaner air. Evansville-area concentrations of fine particles dropped nearly 30 percent over the past decade, EPA monitoring figures show.\n\nBut the air here is still worse than in most of the country.\n\nVanderburgh County had higher levels of fine particles than nearly 90 percent of the U.S. counties with air monitors from 2013 to 2015, EPA records of average annual concentrations show. Vanderburgh was nearly on par with Manhattan, even though that New York City borough has nine times as many people and a lot more particle-spewing vehicles.\n\nDespite that — and despite some power plants here runningafoul of EPA rules in recent years, including for sulfur dioxide — the region isn’t violating federal air-quality standards for fine particles.\n\n“The good news is, as of today, the entire monitoring network within the southwest Indiana area does demonstrate compliance,” said Scott Deloney, air programs branch chief at the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.\n\nThe bad news: The standard for particles is based on total amount, but research is finding they aren’t equally unhealthy. The most toxic ones, a 2015 study by 11 researchers in the U.S. and Canada suggested, come from burning coal.\n\nWhat’s more, researchers keep finding harm from fine particles at levels below the standard, which the EPA is reviewing to determine if it’s still appropriate. A new study led by a Johns Hopkins University researcher that focused on Boston — with markedly better particle levels than Evansville — found an association between that air pollutant and intrauterine inflammation, a key risk factor for premature birth.\n\nIn March, a New York University study estimated the share of premature births that can be attributed to fine particles. Indiana was second-highest in the country.\n\nPremature birth can have lifelong consequences for children and is the biggest cause of infant mortality — a challenge for Indiana, tied for ninth-worst on infant death among U.S. states. Some studies have specifically linked air pollution to infant death rates.\n\nDr. Edward McCabe, chief medical officer at the infant-focused March of Dimes, says the evidence of pregnancy harms is now substantial enough that action — not simply further study — is required: “We need to do something about it.”\n\nBut Indiana officials, focused on more widely understood risk factors such as smoking, which the state has high rates of, haven’t delved into pollution as a possible contributor. A 2014 state report aimed at improving infant survival rates didn’t mention air quality at all.\n\nAsked about it, Indiana State Department of Health spokeswoman Jennifer O’Malley said by email that “outdoor air quality is beyond the scope of ISDH and was not a consideration” in its infant-mortality work. She referred questions to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which said it has no public-health specialists on staff.\n\nDr. Norma Kreilein, a pediatrician in southwest Indiana who has tried to draw attention to environmental-health problems she sees in the region, is fed up with the state.\n\n“They’ve refused to connect pollution to public health,” Kreilein said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Pence did not answer questions about the matter or anything else for this story, except for one asking for his perspective on coal.\n\n“This abundant Hoosier resource supports over 26,000 Hoosier jobs and has historically provided Indiana’s economy with competitive electricity prices,” the spokeswoman, Kara Brooks, said by email. “Unfortunately, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan will drive up electricity prices, threaten electricity reliability, and put coal miners out of work. That is bad for Indiana and bad for America.”\n\nPro-coal state\n\nAs Pence himself put it last year, Indiana is a “proud pro-coal state,” and its energy use reflects that. It relies on coal for 75 percent of its electricity, at a time when the national average has fallen to 33 percent.\n\nPence gave up his shot at re-election this fall to run with Trump in the presidential election. The Democrat in the governor’s race? A former coal lobbyist.\n\nPence’s popular Republican predecessor also was pro-coal, and supported a coal-gasification power plant project that went way over budget. But former Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration also started a mandatory energy-efficiency program to cut back on waste and crafted rules to allow more people to go solar.\n\nThe efficiency program is gone now, replaced with a law that sets no reduction targets for utilities and has saved less energy, according to the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. State lawmakers tried last year to allow utilities to raise costs for customers with solar panels, stepping back only after they were flooded with complaints — solar advocates fear another attempt will come. And then there’s Indiana’s challenge with other states to the Clean Power Plan, now under a U.S. Supreme Court stay as a lower court considers the arguments.\n\nThat hasn’t kept change from happening, because national forces pressuring coal — cheap natural gas, falling costs for renewables, federal pollution rules — are here, too. As recently as 2009, more than 90 percent of Indiana’s electricity was coal-fired.\n\nBut if a complete energy transformation is inevitable, as some in Indiana assume, getting there quickly is not. There’s so much farther to go here than in most places.\n\nJust a handful of states get a larger share of their electricity from coal, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration figures, and none is as populous as Indiana. The only place that burns more tons of coal for power is Texas, which makes four times the electricity and gets a lot of it from natural gas.\n\nIndiana made 16 percent of its electricity from natural gas last year. That fuel’s unhealthy air emissions when burned are sharply lower than coal’s. (Natural-gas power plants aren’t tracked by the Toxics Release Inventory, which exempts certain operations from otherwise fairly broad coverage.) Gas plants also release 40 to 50 percent less greenhouse gases than equally sized coal plants, though that doesn’t include potent methane leaks before the fuel arrives on site.\n\nThen there’s wind and solar, which account for about 5 percent of Indiana’s electricity. Because of its lopsided energy profile, Indiana gets bigger health and environmental benefits from new wind turbines than any other state, and among the biggest from new solar panels, according to a 2013 study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. A 2015 study led by a Stanford University researcher suggested that Indiana would save money by switching to renewables for all its energy needs.\n\nBut if Indiana’s rate of change over the last 10 years continues, power plants here will burn coal for decades to come.\n\n“It will be a gradual thing,” predicted A. David Stippler, Indiana’s utility consumer counselor. “Hopefully a prudent, well-thought-out transition.”\n\nThe pollution field trip\n\nFrom the back seat of a car, John Blair offered up acerbic commentary on the biggest air polluters of southwest Indiana. To your left, Duke Energy’s Gibson power plant and its coal-ash ponds. To your right, the little neighborhood where Duke provided bottled water to residents — later connecting them to a town water system — after the coal ash contaminated their wells.\n\nBlair is a 69-year-old photographer with a 1978 Pulitzer Prize, but what he’s known for now is his work as volunteer head of a small environmental group in Evansville called Valley Watch. In decades of agitating for cleaner air and water, he’s often pressed the power plants — and their regulators — to do better.\n\nThe first stop on Blair’s tour was Gibson, fourth-largest coal plant in the country by capacity. Located 25 miles northwest of Evansville, it released 2.9 million pounds of air pollutants in 2014, according to the toxics inventory — much of that the lung irritant sulfuric acid, which the EPA says contributes to the formation of fine particles. Lead, arsenic and mercury, all neurotoxins, added up to a collective 1,000 pounds that year as well. And Gibson released more greenhouse gases than all but three other sites — not just power plants — nationwide.\n\n“A godawful place,” Blair said, “that should be shut down.”\n\nDuke spokeswoman Angeline Protogere said the company has “significantly reduced emissions” at Gibson, installing more than $1 billion in environmental controls there over the past 20 years. Some of that was negotiated in a 2014 settlement after the EPA said it found violations. Toxics Release Inventory air emissions at Gibson have shrunk by three-quarters since 2006, including a 19 percent drop between 2014 and 2015, Protogere said. Greenhouse-gas emissions dropped by a third over the last decade as power generation also fell.\n\nDuke operates its plants “within EPA and state regulatory limits that are designed to protect public health and the environment,” she said.\n\nAfter Gibson came a stop at plants in Kentucky. Then back over the Ohio River into Indiana to see the looming, 1,038-foot stack at Rockport, tied for tenth-largest coal plant in the country.\n\nOwner American Electric Power was sued in 1999 by the EPA, environmental groups and eight states (Indiana not among them) over its emissions at coal plants. As part of the 2007 settlement, in which AEP did not admit any violations, the company was to have installed pollution controls on one Rockport unit by 2017 and on the other by 2019. But a 2013 rework of the settlement allowed the company to push that off another eight to nine years — in the meantime installing less-expensive, less-effective controls — in exchange for retiring units at coal plants outside the region.\n\nAEP spokeswoman Tammy Ridout said by email that Rockport “is among the most efficient power plants in the world, which means it uses less coal, and has fewer emissions, for each kilowatt of electricity generated.” AEP, she added, has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the emissions and environmental impact of the Rockport Plant,” including controls to cut mercury releases by about 80 percent.\n\nRockport, like Gibson, is on both of the Center’s top 100 lists, but neither is the region’s biggest producer of air pollution tracked by the Toxics Release Inventory. That distinction goes to the AES Corp.’s Petersburg power plant, 40 miles northeast of Evansville, which reported sending more chemicals into the air in 2014 than all but eight other sites nationwide. It’s also 35th for greenhouse gases. AES, hit with EPA violation notices for Petersburg in February and last year, said in a statement that it recently installed $450 million in pollution controls there, and “we comply with all environmental regulations.”\n\nBlair’s tour ended seven miles southeast of Evansville. There, the Warrick power plant run by Alcoa sits near F.B. Culley, one of two coal plants owned by the locally based Vectren Corp., which also co-owns part of Warrick. Vectren says its fleet is among the best controlled in the Midwest. Alcoa, whose complex is the fourth in southwest Indiana to make both top 100 lists, said it closed its smelter there in March and is running its power plant less now as a result.\n\nBlair paused at a cemetery overlooking the smokestacks.\n\n“You know,” he’d said earlier in the trip, “we’re subsidizing the coal industry big time with our health.”\n\n‘Incredibly powerful’ utilities\n\nIndiana utilities have influenced the state’s power mix beyond building coal plants in the first place. They gave a thumbs-up to ending mandatory state energy-efficiency targets, calling the program “very costly” for customers despite consumer-advocate support. They pressed for extra solar charges, contending that rooftop-solar customers shift costs to everyone else because they aren’t paying their fair share. (Some of the independent research on this national debate is in agreement; much of it is not.)\n\nThe Indiana Energy Association says the state doesn’t need mandatory energy-efficiency or renewable-energy targets — now common across the country — because its members are making so much progress voluntarily. Indiana ranked 42nd on the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s most recent state scorecard. It ranked 24th last year for the share of electricity generated with wind or solar, far outstripped by top states — half of them in the Midwest.\n\nUnless a state’s regulatory structure accounts for it, energy efficiency dampens utility revenues. So does customer-generated power. Some of Indiana’s utilities, including Evansville-based Vectren, specifically warn investors that these options are a financial threat.\n\nConsumer groups think the utilities — not the coal companies — make the most effective advocates for Indiana’s energy status quo.\n\n“They’ve always been an incredibly powerful voice in the General Assembly,” said Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana, and “they’ve drug their feet on any type of movement away from coal.”\n\nElectric utilities are among the largest corporate contributors to state elections in Indiana. They spent nearly 100 times as much as pro-environment groups in the past five years, and far more than mining companies, according to National Institute on Money in State Politics data.\n\nTheir state lobbying, which totals hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, includes spreading freebies around to legislators: dinners at McCormick & Schmick's, cocktails at Moe & Johnny’s, rounds of golf, tickets to Indiana Pacers and Indianapolis Colts games. Utilities are also the biggest donors to a state foundation that covers costs of economic-development travel for the governor.\n\nAmong the top recipients of their contributions and gifts is state Rep. Heath VanNatter, vice chair of the House Utilities and Energy Committee. He voted for the solar bill utilities wanted. He put forth the amendment that ultimately killed the energy-efficiency program. VanNatter, a Republican who represents an area north of Indianapolis, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe utilities say the transition away from coal is best handled at a measured pace. They’re increasing their use of alternatives, but a post-coal Indiana is a “long, long ways into the future,” said Maassel, president of the Indiana Energy Association, which opposes the EPA’s Clean Power Plan.\n\n“In anything, generally speaking, the faster you do it, the more expensive it becomes,” he said.\n\nMaassel said more than 730,000 Indiana households have after-tax incomes under $30,000 and pay a sizable chunk of that for energy, so utilities are mindful of the cost of change.\n\n“The existing facilities many times enjoy an economic advantage because they’ve been paid for to some level, and upgrading them with additional [pollution] controls … makes sense,” Maassel said.\n\nThis reasoning galls Kerwin Olson. He’s executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis consumer and environmental advocacy organization that often clashes with utilities. Olson contends that the most cost-effective option is to stop using coal sooner, not later.\n\nHe’s not talking about health and climate costs, though research suggests they make the true price of coal much higher. He means people’s actual utility bills.\n\n“If you’re a utility company with a guaranteed rate of return and the more you spend, the more you make, you’re going to choose the most expensive option,” he said. “That’s why we continue to rely almost exclusively on coal.”\n\nOlson said that while coal-plant pollution controls were once the cheapest option, that’s no longer the case. Efficiency and wind aren’t only cleaner but are also less expensive than coal, he said, while utility-scale solar is on par.\n\nThat’s clearly the case for new construction. Comparing piecemeal coal-plant retrofits to the alternatives is trickier, but David Schlissel with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which advocates for reduced dependence on fossil fuels, said many coal plants are uneconomic even without additional controls.\n\nCheaper electricity from gas and renewables prevents them from selling as much to the grid as they once did. In states such as Indiana where utilities own the plants, he said, ratepayers take the hit.\n\nUtility analyst Paul Patterson said power companies aren’t necessarily wedded to coal — some are moving aggressively on renewables. But it’s an industry that craves stability, said Patterson, with New York-based Glenrock Associates.\n\nAnd in states that have staked out pro-coal positions, he said, “there may be a whole variety of political issues” at play. AEP tells investors in its most recent annual report that it wants to rely more on natural gas, energy efficiency and renewables “where there is regulatory support.”\n\n‘Beyond Coal’ in coal country\n\nIn southwest Indiana, a future without coal would unpredictably reorder industries and people’s lives. Most of the state’s 6,500 mining jobs are here. They’re a small piece of the region’s employment — about 2 percent — but their reach is widened by the truck drivers, suppliers and others whose jobs depend on coal. Mining — like utilities — also provides some of the best-paying work. Property taxes from the power plant owners boost small-town budgets.\n\nAt the United Mine Workers of America’s old union hall in Boonville, 30 minutes from Evansville, a half-dozen retired coal miners gathered in June to talk about their anxieties — in particular their frustration that Congress had yet to vote on health and pension benefits endangered in the wake of coal-company bankruptcies. Some of the politicians loudly proclaiming themselves pro-coal are not beloved here.\n\nAll of these men worked at a Boonville surface mine that supplied a local coal plant and shut down in 1998, its closure blamed in part on the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. Marvin Bruner, who worked there 31 years, had to retire early and accept a smaller pension. Randal Underhill had to travel all over on construction jobs for power plants, living out of motels. David Hadley had to work in Indianapolis during the week and come home to his family on weekends.\n\nBut in this group, opinions of air-pollution regulation are nuanced. They’ve seen coal companies open new mines in the area since the Clean Air Act amendments — non-union ones. Bil Musgrave, 60, who contracted a rare bile-duct cancer he links to working amid hazardous waste dumped in the Boonville mine, is a Sierra Club member.\n\nHe feels the tension between the benefits and problems coal brings. You can’t be a miner without it, and yet Musgrave knows it’s burned to make far more electricity than his region needs. The Toxics Release Inventory figures for a nearby coal plant, he said, show “an enormous amount of pollution.”\n\nHadley, co-chair of the United Mine Workers’ Indiana political action committee and a former state utility regulatory commissioner, wishes the industry had pushed full speed ahead on clean-technology innovations 15 years ago. What if carbon capture were economically viable and widely used today? What good does switching to natural gas do, he says, if it doesn’t solve the carbon problem?\n\nHadley fears coal’s window of opportunity is all but closed. That would leave transition away from it as the only option — “a transition with consequences.”\n\nWendy Bredhold, a local Sierra Club representative, is a former Evansville city councilwoman who thinks about economic consequences, too. As the nation increasingly turns to renewables and big companies demand them, what will that mean for local growth prospects? Wouldn’t coal workers do better, she says, if state officials helped people with the transition instead of fighting it?\n\nThe Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign has notched successes across the country, preventing new plants from opening and convincing regulators that old plants weren’t cost effective and should close. An Indianapolis coal plant it targeted switched to natural gas this year.\n\nNow the group is campaigning in Evansville, trying to do this work in an area where, as Bredhold puts it, “coal runs generations deep.” An Evansville event the Sierra Club organized this month drew 100 people but also attracted angry Facebook comments.\n\nBredhold sees health problems and the accelerating effects of climate change, and doesn’t think she can afford to fail.\n\n“We can’t wait until these plants just can’t run anymore,” she said. “I want this transition to be as easy as it can be for my community, but it’s one that has to happen.”\n\nSecondhand pollution\n\nThe Cessna four-seater raced down a runway in Fort Meade, Maryland, loaded with equipment to measure ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases. For more than two decades, the Maryland Department of the Environment has tracked where pollutants come from. Agency scientists and university researchers have worked together to prove that other states routinely send unwanted contributions their way.\n\nThis isn’t academic. Pollution drifting over state lines complicates local efforts to clean the air.\n\nIndiana — 280 miles from Maryland at its nearest point — is one of the culprits, according to both Maryland and EPA analyses.\n\nCloser states have a bigger impact on Maryland, but the reach of Indiana’s pollutants is impressive. An EPA analysis for a 2011 rule to reduce power-plant emissions that exacerbate interstate problems with fine particles and ozone showed Indiana significantly contributing to air pollution in 11 states as far northeast as Connecticut. Only Kentucky topped that, at 12.\n\nTraveling pollution is why nine East Coast states petitioned the EPA in 2013 to make nine other states — Indiana among them — do more on ozone. That petition is pending; some officials told the EPA this year that they plan to sue to force a decision.\n\nIndiana and the other targeted states, in a 2014 letter to the EPA, said they’ve made “tremendous progress” on air quality and the petition’s arguments are out of date.\n\nDave Foerter, executive director of the Ozone Transport Commission, which advises the EPA on interstate smog problems, said meteorological conditions made for better years in 2013 and 2014. But generally, the wind blows Midwestern pollution to the Northeast, and that problem continues, he said.\n\n“Indiana tends to throw emissions a long way,” Foerter said.\n\nThat’s less likely to come from its cars than its power plants, because the plants’ smokestacks give pollutants the height they need to travel, according to Maryland regulators. New York, analyzing 2015 power-plant releases, discovered that Indiana put out four times as much nitrogen oxides — a key ozone ingredient — for every megawatt-hour of electricity as New York did.\n\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment’s Tad Aburn isn’t suggesting car-heavy Maryland doesn’t make its own pollution. It does, affecting three other states, according to the EPA’s analysis. But Maryland’s power-plant rules are stricter than federal ones, and Aburn says the agency’s detective work shows the air improves when states work together.\n\n“We need to do more,” he said.\n\nThe climate in Indiana\n\nClimate change, like air pollution, requires group efforts to combat. But in Indiana — where industrial greenhouse-gas emissions are second only to Texas in the United States and exceed those from Israel, Greece and 185 other countries — the official position is inertia.\n\nPence once called climate change a “myth” and now positions himself as a skeptic: “I think the science is very mixed on the subject,” he told MSNBC in 2009, an assertion he repeated until he said on the campaign trail this week that human activities have \"some impact\" on climate. Not only is his state suing over the Clean Power Plan, but he also vowed that Indiana won’t strategize to reduce greenhouse gases even if the rule does take effect. He’s an enthusiastic supporter of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group of companies and conservative lawmakers — popular in the Indiana state house — that has encouraged anti-climate initiatives.\n\nPolling shows more than half of Hoosiers say climate change is indeed happening, though, and that includes some local officials. Jim Brainard, a Republican from the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel, is among the Indiana mayors who see economic opportunities in the shifting energy landscape and are taking action in their cities.\n\nBut a variety of Indiana residents think statewide efforts are crucial, and they’re pressing officials to do something. What’s driving them is the knowledge that the science isn’t mixed on whether the world is warming, whether humans are largely to blame and whether that’s bad for us. The major point of debate among scientists now is just how bad it will be.\n\nLast fall Gabriel Filippelli coordinated a letter, signed by 23 Indiana academics, that urged Pence to draw on the educators’ in-state expertise on climate and its impacts. It recommended a plan for “mitigation and adaptation strategies … to protect energy and transportation infrastructure, the health of the public and economic development.”\n\n“It actually wasn’t intended to be political, but rather, ‘You have a lot of resources right here in Indiana, in your back yard, people who are expert in this and can give you better advice than maybe you’re receiving,’” said Filippelli, a professor of earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n\nHe said he got “zero” response from the Pence administration, which also did not answer the Center’s questions about the matter.\n\nAnita Wylie is trying a different tack. She’s suing.\n\nWylie, an attorney who once worked for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, is asking a trial court in Indianapolis to make the state develop a climate action plan. It’s something two-thirds of states now have, and it’s what the academics’ letter meant by mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\nA Pence spokeswoman did not respond to a question about the lawsuit, but the state argued in a motion to dismiss the case that it is not required to write a climate plan.\n\nWylie, now retired, says she is pursuing the lawsuit for her young grandsons and in memory of her father, a meteorologist deeply concerned about climate change.\n\n“Indiana’s my state,” she said. “I’m embarrassed by the positions that the government’s taken.”\n\nHopkins reported this story with the support of the Dennis A.

The jury found that local regulators were falling down on the job, that local elected officials were serving corporations rather than citizens, and that we needed to take immediate action to stem the tide of toxins in our community.\n\nThe grand jury issued an array of recommendations to improve pollution control, environmental monitoring, government accountability and other issues, but 20 years later, we're still seeing a lot of the same old problems.\n\nIn this special series, the News Journal will look at the state of our natural resources to help answer: Have we squandered paradise?\n\nPart 1: Escambia County haunted by legacy of pollution\n\nSometimes, the water stings her skin.\n\nSometimes, she comes out of the water smelling like a rotten egg.\n\nSometimes, she frets about how much time she allowed her five children to spend in the water, before she learned it was the terminus point for an industrial mill's waste.\n\nBut despite it all, Jackie Lane still swims in Perdido Bay.\n\n“I’d hate to live on such a beautiful body of water and not swim,” she said.\n\nA marine biologist, Lane has lived on the shores of the upper Perdido Bay since 1975. She and her late husband, Jim, built their home amid a swath of moss-covered trees a short walk from the bay's banks.\n\nFor more than a decade, they waded and swam and fished and raised a family, paying little mind to the industrial paper mill to the north. That was, Lane said, until foam, muck and dead fish washed up to her property in late 1986 and propelled her into a life-long battle to keep pollution out of her backyard bay.\n\nLane said it’s been mostly a losing battle.\n\nThe paper mill — whose ownership has changed hands three times since Lane arrived— has perpetually struggled to meet the emission standards mandated by the state, regardless of its owner. Since the 1960s, the mill has been cited as a likely cause of excessive nutrients, depressed oxygen levels, high levels of bacteria, elevated conductance and other problems in Eleven Mile Creek and Perdido Bay.\n\nStill, over the past 20 years alone, the mill’s owners have received approximately $14 million in tax breaks — a time frame when the mill has increased production but shed approximately 50% of its workforce. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has continually renewed and extended the mill’s operating permit regardless of whether it was in compliance.\n\nVoicing her frustration with the whole system, Lane said, “They want you to think that they’re regulated. That the government is protecting you. They’re not.”\n\n'Those responsible for protecting, maintaining, and improving the environment, did not do so'\n\nEscambia County certainly isn't the only place in America with pollution problems, but the severity of our environmental issues would likely surprise folks who just know us for our beautiful beaches.\n\nEach year in our area, approximately 35 million pounds of industrial waste are emitted into the air, discharged to local surface waters or deposited underground, according to data from the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nCurrently, of 893 metropolitan areas across the U.S., the Pensacola area ranks No. 12 for the total toxic releases per square mile.\n\nOur local landscape is pockmarked with chemical mills and plants that are still leeching toxins into our soil, creeks, bayous and bays decades after the owners packed up and moved on.\n\nCitizens have long been at the front lines of the battle to safeguard our environment, and in 1999, citizens raised such vocal concern about the state of the local environment that then-State Attorney Curtis Golden — with approval from First Judicial Circuit Chief Judge John Kuder — assembled a special grand jury to review the area’s air and water quality.\n\nAfter 10 months of research and expert testimony, the grand jury ultimately concluded what many had long alleged: “Regulators, in general, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, in particular, who were responsible for protecting, maintaining, and improving the environment, did not do so.\"\n\nThe report noted that even though regulators sometimes disagreed about which specific factors were most significant in causing local pollution, they all knew the causes and effects of pollution in our community.\n\n\"Instead of acting to protect, maintain and improve the environment, regulators have done more studies, duplicating previous work,\" the report said. \"They have substituted studies for action, because studies are less costly, and less controversial, than acting to improve or restore the environment.”\n\nThe grand jury ultimately issued 27 recommendations for the county to improve and protect its natural resources.\n\nFrom the timely processing of permits and enforcement of regulations, to more robust sampling and monitoring protocols, to a recommended moratorium on new surface water discharges, to comprehensive stormwater drainage plans, to a call to make dereliction of duty by a public officer a criminal offense, the grand jury offered a wealth of suggestions intended to help the county clean up its act.\n\nMany of the recommendations have been attempted or implemented to some degree, but the sweeping changes the grand jury likely envisioned haven't come to pass.\n\n'Escambia County is a greatly polluted place'\n\nWe've had some big, bombastic environmental disasters like the Saufley Landfill fire that burned for approximately four months in 2005 and 2006, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 that sent 97% of the oil that washed ashore in Florida to Pensacola Beach and the 2017 International Paper spill explosion that covered nearby Cantonment neighborhoods in sticky, black debris.\n\nBut in many instances, our most damaging environmental issues didn't come with fires and flash and fury.\n\nHistorically, our biggest polluters have simply walked into government offices and applied for permits.\n\nThere are six Superfund sites in the county — areas that have been contaminated by heavy industry and marked for cleanup by the federal government. For context, there are seven states in the U.S that have six or fewer Superfund sites.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2008, more than 400 households were permanently relocated from the Clarinda Triangle area in Pensacola because of concerns regarding dioxin and other pollutants.\n\nUnderground plumes of toxic chemicals have migrated into Bayou Texar, forcing the closure of some private irrigation wells and contamination of sediments in the bayou.\n\nUnfortunately, the list of issues goes on and on.\n\n\"Escambia County is a greatly polluted place from historical mistakes and current ongoing mistakes,\" said Linda Young, founder of the Florida Clean Water Network.\n\nStill, government officials and environmental regulators stress that these are largely legacy issues from Pensacola's history as one of Florida's first industrialized cities.\n\nAs resources have allowed, municipalities, utilities and industries have built up a network of air scrubbers, water filtration systems, monitoring and sampling programs, restoration projects and other initiatives to help keep citizens safe and our natural resources clean.\n\n\"We’re continually marching forward with a series of programs that are incrementally making things better,\" said Tim Day, Escambia County environmental programs manager.\n\nHalf a billion dollar investment in environment\n\nWe've made clear progress in some areas.\n\nIt took until 2012, but Emerald Coast Utilities Authority's downtown sewage plant — dubbed \"Old Stinky\" by locals — was relocated, sparking a downtown development boom that is still picking up steam.\n\nAdditionally, ECUA has been working to help citizens remove or safely abandon thousands of septic tanks that leaked waste and bacteria into surface and ground waters. Likewise, the Florida Department of Health in Escambia County has been systematically removing underground petroleum tanks left behind by shuttered filling stations.\n\nThe city and county have leaned into efforts to improve the area's stormwater infrastructure.\n\nOver the past five years, the city of Pensacola has invested $33 million into stormwater management projects, and previously invested heavily into box culverts to trap trash and debris that made its way into surface waters.\n\nEscambia County has invested about $125 million in BP oil spill settlement funds into environmental projects, as well as close to $180 million in Local Option Sales Tax dollars on drainage and dirt road paving projects.\n\nIn a statement, current paper mill owner International Paper said, \"In 2010, International Paper set 12 voluntary sustainability goals aimed at improving our impact on people and the planet. In alignment with these sustainability goals and with approval from (DEP), International Paper completed a comprehensive $70 million improvement project that upgraded the Pensacola mill’s effluent treatment plant, constructed a 10-mile pipeline for treated wastewater to eliminate discharge into Eleven Mile Creek, restored historic wetlands, and reduced water consumption through the use of municipal reclaim water.\"\n\nThe DEP reports providing close to $118 million in loans and grants related to water quality projects in Escambia County.\n\nJessica Bibza, the National Wildlife Foundation's Florida and Alabama policy specialist, said she believes overall, Escambia County has turned a corner.\n\n\"(After the grand jury report) I think a light bulb went off, and there was a concerted effort to invest in projects and programs and efforts that will help environment water quality and legacy issues,\" Bibza said. \"... I don’t buy into the 'corrupt Escambia County' theory at all. There may be some lingering old ways of doing business, but I see a lot of people who are really passionate about improving the county and the county's water.\"\n\nMany local citizens and environmentalists allege that too often, government entities only take action when problems get too big to ignore, and even then are rarely effective in tackling root causes or holding polluters accountable.\n\nStill more work ahead\n\nNot all of our troubles are behind us, however.\n\nTake for instance the Wedgewood area, a middle-class black neighborhood that found itself with a new landfill for a neighbor in 1990.\n\nAs the years have passed, residents began complaining that the landfill that was polluting their groundwater and air, reducing their quality of life and property values, and causing respiratory illness and cancer.\n\nIn 2011, the landfill was found in violation for storing unauthorized wastes and failing to have a valid remedial action plan. Over the next few years, the facility continued to rack up violations for contaminating ground and surface waters, failing to reduce \"objectionable odors\" and failing to have financial assurances in place for corrective actions.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling, the landfill's permit was revoked in 2015. In 2016, the DEP was granted a judgement requiring the landfill owners to provide $566,000 in financial assurances for closing the landfill and $38,000, plus interest, in fines. To date, the contaminants on the landfill haven't been properly contained and DEP is still seeking payment.\n\nSeparately in Santa Rosa County, it took months of public badgering to get the local government, the DEP and the Department of Transportation to take action on citizen concerns of red clay being washed into Indian Bayou during a state road project.\n\nAnd in Perdido Bay, citizens have spent decades calling for the owners of the International Paper mill to come into full compliance with the Clean Water Act.\n\nLane, who is head of the Friends of Perdido Bay environmental group, said, \"we're not fighting the mill, we're fighting the government.\"\n\n'Meets all government standards?'\n\nA consistent complaint remains among citizens that officials are still prone to putting industry ahead of citizens, to taking a reactive approach to conservation and enforcement, and to obfuscating the true extent of our environmental issues.\n\nA common refrain from area leadership is that local industries comply with state and federal standards.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Enforcement and Compliance History Online website indicates there are 51 facilities in Escambia County that have violated the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act or other environmental standards within the past three years.\n\nThe list includes all three of the county's biggest dischargers — Ascend Performance Materials, International Paper and Gulf Power's Crist Plant — and several municipal facilities including ECUA and the town of Century's wastewater treatment plants and Escambia County's solid waste management plant.\n\nTracking state-level violations is a much more difficult process, as the DEP's public and official database \"OCULUS\" is notoriously nightmarish to navigate even for those who know specifically what they are looking for.\n\nThe Northwest Florida District of the DEP declined multiple requests to be interviewed by the News Journal, but sent emailed responses to inquiries about its responsiveness to the 1999 grand jury recommendations.\n\n\"The department takes its mission to protect, conserve and manage Florida’s natural resources and enforce its environmental laws very seriously,\" a statement from the agency said. \"We are tasked with the important responsibility of ensuring our regulated facilities operate in a manner that is protective of the environment. Along with state and federal rules and statutes, permits issued by DEP establish criteria and conditions that help protect and preserve Florida’s air and water quality while also supporting a vibrant economy.\"\n\nStill, alongside the many environment-specific recommendations the grand jury made in 1999, several recommendations were aimed at DEP processes and culture.\n\nThe report notes that state and federal law allows industries to continue operating beyond the life of their original permit — regardless of whether they are in compliance — as long as they are timely in applying to renew their permit. Arguing that the process allowed polluters to operate in perpetuity, the grand jury noted that at the time of its report in 1999, the paper mill was on a state permit that had been issued in 1982 and scheduled to expire in 1987.\n\nNot much has changed today, as the mill is operating on a 2010 permit that was set to expire in 2015, but was recently \"administratively continued\" into 2020.\n\nAnother issue raised in the report is that DEP uses compliance monitoring to measure the success of its air and water pollution control systems, but the monitoring only determines compliance with permit conditions and not the actual health of, or risk to, the populace or the environment.\n\n\"When we speak in terms of water quality, in broad stokes one of the very first things you look at is nutrient levels,\" Wade Jeffrey, a distinguished professor of the University of West Florida and director of the university's Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Bioremediation, said in explaining the purpose and limitations of sampling.\n\n\"Water clarity can be a real critical component, oxygen is another big one, and there are others, but it doesn’t get into looking for specific toxins. So if you're really paranoid and worried about a particular pollutant, standard water quality measures don’t (look for) that.\"\n\nLiving at the end of the pipe\n\nMany local environmentalists are deeply concerned about contaminants for which standard testing may not be screening.\n\nYoung, with the Florida Clean Water Network, long championed for regulation of PFOA and PFOS, a dangerous toxin commonly found in firefighting foams. The DEP has \"cleanup target levels\" for the substances, but no formal regulations.\n\nIn a recent report, Washington nonprofit corporation Environmental Working Group released a drinking water report that claimed that while ECUA is within all state and federal drinking water standards there are eight contaminants — including PFOA and PFOS — that exceed standards the organization recommends.\n\nBarbara Albrecht, a marine biologist and a longtime member of the Bream Fisherman's Association, raised concerns about a lack of transparency regarding what's in our environment and how it's monitored.\n\nBetween McDavid Creek at the north end of the county and Pensacola and Perdido bays in the south, there are 14 local water bodies listed on the DEP's \"impaired\" list.\n\nStanding near the shore of Bruce Beach — a downtown park that has recently been reclaimed for public use — Albrecht noted that despite plans to redevelop the area into a major community park, no one is talking about the fact that the area is next door to the former site of ECUA's old wastewater treatment plant, and the water is still plagued by high levels of bacteria.\n\n\"If I don't know the history, I’m gonna come out here and go fishing,\" Albrecht said. \"I'm gonna catch something, and I’m going to go home and eat it. But if I saw a sign that said 'Catch fish but release because we're treating this area for water quality issues,' that would be honest. You can find that information on the Department of Health's website, but it's buried. Why?\"\n\nAnd Lane is worried about what's below the surface of her backyard bay, particularly dioxin and heavy metals she said are accumulating in sludge that sinks to the bottom and isn't being tested.\n\nLane runs a website and a regular newsletter for citizens and neighbors who are interested in the health of Perdido Bay, keeping them updated on pH levels, sampling results and historical data.\n\nShe's been watching with interest to see if new standards DEP has asked of International Paper — including a $131,000 settlement and $1,000 per day fines when the mill is in violation — actually stick.\n\nLane acknowledges that industry is a necessity, and pollution was an unfortunate byproduct of things we need like electricity, nylon, roads and, yes, paper.\n\nBut still, “Living at the end of the pipe changes your outlook totally,\" Lane said. \"People say we need paper, and we do, but not like this.”\n\nPart 2: What's really lurking in the water at Perdido Bay?\n\nWhat do we know about the state of Perdido Bay?\n\nStudio 850, a non-partisan, citizen-led journalism initiative, has been investigating the history of Perdido Bay in a multi-part documentary called \"Have We Lost Perdido Bay?\"\n\nThe documentary features interviews with independent scientists and people who have spent years living on the bay and believe it's in dire shape. That notion has sparked fierce resistance from local government, particularly Escambia County Commissioners Doug Underhill and Jeff Bergosh, who have set out to debunk the group's work.\n\nBergosh toured International Paper's mill in Cantonment — long believed to the chief source of the bay's contamination — and later posted photos of himself having a successful day crabbing in the bay.\n\nUnderhill made his point by drinking a glass of saltwater from the bay.\n\nNonetheless, there is no question that the bay has water quality issues.\n\nThe Northwest Florida Water Management District issued a Surface Water Improvement and Management plan for the Perdido River and Bay in October 2017.\n\nThe SWIM plan indicates that DEP has broken the the Perdido River and Bay watershed into 72 distinct sections known as segments.\n\nDEP had identified 27 impaired segments with 32 total impairments, including 22 segments for mercury in fish tissue, six segments for bacteria (five for fecal coliforms and one for number of beach advisories), one segment for turbidity (cloudiness), and three segments for dissolved oxygen. Some segments had more than one pollutant.\n\nThe upper bay is currently on the DEP's list of \"impaired\" water bodies because samples have repeatedly returned high levels of enterococci bacteria. Enterococci are not typically considered harmful to humans, but their presence may be an indicator for other disease-causing agents such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa.\n\nA 1993 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study of sediment toxicity found the Perdido Bay system was generally free of toxic compounds, but noted that certain segments were contaminated with toxic organic compounds and metals — to include high levels of the carcinogen dioxide in Eleven Mile Creek's sediment.\n\nToday, the bay is considered a high-priority for a total maximum daily load study, which would determine the levels of various contaminants the bay can safely absorb.\n\nEscambia County staff have been adamant that water quality in the bay has been improving in recent years.\n\nDespite the concerns of community-driven groups like Friends of Perdido Bay and Studio 850, the county's top scientist, Chips Kirschenfeld, director of the Department of Natural Resources Management, said there is nothing in recent data that gives him any concerns.\n\n\"Yes, IP has water quality issues,\" he said. \"Certainly, we get the annual reports and I go over those, and I share that data with the county administrator. I tell them about any water quality violations, and I'm fair about it and I point out that 'yes, there are these violations, but they are at the end of the pipe that discharges into the wetlands.' It travels through 14,000 feet, 2.5 miles of wetlands where it receives additional treatment before it gets to Perdido Bay.\"\n\nHe emphasized, \"All of the data that I’ve seen is acceptable, with no violations of any standards that would make it unsafe for swimming and recreational use.\"\n\nStill, even residents are divided about the Bay's safety\n\nFor the uninitiated, Perdido Bay is a shallow, vaguely hour-glass shaped water body on the Florida-Alabama border. Its upper bay and lower bay are split roughly in half by U.S. 98. The upper bay doesn't \"flush\" well, meaning things that wind up in the bay tend to stay there rather than get washed out into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe bay is fed primarily from the northwest by the freshwater Perdido River, but a smaller stream, Eleven Mile Creek, terminates at the north-northeastern tip of the bay.\n\nWhen the paper mill first opened in 1941 as the Florida Pulp and Paper Co., the mill's effluent was discharged directly into Eleven Mile Creek. This continued until 2012, when International Paper completed a 10-mile pipeline that feeds effluent south into a 1,400-acre treatment wetland. There, the effluent meanders through the wetlands over three to four days before eventually flowing into lower Eleven Mile Creek and then to the upper bay.\n\n\"It is important to note that regulatory compliance is demonstrated at the mill site, prior to discharge to the effluent transmission pipeline,\" IP noted in a written statement to the News Journal. \"The wetlands are not relied upon for primary treatment; however, they do add value to the overall system by further refining effluent quality.\"\n\nThe shoreline around the bay is dotted with little communities and subdivisions — Bay Forest, Ramsey Beach, Perdido Terrace and so on — and from his new dock in Ramsey Beach, Steve Swiler can see it all.\n\nA Louisiana native with a big personality, a slight Cajun accent and a passion for LSU football, Swiler and his wife, Connie, like to tie inflatable chairs to their dock and melt into the water.\n\n\"The water, the beauty of it all,\" Swiler said, describing what brought his family to Ramsey Beach five years ago. \"It's just beautiful out here.\"\n\nHe didn't know about the bay's history when he moved in, and it doesn't bother him much. Swiler is president of the area homeowner's association, and he champions the neighborhood as an indisputably great place to live.\n\nHaving a beer on the dock with his neighbor John Schleich, an elder statesman of the community, there was a faint tension as Schleich gave a much bleaker assessment of the bay.\n\nSchleich has lived in Ramsey Beach since 1985, and in the late '80s he was a part of a fleet of Friends of Perdido Bay volunteers who would go out on boats and collect samples at monitoring stations around the bay. He said he remembers local fisherman catching flounder and redfish from their docks, but as time went on they had to take boats out of Perdido Bay to bring in decent hauls.\n\n\"My wife wouldn't swim in it,\" Schleich said of the upper bay. \"She wouldn't eat the fish out of it. We had a son who was 5 or 6 at the time, and she wouldn't let him swim in it.\"\n\nSwiler stressed that he and Connie weren't afraid to go in, and they agreed they sometimes see dolphins breach the flat, glassy surface or bait fish swimming underfoot.\n\nStill, Connie said, \"I would like to know more. If there is pollution, where it comes from and if there's any danger. I'm in it all the time, so I want to know about it.\"\n\nWhat is the paper mill worth to the community?\n\nAt the time a grand jury reviewed Escambia County's air and water quality back in 1999, the permit on Champion International's paper mill was supposed to have expired 12 years prior.\n\n\"Through all 12 years ... Champion has not complied with state water quality standards and permit conditions,\" the grand jury noted in its final report.\n\nNonetheless, the permit was effectively transferred over to a new owner, International Paper, which today is operating on a permit that was issued in 2010 and scheduled to expire in 2015. It has been \"administratively continued\" through at least 2020 — despite the fact the paper mill is still not in compliance.\n\nThe state has proposed charging IP $131,000 in civil penalties, and an additional penalty of $1,000 per day for each day the mill is not in compliance. The DEP and IP remain in negotiations regarding the terms of the consent order.\n\n\"That should be interesting,\" Jackie Lane, president of the Friends of Perdido Bay, said of the negotiations. Whether the state will institute regulations with some proverbial teeth, \"that will be the litmus test.\"\n\nThe 1999 grand jury dedicated a large chunk of its final report to the paper mill, noting its review of DEP records revealed \"neither (previous mill owners) Champion, nor St. Regis, ever fully met state water quality standards. We found instead a pattern of violations, studies and promises to improve, followed by more violations, more studies and more promises and so forth — all of which was accommodated and or constructively approved by (state regulators).\"\n\nThe DEP declined multiple request for an interview with the News Journal, but issued written responses to general questions. The agency noted, \"along with state and federal rules and statutes, permits issued by DEP establish criteria and conditions that help protect and preserve Florida’s air and water quality while also supporting a vibrant economy.\"\n\nThe paper mill received about $14 million in tax breaks as it shed hundreds of jobs\n\nThe mill has historically been the biggest employers in the Cantonment area, and in 1999 it reportedly employed about 1,200 people, provided approximately $80 million in payroll and paid $3.5 million in taxes to Escambia County.\n\nToday, the Pensacola mill employs more than 500 team members and 100 daily onsite contractors, according to International Paper. The total economic impact is estimated to be $300 million, with an annual payroll of $54 million. The mill contributes more than $3.7 million annually in state and local taxes.\n\nThe mill is also a critical customer of local timber growers. A 2017 economic impact study for the Florida Forestry Association says Escambia County's forestry industry creates more than 5,600 jobs and $38 million in state and local taxes.\n\nAccording to records and estimates from the Escambia County Property Appraiser's Office, the mill has seen three tax hefty tax exemptions since 1999 for \"new\" operations.\n\nIn 1999, the mill received a seven-year, approximately $1.2 million Economic Development Ad Valorem Tax Exemption for improvements that increased production by 66,500 tons and added 25 new jobs.\n\nThere was another $1.8 million EDATE in 2001 when IP expanded operations at a McDavid facility, but the exemption was terminated early when IP sold the facility.\n\nIn 2008, IP was granted a 10-year EDATE allowing the company to avoid approximately $11 million in taxes when it expanded production to include a new line for brown rolled paper products.\n\nThe mill is a cultural touchstone for many residents whose fathers and grandfathers worked in the facility, delivered or harvested lumber. Mill staff can often be found at local ribbon cuttings and fundraisers.\n\n\"The mill has been actively involved in the local community, helping International Paper’s goal to protect and improve the lives of team members and the communities where we live and work by focusing on our signature causes of education, hunger, health and wellness, and disaster relief,\" the company's statement said. \"Over the last five years, the IP and the Pensacola Mill has contributed close to $600,000 to organizations in Escambia County. IP provides impactful assistance, face-to-face interactions and offers resources for our community beyond just financial contributions.\"\n\nAn ecological study of Perdido Bay has been a point of contention\n\nResidents, environmental regulators, mill representatives. politicians and scientists have disputed if and how much pollution the mill causes since the 1960s.\n\nIn terms of life in the bay, a National Wetlands Research Center study found the Perdido Bay lost roughly 75% of its seagrass beds between 1940 and 1992 — a decrease from 1,204 acres to 319 acres — more than any other bay on the Gulf Coast, according to the grand jury report.\n\nThe grand jury also noted various sources had reported declines in the quantity and diversity of sea-bed dwelling organisms like marine worms, snails and bivalves.\n\nIn 2014, the county implemented the Eleven Mile Creek Bacteria Pollution Control Plan which includes monthly monitoring at six points along Eleven Mile Creek for bacteria, temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity (cloudiness). All of the points are above the paper mill's treatment wetland.\n\nIn 2018, the Friends of Perdido Bay, a community organization dedicated to protecting the watershed, commissioned an ecological survey of the bay.\n\nThe surveyor, a consulting and professional services firm called Cardno, took bottom samples from upper Perdido Bay and nearby Tee and Wicker Lakes, as well as trawled the bodies of water for life.\n\nCardno reported a low abundance of macroinvertebrates at both the bay and lake stations. Trawling produced an abundance of juvenile spot fish, and small quantities of other aquatic life such as brown shrimp, the gulf menhaden and the bay anchovy.\n\nCardno's report also noted that at depths below 1.5 meters (about five feet) the level of dissolved oxygen in upper Perdido Bay decreased rapidly, while the level of salinity increased rapidly.\n\n\"Ponar (bottom) grab samples, when brought to the surface, expressed a strong hydrogen sulfide (H2S) odor,\" the report said. \"Collectively, this information strongly suggests that bottom sediments within the Upper Bay were in a near anoxic state during the period of sampling.\"\n\nPut simply, the surveyors found there was little to no oxygen on the bottom of the bay, which limits the potential for life there.\n\nThe report listed a number of factors that could have contributed to the survey results, from spawning cycles, to the seasonal warming of estuarine waters, to extreme fluctuations in salinity.\n\nThe report advised that a single point-in-time survey was not enough data to draw any conclusions and there needed to be more ongoing studies coupled with historical data to establish any meaningful trends.\n\nStill, the abundance of fish caught has been cited by Escambia County Commissioner Doug Underhill and senior scientist Chips Kirschenfeld as evidence the bay's health is improving, and claims of the bay's death were greatly exaggerated.\n\n\"They remember the way it was 25 years ago,\" Kirschenfeld said. \"I was one of the people making these kinds of statements 25 years, ago. But nature has a wonderful way of healing themselves, if we take away the impacts and problems, which is what we've done over the last 20 years.\"\n\nLane however, noted that the lack of diversity in the bay was troubling, and she said it would be comparable to going into your backyard and finding an abundance of squirrels, but no birds or worms, or bugs, or other life.\n\nShe said that while there's been sampling of the water quality, there was no monitoring of sludge that was settling at the bottom of the bay.\n\n\"That stuff does not break down, it’s going to be there forever,\" she said. \"These mills have never controlled their sludges. They’ve never been made to.\"\n\nSo is Perdido Bay dying or on the mend? New estuary program could provide answers\n\nKirschenfeld said there is no one \"canary in the coal mine\" that could provide a simple litmus test for whether or not Perdido Bay is healthy.\n\nThere have been dozens of studies over the decades, but they've largely been siloed affairs that have ended up on storage shelves.\n\n\"One would have to compile numerous studies that have been been done by DEP, the (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), the Northwest Florida Water Management District and monitoring data that (IP environmental consultants) Nutter and Associates collects. Take all of that data and look through it all, try to come up with a conclusion based on that data.\"\n\nStill, local stakeholders are hopeful a new program may be able to do just that.\n\nIn 2018, the EPA gave Escambia County $2 million in grant funding to establish the Pensacola and Perdido Bays Estuary Program, a collaborative program that will bring together a consortium of local, state and federal experts to try and determine how to protect and restore the two estuary systems.\n\nThe initiative is off to a bit of a rocky start, as the director of the program, Jim Trifilio suddenly announced his resignation.\n\nJessica Bibza, chair of the programs technical committee, said the organization's will soldier on, and hopefully add some clarity to a discussion of Perdido Key she believes has drifted too much into hyperbole.\n\n\"We’re hoping to do an inventory of a bunch of these plans and identify the common themes,\" Bibza said. \"That's where we’re going to start, at the end of the first day, with yet another report that is going to list these priorities and recommend grant projects.\"\n\nShe continued, \"But the next day, what we’re going to need is local government to come forward and say, 'we're going to take on this one and commit to making it happen. We'll have to have the continued commitment from local government, but we got this far with really great support from Escambia and Santa Rosa counties.\"\n\nPart 3: Escambia County confronts pollution sins of the past\n\nAn Escambia County grand jury in 1999 stated in no uncertain terms: the people who were supposed to be protecting the environment were failing.\n\nThe grand jury's 120-page final report accused regulators of ignoring and concealing violations, of bowing to industry and business rather than serving the public, of squandering the area's precious resources for fleeting gain and of mocking and maligning the citizens' groups that tried to fill the void left by government inaction.\n\nThe grand jury made 27 recommendations for improving the state of our environment, which can generally be divided into four categories: policy, monitoring, pollution control and accountability. Most were directed at the Department of Environmental Protection, though some were applicable to local government, state legislators and even the public at large.\n\nThe pollution control recommendations are probably of the most importance to most citizens, and unfortunately, the most complex to gauge and implement.\n\nSins of the past still weigh heavy on Escambia County\n\nHistorically, the mantra for dealing with dirty industry was \"the solution to pollution is dilution.\" It was essentially a theory that we could dump industrial waste into rivers, bays and lakes, and the water bodies were too big and self-replenishing to suffer any substantial harm.\n\nOf course, many now argue that diluting contaminants isn't the same as deleting them, and the accumulation of toxins in our bays, beaches and bayous has done immense harm over time.\n\n\"One of the issues with being one of the oldest communities in Florida is ultimately we saw development ahead of a lot of other areas,\" said Tim Day, Escambia County environmental programs manager. \"Our waterways were where you industrialized, because that's where your transportation routes were.\"\n\nToday, the DEP's list of impaired waterways includes 14 Escambia County water bodies, to include northern and southern Escambia Bay, the northern and middle segments of Pensacola Bay, upper Perdido Bay and many others.\n\nAdditionally, a DEP water quality map indicates most of our local surface waters — bayous Chico, Texar and Marcus, Carpenter Creek, Eleven Mile Creek and many more — fall below state standards and struggle with issues like high bacteria levels, low oxygen levels and excessive nutrient levels.\n\nMany of these issues can be traced back to the many chemical treating plants that have historically dotted the local landscape. We currently have six Superfund sites in Escambia County, highly contaminated former industry sites where decades of processing and manufacturing stained the underlying soil and groundwater with toxins.\n\nOne of the grand jury recommendations in 1999 was that the DEP calculate the \"total maximum daily loads\" for local impaired water bodies — the threshold limits on pollutants for individual water bodies.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the DEP developed TMDLs for the Bayou Chico Watershed, Escambia Bay and Perdido Bay, Eleven Mile, Ten Mile and Carpenter's creeks and others.\n\nIn 2011, the DEP and numerous partners completed the Bayou Chico Basin Management Action Plan, more than 50 projects intended to achieve restoration of the watershed, including Jones Creek, Jackson Creek, Maggie's Ditch, Bayou Chico Beach and Sanders Beach.\n\n\"To a certain extent, we do still deal with those legacy contaminants,\" said Chips Kirschenfeld, the county's senior scientist and head of the Department of Natural Resources Management.\n\n\"For example, one of the projects we're working on now is to clean up the contaminated sediments in Bayou Chico. That's one of the BP-funded projects. Those contaminants go back 100 years probably, and here we are today, we're going to be spending $20 million probably before it's all done, maybe more, to try to correct those sins of the past.\"\n\nA 2018 annual report on the statewide status of BMAP, TMDL and other initiatives, reported that from August 2011 through December 2018, 83 Bayou Chico projects had been reported as completed. The initiatives have ranged from dredging, to stormwater improvements at nearby parks, to an environmental symposium at the University of West Florida.\n\nNonetheless, beach advisories — health warnings issued in response to elevated levels of bacteria, algal blooms and other problems — are used as a gauge for BMAP efficacy. The annual report indicates that every year between Jan. 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018, Bayou Chico Beach exceeded the allowable 20 days of beach advisories per year.\n\nSanders Beach exceeded the number of advisory days allowed twice in the 7.5-year span.\n\nLinda Young, the former director of the Florida Clean Water Network, has repeatedly sued at the state and federal level for tougher water quality regulations. She believes that for all the talk of standards and protections, regulators aren't proactive enough at preventing problems, or tough enough on polluters to solve problems when they are identified.\n\nFor all the recent activity to battle algae blooms in South Florida, the problem was a product of years and years of inaction.\n\nShe said for regulators to take any meaningful action at a polluted watershed, \"It has to have pretty much collapsed.\"\n\nEPA data shows we still release more toxins than almost anywhere else in America\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's annual Toxics Release Inventory, the Pensacola metro area currently has the country's 12th highest rate of toxic releases per square mile.\n\nThe vast majority of these releases come from a handful of heavy industries in Cantonment: Ascend Performance Materials, a nylon manufacturing plant; the International Paper paper mill; and Gulf Power's Crist electric plant.\n\nThose industries, along with a few others, release about 35 million pounds of waste each year. According to officials, upward of 95% of chemicals are treated before the waste is released, but emissions still contain potentially harmful substances such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methanol and formaldehyde.\n\nWater emissions may also contain nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrient-rich materials that can feed algae blooms.\n\nIn 1999, the grand jury recommended that DEP attempt to cut down on pollution by refusing to grant any new expanded or relocated waste discharges in Escambia County.\n\nWhile DEP has permitted two new discharges in the intervening 20 years, the agency reports there has been a net decrease in discharge points.\n\nThere were 11 permitted discharges within Escambia County in 1999, five of which are no longer in operation.\n\nNaval Air Station Pensacola connected its wastewater treatment facility to the Emerald Coast Utilities Authority's in 2009; the Main Street Wastewater Treatment Plant was relocated in 2012; and the respective discharges of Saufley Field Sewage Treatment Plant, Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Nitrous Oxide Corp. have all been closed or diverted into other wastewater treatment systems.\n\nThe two new discharges are a new central water reclamation facility that was permitted in 2007 to replace the Main Street plant, and a new ECUA subaqueous cleaning line for potable water mains.\n\nFive of the remaining dischargers have improved their treatment processes since 1999, according to the DEP (the department is currently processing a new permit for the sixth discharger, the town of Century).\n\nInternational Paper discharged its effluent directly into Eleven Mile Creek at the time of the grand jury report, but has since installed an approximately 1,300-acre wetland intended to filter its effluent before it hits the river.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports International Paper has been in violation of the Clean Water Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters.\n\nIn regards to Ascend, the DEP reports it issued an administrative order in 2001 that prompted Solutia to eliminate the surface water discharge of wastewater from multiple points within its facility, resulting in a non-process wastewater only discharge to surface water.\n\nHowever, Ascend Performance Materials has been in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act for eight of the past 12 quarters and in noncompliance with the Clean Water Act for seven of the past 12 quarters, according to the EPA.\n\nGulf Power's 2018 permit included increased monitoring requirements. Also, Gulf Power is a reuse customer for ECUA, using approximately 6 million gallons per day of reuse water in their air scrubber system, according to DEP.\n\nThe Crist Mill had two quarters of noncompliance in the past three years, according to EPA data.\n\nECUA's respective treatment plants are at Pensacola Beach and Bayou Marcus, Gulf Power's Crist Plant, Ascend Performance Materials LLC and International Paper.\n\nRussell Edgar, the now-retired assistant state attorney who led the grand jury investigation in 1999, said part of the problem with tracking the health issues caused by pollution is that they are hard to isolate from other causes.\n\n\"There have been multiple studies at (the University of West Florida) about this issue,\" Edgar said. \"They were focused largely on health issues, which are very difficult to measure because of the way people move around and because of other factors such as personal habits, diets and so forth, it's hard to tell just what connection there is between the pollution here and the health outcomes.\"\n\nUWF and numerous health agencies conducted health studies about the effect of pollution\n\nAfter the grand jury report, UWF — with federal funding and the assistance of the Department of Health, Florida State University, the University of South Florida and the Georgia Institute of Technology — studied the local impacts of pollution.\n\nThe studies, which stretched from 2002 to 2009, included an analysis of whether proximity to discharge sites affected human health outcomes. A summary of the study noted, \"this study did not find clear evidence for an influence of proximity to emission sites on 'cumulative' health at the zip code level.\"\n\nStudies also looked at the pollution of soil in public places such as parks, playgrounds and sports fields at 126 locations in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. While they found elevated levels of toxins near some legacy pollution sites, they generally found the ground didn't pose a health hazard.\n\nStill, the report noted that ZIP codes with high incidences of specific outcomes like cardiac disease, lung cancer, asthma and pneumonia tended to have higher proximity to emission sources. The report recommended that the specific causes of these higher health risks — particularly in infants, the elderly, the black community and the poor — needed to be further investigated and addressed.\n\nThat follow-up work hasn't occurred.\n\nAdditionally, the universities used hair samples to measure the mercury levels in women of child-bearing age. They found about 95 of the 602 women sampled (some 16%) had hair mercury levels exceeding the U.S. EPA's advisory level. Of the 95, roughly 60% had eaten more than three seafood meals in the prior 30 days.\n\nThe Department of Health launched a campaign to raise awareness of fish consumption advisories that included billboards, news releases and wallet cards, but over the years, those efforts have tapered off to postings on the DOH website.\n\nCurrently, young children and women of child-bearing age are urged not to eat freshwater fish, with the exception of a handful of species, more than once a month to limit mercury exposure.\n\nEdgar noted, \"we still have problems with the water, and anybody who fishes or goes out on the water knows this.\"\n\nStormwater and sewage improvement\n\nStormwater runoff was also identified in the 1999 grand jury report, because unlike industrial waste, the trash and debris that rain washes off of our yards and streets receives no treatment.\n\nIn 2000, the city of Pensacola adopted a stormwater management program, and in 2001 adopted a stormwater utility to fund infrastructure improvements.\n\nOver the past five years, the city has spent almost $8.7 million in budgeted capital improvements throughout the city. Additionally, the city has invested about $14 million in state and federal grant funds on projects such as Bill Gregory Stormwater Park and Corinne Jones Park. Another $10.4 million in grants have gone to emergency repair projects.\n\nOn Escambia County's end of things, the Natural Resources Department has received an average of about $1 million a year in grant funding annually over the past decade.\n\nThe funding has allowed the department to do some innovative and experimental projects. The Central Office Complex at 3363 West Park Place is a point of pride for the staff, and features a green roof covered in plants, a pervious pavement parking lot designed to \"drink\" rainwater and a nationally certified in-house laboratory.\n\nThe grant funding is coupled with about $125.4 million in BP oil spill funding that's already been earmarked for the county through RESTORE, Natural Resources Damage Assessment and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grants.\n\nThe county has spent about $179.8 million in Local Option Sales Taxes on drainage and dirt road projects, including a major initiative with the ECUA to install stormwater ponds, paved roads and other improvements in the Beach Haven community.\n\nSo far, $82.9 million in Natural Resources Damage Assessment funds have been awarded to the county for 17 projects. Most of the projects are quality of life improvements such as $4.4 million for boat ramps at Mahogany Mill, Navy Point and Galvez Landing; $2.7 for artificial reef creation and restoration and $10.8 million for a 3.4-acre park at Innerarity Point.\n\nBrent Wipf, manager of the county's Water Quality and Land Management Division, said that work done over the years to reduce and remove point sources of discharges cleared the way for a lot of the work.\n\nThe 1999 grand jury report noted that, \"In southern Escambia County, ground water contamination is substantial and has resulted in a well construction moratorium, well closures and water filtration. More than one-half of the county's public supply wells have been contaminated with dry cleaning solvents, pesticides or petroleum products.\"\n\nThe Department of Health in Escambia County, the ECUA, the DEP and Escambia County have partnered on an array of programs to remediate the issues.\n\nThe Escambia County DOH administers the Petroleum Restoration Program for seven Northwest Florida counties. The program, funded by a percentage of Florida fuel sales, allows the DOH to remove and clean up abandoned fuel tanks left behind by shuttered gas stations.\n\n\"A lot are on old sites that have been contaminated since '70s, '80s and early '90s,\" said Gregory Berrian, environmental health director of the Escambia County DOH. \"The state realized they didn’t know where all these storage tanks were, so they created a few programs that say pretty much, ‘If you tell us where the tank is and if you’ve had any sort of leak or spill, we’ll cover the cost of cleaning it up.\"\n\nBerrian said in the '90s, there were about 1,400 eligible sites in Escambia County. Now that number is down to around 290.\n\nDOH has also been working with the county and ECUA to help homes on environmentally sensitive lands — shorelines, wetlands and the like — connect to sewer lines and safely abandon their septic tanks.\n\nECUA Executive Director Stephen Sorrell said, \"we’ve been spending in the range of about $30 million a year for various capital improvement projects. About $8 million of that’s going toward the improvements of the sanitary sewer system in order to upgrade some of the older infrastructure.”\n\nThe capital improvement funds have gone toward large-scale conversion projects in Beach Haven, Navy Point and other areas.\n\nECUA Director of Communications and Government Affairs Timothy Haag said that roughly 60% to 70% of the utility's customers are hooked up to sewer.\n\n\"We have prioritized areas that are close to surface waters and areas where the Health Department has indicated there is a health concern,\" Sorrell said. \"We prioritize those areas and try to address them first, and we’ve done a pretty good job of it. The areas where the septic tanks still remain are primarily where we don’t have a wastewater or sewage collection system.”\n\nHe noted that in those areas, ECUA had to lay pipe to connect to its wastewater treatment facilities. The cost can range from around $50 per foot to about $400 a foot in areas like Pensacola Beach.\n\n\"Millions of dollars sounds like a lot of money, but it doesn’t go very far at that rate,\" Sorrell said. \"Our issue is really pretty simple. We don’t have the ability to collect any tax money, and we get very little grant money or anything because we are a special district. About every bit of money we get has to come comes from our ratepayers, then we have to try to reapply these funds to make these improvements without overcharging ratepayers.\"\n\nSorrell said in this issue and most others, \"There's more need than there are dollars to do them.\"\n\nPart 4: Is Escambia County holding air, water polluters accountable?\n\nJessica Baker balanced precariously on the lip of a small bridge, taking a moment to steady herself against the railing.\n\nWith nothing but a sheer two-story drop in front of her, she slowly lowered a flat, black and white disk into the stream beneath her until it disappeared. She called back what she observed to Barbara Albrecht, who jotted it down on her clipboard, then handed Baker the next testing implement.\n\nIt was a balmy Sunday in September, and the two women had volunteered their day to collect samples from urban watersheds throughout Escambia County.\n\nAlbrecht, a marine biologist, has been doing the work for decades as a member of the Florida Bream Fishermen's Association. The citizens' group has been sampling local waters for 50 years, and currently monitors at 48 stations throughout the county.\n\nThat Sunday, the group was doing its \"urban run,\" and Baker had volunteered to help.\n\nHistorically, our local water bodies such as Bayou Chico, Bayou Texar, Carpenter Creek and others have been polluted by contaminants from heavy industry. Today, stormwater is one of the biggest threats. When it washes off roads and yards, it often carries sediment, nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, oil and grease, trash, pesticides and metals that get deposited directly into the water with no filtration.\n\n\"This system at one time supported all kinds of people, all kinds of communities,\" Albrecht said. \"People swam and fished, and you used to be able to take a boat all the way down. We've lost the beauty of nature. Nature's hanging on, we just need to help her a little.\"\n\nA grand jury reviewed Escambia County's environment in 1999, and issued 27 recommendations, many of them dealing with the overarching policies that guide how regulators monitor and regulate industry and the environment.\n\nIt identified stormwater as a major concern. It also recommended that the county step up its monitoring efforts. The report noted that after Champion International, the then-owners of the Cantonment paper mill, settled a pollution lawsuit with property owners, the state dialed back monitoring efforts in the area considerably.\n\nAfterward, \"Northwest District of (DEP) then stopped almost all ambient water quality monitoring in the Perdido System, and elsewhere in the area, even though the mill was visibly and obviously polluting Eleven Mile Creek,\" the grand jury report said. \"Biologists were assigned to other duties, the Pensacola lab was dismantled, and the task of monitoring was given to the Northwest Florida Water Management District.\"\n\nBecause the district was not provided funding to conduct monitoring, the work was left to \"Champion, its paid consultants and to volunteers from the Bream Fishermen's Association.\"\n\nSince then, local government has stepped in to fill the void, but there are still concerns about some of the local monitoring efforts, how much data is available to the public and local environmental policy.\n\nHow has water quality monitoring improved since the grand jury report?\n\nCurrently, there are 14 local waters on the DEP's list of impaired waters, and most of our watershed has high levels of bacteria, nutrients and other problem contaminants.\n\nUnless you've lived here long enough to know the area's history, you likely would have no clue about the sorry state of our water.\n\nThe Department of Health in Escambia County issues water quality advisories on its website, but does not typically post signs or other information at problem sites.\n\nDr. John Lanza, director of the local DOH, said the department only monitors for enterococci — a bacteria that typically isn't dangerous, but that can indicate other harmful contaminants.\n\n\"Enterococci is going to change by the minute,\" Lanza said. \"Depending on which way the wind is blowing the tide, what you sampled a minute ago is going to be different from what you sampled a minute ago. It's going to change again if it rains 10 minutes later. Unless you have continuous sampling, you really can't know what's happening at any particular moment, you just know what's there in the history.\"\n\nThe DOH monitors 13 high-traffic shorelines through the state's \"Healthy Beaches\" program established back in 2000.\n\nEscambia County conducts general water quality monitoring at 48 stations around the county, as well as conducting project-specific monitoring at 14 locations including the Pensacola Bay and Navy Point living shorelines, Bill Gregory Stormwater Park, the Jones Swamp Floodplain expansion and others.\n\nStill, there's no one handy place where the data is posted in a way for citizens to easily understand and make sound health decisions.\n\n\"There's a lot of information,\" said Gregory Berrian, DOH's environmental health director. \"It takes research. It takes someone to want to know about where they live and where they’re playing.\"\n\nA 2016 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study noted there have been more than 450 studies of the Pensacola Bay system in recent history. Many of them exist in hard copy rather than online, making them difficult to compile.\n\nThe study notes there has been \"no long-term, multi-metric, and consistently-conducted monitoring effort to determine water quality trends in all but a few parameters.\" It noted that surface water condition for the system had been ranked in the past as between \"fair\" and \"good,\" but \"all chemical water quality judgments to date are based on an incomplete database and their conclusions are subject to wide interpretation.\"\n\nThe report features a wealth of information on the local sediment, seagrass, sea life and other subjects, but concludes, bottom line, that \"preventing further chemical and biological deterioration is an achievable goal but pragmatically any measurable improvement will occur incrementally over the long-term in the shadow of the increasing effects of climate change.\"\n\nAlbrecht argues there is much that can be done to start making improvements in the here and now, but it's not happening on the necessary scale.\n\nFor instance, in a recent newsletter, the Bream Fishermen's Association said that the new $417 million bridge over Pensacola Bay will create about 30 acres of hardened surface on each of its two spans. The organization calculated a one-inch rain event will generate 814,500 gallons of stormwater per span that will spill directly into Pensacola Bay with no form of treatment.\n\n\"These (water quality) problems are from 20, 30, 50 years ago, but we are still making the exact same mistakes, so they are going to be problems for your children and your grandchildren,\" Albrecht said.\n\nHow has air quality and local policy improved in the last 20 years?\n\nThe 1999 grand jury report said that the area's ozone levels \"are among the highest in the state and have been for many years.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement that in the last two decades since then, the air quality in Escambia County has improved significantly due to reductions in emissions of several key pollutants.\n\n\"In particular, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in Escambia County — the majority of which are from the Crist Electric Generating Plant — have dropped by 98 percent in the last two decades,\" the statement said. \"This drop in emissions is largely due to the installation of the wet scrubber at the Crist plant in late 2009 to help control SO2 emissions.\"\n\nThe state operates two air quality monitors in Escambia County that currently measure ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and SO2.\n\nEscambia County operates 13 air quality monitoring locations, largely focused around landfills and concrete crushing plants.\n\nThe main impetus for the program were concerns of residents who were worried they were being poisoned by gasses and dust from the many waste and recycling facilities that surrounded their neighborhood.\n\n\"Historically, we never did air quality monitoring, but when it became a hot button issue three years ago with the Rolling Hills facility and the hydrogen sulfide, the concrete crushing and the potential for silica dust and fine particulates, the board asked us to start,\" said the county's top scientist, Chips Kirschenfeld, director of the Department of Natural Resources Management. \"That was a whole new field for this department that rose out of the desire from County Commissioners, and we had the knowledge and the background to start.\"\n\nKirschenfeld said he, Tim Day, environmental programs manager, and Brent Wipf, manager of the Water Quality and Land Management Division, were brought on staff in the wake of the grand jury report to help the county start addressing its environmental legacy.\n\nHe added that as recommended by the grand jury, the county had started acquiring sensitive lands for protections. Additionally, the state expanded the Environmental Resource Permitting program — which regulates almost all changes to the landscape that affect surface water flows — to Northwest Florida.\n\n\"To me, one of the first things that came out of this (grand jury report) was the push for local ordinances and rules changes — from protecting wetlands and environmentally sensitive lands, to well head protections, to stormwater improvements, a lot of different regulations went into place,\" Kirschenfeld said. \"And along with that, the county made the decision that they needed professional environmental staff, which they didn’t have at the time.\"\n\nHow has accountability improved in the last 20 years?\n\nThe Northwest District of the DEP declined to be interviewed by the News Journal, but answered general inquires in a written statement.\n\nOne of the key passages of the 1999 grand jury report was that, \"We find that the Northwest District of the Department of Environmental Protection failed to properly implement and enforce the environmental laws, rules and regulations. The district office succumbed to political, economic, and other pressures, allowing regulated business, industries and individuals to pollute the area’s air and water. The district director, and others acting on his behalf, ignored and concealed environmental violations against the sound advice of staff employees.\"\n\nIn a response, the DEP noted that \"DEP leadership at both the district and agency levels have changed since 1999 ... (but) the department’s mission to protect Florida natural resources is ongoing. The department continues to collect, study and analyze data about our changing environment in order to make informed, science-based decisions that ensure our natural resources will be protected for generations to come.\"\n\nNonetheless, an array of local environmentalists have decried the current iteration of the DEP as a \"permitting agency\" that focuses far more on paperwork than field work.\n\nHistorically, dischargers have conducted their own monitoring and collected their own samples, which are sent to the DEP for approval.\n\n\"The polluter has always had to take samples on a regular basis,\" said Linda Young, founder of the Florida Clean Water Network. \"When their effluent is leaving the pipe, they sample it every so often and take measures of the various pollutants. They would do that themselves, but in the old days, DEP would show up unexpected and do samples and check receiving waters' conditions to see what was happening there.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Over the years, it has got weaker and weaker and weaker. (Polluters) they go out and do their own thing, and DEP might spot check, they might not. It’s pretty much a self-regulating, fox-guarding-the-henhouse kind of a thing.\"\n\nWhen dischargers are found in non-compliance with regulations, one would assume DEP would have authority to crack the whip on violators, say \"comply or else\" and resolve noncompliance matters quickly.\n\nIn reality, it is more of a push and pull, where industries can apply for \"site specific alternative criteria\" that loosen regulations and make it easier for them to comply, negotiate over consent orders that dictate the standards they'll be held to and embark on lengthy appeals processes to fight DEP rulings.\n\nWhile local advocates recognize there needs to be due process, they point out that it's everyday citizens and tax payers who suffer during these drawn out administrative battles.\n\n\"People think, 'What are these stupid environmentalists screaming about?' \" Young said. \"It's the water you are drinking. The water you are bathing in. It's fundamental to all of us. It's a huge deal, and it's a travesty. You need to know this, and you have a right to know this, because it's not going to get any better if no one is doing anything to make it better.\"\n\nPart 5: Sweeping reforms were proposed, but few came. What happened?\n\nIt was a \"stick of dynamite,” the judge said.\n\nIn one clear, concise, comprehensive document, a grand jury had researched and cataloged Escambia County's environmental sins and laid them bare for all to review.\n\nIt was a powerful, explosive read. Among other things, the 1999 grand jury report recommended the local head of the Department of Environmental Protection be terminated for ignoring and concealing violations, and proposed that dereliction of duty by a public officer be designated a criminal offense.\n\nStill, the question to John Kuder, then the chief judge of Florida's First Judicial Circuit, was whether the report would blow open the current regime of inaction and enabling, or create a flash fire that quickly burned away into a puff of smoke.\n\nConvening a grand jury to review the factors affecting Escambia County's air and water quality — and regulators' efficacy in protecting it — had been an easy sell when then State Attorney Curtis Golden approached Kuder with the proposal in 1998.\n\n\"I've lived here all of my adult life,\" Kuder said from his downtown Pensacola office some 20 years later. \"I can remember when there were plenty of fish to catch, plenty of scallops, all kinds of wildlife and fauna. So many species I used to enjoy are gone. ... My own personal experience was exactly what I saw here (in the report).\"\n\nAfter Kuder agreed to impanel the grand jury, Assistant State Attorney Russell Edgar set about to gather information and testimony from scores of different biologists, chemists, engineers, businessmen, environmentalists, regulators and records.\n\n“What I did was present this testimony to the grand jury and anyone else who wanted to hear it over a period of about a year,” Edgar said. “During that time, I went to the outfalls of the paper mill and all the plants and walked them. I got a boat and went up the rivers to see the discharges in the bays. I overflew the area in a helicopter and basically studied the maps and the charts and the figures of what had happened and historically reviewed how all this began.”\n\nHe continued, “It became evident that we had wonderful resources here, but the lack of any planning whatsoever caused the degradation of our natural resources, and this resulted in permanent damage and very costly consequences to the local people.”\n\nThe grand jury's final report was damning, offering 27 recommendations for local and state regulators to start reversing the harm to our environment. A finding that particularly enraged the public was an assertion that the Northwest Florida District of the DEP had \"succumbed to political, economic, and other pressures,\" and then-district director, Bobby Cooley, had \"ignored and concealed environmental violations against the sound advice of staff.\"\n\nSome 20 years removed from the report's release, Kuder said, \"The response was immediately favorable. It was favorable because of its scope, its detail and the common sense of its findings and recommendations. It just seemed to make sense based on all of the findings.\"\n\nStill, local and state officials responded to the report with denial and denouncements. Elected officials scoffed at the suggestion they put corporations ahead of citizens, and environmental regulators were adamant they knew best how to safeguard our natural resources.\n\nA defiant DEP administration said it would take the grand jury's recommendations under consideration, but ultimately refused to terminate Cooley and balked at implementing many of the sweeping changes recommended in the report.\n\n\"After the report was issued and presented publicly, there were a group of people, chamber of commerce people and others, who came to the aid of the local director who had served their interest and not the public's,\" Edgar said. \"They criticized the report and took out ads in the paper against it, chastised me for it and so forth. I even had a County Commissioner who accused me of just doing it because I wanted to run for office, which was just laughable.\"\n\nThe then-head of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, David Struhs, told the News Journal at the time, “I would not say the grand jury’s work was an endorsement, but it was a vindication that the work done there is complex,\" adding, \"the people who work there work for me. They don’t work for a citizen’s panel impaneled by a state attorney.”\n\nWithin a few years, Struhs had left the DEP for a job in International Paper's corporate administration.\n\nIn the months after the grand jury report, the News Journal noted that few of the initiatives gained much traction. In recent years, a lot of the progress that's been made on environmental issues is thanks to a windfall of BP oil spill settlement funding.\n\nKuder, speaking of the time after the report, said, “When there were people and organizations that tried to do something ... they could get information. They couldn’t get action. You can do all the studies in the world, but unless you can put that into the hands of people who can transform the community, the result is a book sitting on the shelf. That’s where it started to slowly disintegrate.\"\n\nThus, it now falls to a few to try to fight for what's right in the face of inaction and indifference.\n\n\"A lot of very good people in this community spend all of their spare time trying to get the right thing done and not being able to,\" Kuder said.\n\nExpressing what's perhaps his biggest disappointment, the judge said he didn't feel as if the voting public had followed the recommendation that they become more knowledgeable and involved about the environment concerning environmental issues and demand that their elected officials do the same.\n\n\"If you want things to happen the way you believe they should, exercise your right to vote, know who the candidate you support is working for, what source of revenue is funding that campaign,\" Kuder said. \"You can have someone who says I'm for the environment, and I'm committed to cleaning up air pollution, water pollution, ground water pollution. But you better know who that man or woman really is, and you certainly should know from whom their support is generated.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/17"}]}

Over the past few quarters, Burger King has been playing catch up, and now the company is hoping a major investment in restaurants and advertising will help spark growth and propel it ahead of its peers.\n\nIn the next two years, Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), is planning to invest $400 million in improving the brand — $250 million will go toward updating restaurant tech, kitchens and remodeling, and $150 million to advertising and digital products. Franchisees will also invest in improving the brand.\n\nOne key part of that plan? Reminding customers of what Burger King is all about: The Whopper.\n\n“What we really want to do in the short term is reintroduce America’s love affair with the Whopper,” Tom Curtis, President of Burger King North America, told CNN Business. The plan is to make sure workers are well trained in making the best possible Whopper, and that kitchens support consistency and ease of preparation.\n\nConsider the Whopper Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe fast food giant is also going to lean in to advertising its signature burger.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve talked about it enough. I just don’t think we’ve celebrated it enough,” Curtis said. “And I’m looking forward to putting it back in its rightful place as our lead act.” Through advertising, Burger King wants to remind customers that the Whopper is flame-grilled and customizable. But some other tweaks could be in store as well, Curtis said.\n\nThe brand is “evaluating whether or not there are changes to the Whopper that could make it a better product,” he said. But the team also doesn’t want to risk messing with its best known offering. “[We’re] a little bit in the camp of if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” Curtis said.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nDuring the pandemic, restaurants had to quickly adjust their business models to contend with disrupted supply chains, closed dining rooms and a spike in demand for delivery. Burger King didn’t adapt very well.\n\n“Over the last few years during the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic … [Burger King US] didn’t do a great job of adjusting our business to the environment, ” RBI CEO Jose Cil told CNN Business. “We didn’t simplify.”\n\nIn the pandemic, many restaurants quickly slimmed down menus in order to simplify kitchen operations when delivery orders suddenly went through the roof. Workers scrambling to fill online orders could at least avoid complicated preparations.\n\nBut Burger King did the opposite.\n\n“We, in fact, complicated things,” Cil said, “we added menu items … that were more difficult and not necessarily intuitive and typical for us to serve.”\n\nSpecifically Cil is talking about the Ch’King, a hand-breaded chicken sandwich that the chain introduced last year. The product “created a ton of bottlenecks operationally,” Cil said.\n\nThe issues set Burger King back as competitors advanced. In the second quarter of this year, sales at Burger King US restaurants open at least 13 months grew by just .4%. Sales at McDonald’s (MCD) US restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 3.7% in that period.\n\nBurger King recently retired the Ch’King, replacing it with the Royal Crispy Chicken sandwich.\n\nThe Ch’King “was a great product that was difficult or challenging for teams to execute on,” Curtis said. “The best thing for the guest is great flavor and consistency. So our Royal Crispy Chicken, which we just launched, offers both.”\n\nAs Burger King continues to work on other menu innovations, it will have to balance ease of execution with items that excite customers, Curtis added.\n\nRemodels and rewards upgrades\n\nThe chain is planning to remodel hundreds of restaurants. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/File\n\nTo help boost sales and restaurant traffic, Burger King is making other improvements, including making restaurants look more modern.\n\nThe chain plans to remodel about 800 restaurants over the next two years.\n\nThe idea is to have consistent branding, but with customized layouts that make sense for the environment, Curtis said. A Burger King in a city might be smaller, with a higher focus on digital ordering. In a rural town, it might have more seating.\n\nBurger King has already started updating its image. The brand changed its logo last year, switched packaging, uniforms and signage to the new look. A few years ago, it shared what remodeled restaurants might look like: triple-lane drive-thrus, burger pickup lockers and takeout counters.\n\nThe company also wants to make make it easier for customers to use the chain’s mobile app, revamp its rewards program by offering customized digital deals, and make delivery and to-go orders more convenient.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/greatamericanbites/2014/10/24/whataburger-hamburger-patty-melt/17784405/", "title": "Regional fast food: Why Whataburger is worth a stop", "text": "Larry Olmsted\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThe scene: Back in 1950, before Ray Kroc started franchising McDonald's, before Fatburger or Burger King, when the only notable fast food burger chains were White Castle, Krystal and In-n-Out, Whataburger came on the scene. Like Jim 'N Nick's, Zaxby's and other successful chains profiled in this column, it started by serving cheap eats to college students, in this case 25-cent burgers across the street from Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Texas. Sixty-four years later, there are more than 700 locations spanning a dozen states in an unbroken line from Arizona to Florida. The company remains family-owned and run by the son of the founder, with only about a fifth of the locations franchised (not to be confused with What-A-Burger, another old, smaller regional chain in the Carolinas).\n\nWhataburger is easily recognized by its \"Flying W\" logo and distinctive architecture, a white and orange A-frame. While the very first restaurant was an urban stand, the distinctive standalone Whataburgers began early on in Odessa, Texas, and often included drive up car hop service. Today the A–frame roof is usually incorporated into a more modern and standard building, and inside most look just like any other roadside fast-food place, with easily cleaned tile floors, synthetic tables and chairs, and a counter with menu boards over it (though one location I visited in central Alabama was playing Christian radio as background music, something you are not likely to find at Burger King). Even the newer locations are still easily recognized by the high peaked roof and color scheme, and unlike most competitors, many Whataburger stores are open 24 hours.\n\nReason to visit: Patty melt, signature double burgers, onion rings, breakfast biscuits\n\nThe food: While the burgers at contemporaries White Castle, Krystal and McDonald's range from very small to small, Whataburger has always positioned itself as the big fast-food burger, requiring two hands. The patties are considerably larger than the competition and served on a generous 5-inch diameter bun. Unlike most chains, they are also cooked to order and delivered to your table, so you are given a little plastic number, in turn white and orange and shaped like the restaurant's signature A-frame roofline.\n\nWhile the burger is a wider two-hand model, the patty is still thin, just as thin as McDonald's or similar versions, but because it is made fresh, it tastes better than most fast-food burgers. It's not quite as hearty and succulent as the Five Guys or Shake Shack models, but definitely a cut above the big three burger chains, McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's. Whataburger also offers a patty melt, which is my favorite sandwich, and because it comes standard as a double with two patties, it is meatier and more substantial. It also comes with grilled onions, Monterey Jack cheese and a uniquely distinctive creamy pepper sauce that is a nice change from all the Thousand Island dressing iterations of \"Secret Sauce\" in the chain burger world. The regular single patty Whataburger is also available as either a double or triple, and without encouraging gluttony, the extra patty does make a difference and really improves the burger experience. On the other hand, in a world where restaurants have increasingly super-sized everything, Whataburger still offers its fries, onion rings, shakes and malts in a more reasonable range of sizes like small, medium and large.\n\nThe fries are virtually indistinguishable from those at McDonald's, which many people love, so if that is your style you will be very happy with these. But in terms of sides, it is the onion rings that stand out, as these are very good, crispy, tasty and solid enough so they don't fall apart when you take a bite. In my opinion, not enough fast-food restaurants offer rings, and when they do they are not usually this good.\n\nWhataburger has a number of interesting signature burgers – all doubles – including an A1 Steak Sauce burger that is a long-time partnership, and some others that that are only regionally available, like the Chop House, with bacon, cheese and house (not A1) steak sauce (Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Florida only) or the Green Chile Cheeseburger – something almost no fast-food places offer (Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico only). These, along with the cooking to order and wider size, really set the chain apart, as do the other menu items with Southern and Southwestern influences like a jalapeno burger, a burger generously topped with grilled peppers, and a slate of breakfast biscuit sandwiches. These are better than the bland English muffins the big chains use and normally only available at places like Chick-fil-A, Popeyes or Bojangles', another notable differentiator. Finally, the shakes, quite thick, are a little bit more real-tasting, or at least less synthetic, than the national chain versions, and while you won't mistake them for ice cream parlor shakes, they are a cut above the industry standard.\n\nIf you are driving and want a fast-food burger, Whataburger is a better choice than the biggest national chains, with some more interesting offerings, especially at breakfast and late night, when it is one of the only places open.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No.\n\nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: Whataburger spans the southern states from Florida to Texas and Oklahoma, and continues up into the Southwest, New Mexico and Arizona; whataburger.com\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

By embracing fresh beef for its Quarter Pounders, McDonald's seeks to head off Wendy's, a traditional rival, which likes to emphasize its usage of the fresh, not frozen, beef. It's also edging closer to the so-called better-burger chains, like Five Guys and Smashburger.\n\nThe changeover from frozen beef in the Quarter Pounder will begin next year in a majority of the U.S. restaurants at the nation's largest fast-food chain.\n\n\"Consumers are demanding more in terms of health and wellness,\" said Jack Russo, an analyst with brokerage Edward Jones. \"They want to know what’s in their products.\"\n\nWhere's the unfrozen beef? At these burger chains\n\nOther McDonald’s sandwiches, which include the Big Mac and the McDouble, could eventually be made without using frozen beef as well. Having boosted foot traffic with the all-day breakfast and recently promoting different sizes of Big Macs, executives say they are only starting on their mission to improve food taste.\n\n\"By no means are we done. This is a first step,\" said McDonald’s USA president Chris Kempczinski.\n\nThe Quarter Pounder was the first burger line chosen for the switch, because it \"is right up there with the Big Mac as we think of iconic products,\" he said. “It's where we have most demanding customers.\" The lineup includes Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe and Signature Crafted Recipe burgers.\n\nFresh beef had been tested in 325 restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 77 restaurants in Tulsa, Okla. McDonald's doesn't break out its sales by individual menu items, but during the test run, the new Quarter Pounder burgers had a double-digit sales increase, according to McDonald's spokeswoman Becca Hary.\n\nKempczinski declined to talk about how long the switch to fresh might take for other McDonald's burgers.\n\nAnd while nutrition will remain the same, he said, burgers with fresh beef will taste better.\n\n\"When you're cooking a fresh patty on the grill, you need to cook it less,\" he said. \"Faster cook time on the grill means you have better flavor retention and it comes right off the grill and is delivered to the customer.\"\n\nThe change in food handling practices and the shorter grill time mean McDonald's must tweak its how-to manuals for staffers. The charge requires the fast-food giant to update its food safety procedures, such as the proper way to store the patties.\n\nMcDonald's switched to frozen in 1973, because it was a way for the chain, expanding rapidly nationwide, to keep up with consumer demand, Hary explained.\n\nAnalyst Russo says the change to fresh beef is in keeping with other improvements from McDonald's, like pledging to have eggs from chickens that aren't confined to cages by 2025 and eliminating artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets. \"I think this will resonate well with people,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald's investors reacted positively. The chain's shares closed at $129.32 up 48 cents or 0.37%.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said retaining existing customers, luring back those who left and turning casual consumers into committed ones will lead to a boost in annual growth of 3% to 5% starting in 2019.\n\nRestaurants in Alaska and Hawaii aren't making the switch, because of the distance and the logistics involved in shipping there, according to Hary.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/greatamericanbites/2017/04/20/hopdoddy-burger-bar/100574718/", "title": "Hopdoddy Burger Bar worth a stop in these western states", "text": "Larry Olmsted\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThe scene: Hopdoddy Burger Bar occupies a fast-casual niche that’s clearly a step above regular fast food burger chains, but not quite your neighborhood pub, with waitstaff service and a full bar in a sleek space of glass, blonde wood, black leather, and the signature neon lime green trim used in the logo and on seat backs. Many locations feature outdoor seating and most have inviting, expansive glass front walls. Seats and high-top bar-style tables have metal tubular frames. There are also regular tables and cozy booths, high ceilings and a central bar with overhead racks, that give the entire place a distinctly three-dimensional vibe that seems lively and buzzy. Yet while it has many elements of a full-service eatery, Hopdoddy can’t quite shake the “fast” feel, and there’s an odd dichotomy between food delivered on metal trays, fries served in rolled paper, and rolls of paper towels on tables like a barbecue joint, and more sophisticated touches such as hefty steakhouse-style knives, and salt and pepper grinders at every table.\n\nA blackboard wall displays instructions and craft beer selections, along with the basic messages that set Hopdoddy apart from most rivals — signs noting that the beef is ground fresh daily from humanely raised cattle that are never given antibiotics or growth hormones, that all fries are hand cut daily in house from Kennebec potatoes, and that all buns are also baked daily at each location. Because of the focus on fresh, quality ingredients, boxes of tomatoes and potatoes are used as decorations. Hopdoddy began with a single flagship store on South Congress Avenue, Austin, Texas' hipster epicenter, and it is to other fast casual burger chains what Whole Foods — also born in Austin — is to regular supermarkets, a hipper and more quality-driven approach to the model.\n\nReason to visit: Burgers, fries with green chili queso, milkshakes\n\nThe food: Rachael Ray’s magazine, Rachael Ray Every Day, named Hopdoddy to its list of Best Burgers in America. So did readers of Food & Wine magazine. What’s the fuss?\n\nHopdoddy’s success starts with its ingredients and sourcing, way above par for this type of restaurant chain, and it goes far beyond the naturally raised, drug-free beef. “We have relationships with our ranchers, right here in Texas and Colorado,\" says corporate executive chef Mark Adair, who is based in Austin, Texas. \"And we grind all our proteins at each location daily: lamb, turkey and bison, as well as beef, and we make our patties rather than taking them out of a box, and that makes a huge difference.” The meat is better and so are the buns, a sometimes overlooked but indispensable part of the burger experience. Here they are brioche-style with an egg wash that gives them a shiny finish, baked daily, with multi-grain and gluten-free options available.\n\nFast food worth a stop: America's best regional chains\n\nUltimately it is the array of offerings and unique topping combinations that really set Hopdoddy apart from its rivals, even if you don’t care about natural beef. There are not many burger places where you can opt for a slab of ahi tuna instead of a ground beef patty, or choose between turkey, chicken and bison burgers. If you want to go meat-free altogether, there’s a black bean and corn patty. You can even upgrade form the regular Angus to Akaushi beef, a wagyu-influenced hybrid with some Japanese cattle genetics ranched in Texas. One of the bestsellers is the Greek burger built around a lamb patty, and there are numerous such signature combinations.\n\n“The Classic is our number one seller,\" says Adair. \"It’s like vanilla ice cream, but a lot of people really like the Primetime, it is very rich. My favorite is the Llano Poblano.” The Classic is a beef patty with red leaf lettuce, tomato, onion and “sassy sauce,” and is about as basic as it gets here. The Primetime subs the Akaushi beef, upgrades the red leaf lettuce to arugula, and adds bleu cheese, caramelized onions and steak sauce. The Llano Poblano, named for both a Texas town and a hot pepper, is beef with Applewood smoked bacon, pepperjack cheese, seared poblano peppers, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion. It has a nice heat without being too hot, and is a really good combination of flavors and smokiness. If you want it more spicy, there’s the El Diablo with both habanero and serrano chilis. All the combinations are well thought out, and I really enjoyed the Greek: ground lamb with feta cheese and tzatziki sauce, and the Buffalo Bill: sort of a clever cross between the basic bison burger, which I am a big fan of, and Buffalo-style hot wings. It tops the patty with bacon, a mix of spicier jack cheese and bleu, the traditional wing accompaniment, and a generous dose of Frank’s Hot Sauce, the classic wing dressing in Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nThe burgers are really good, thanks to great meat, great buns and great flavor combos. Even the little details are taken very seriously, such as varying the type of lettuce or using raw onions, caramelized onions or pickled red onions as appropriate. Odd toppings used in different sandwiches range from ginger to avocado to cilantro pesto, and even Fritos corn chips.\n\nBurgers and fries are America’s favorite classic food combo, and the fries here live up to the burgers. The Kennebec is a variety of potato many chefs think is ideal for frying, because it's lighter and drier with less starch, and the result is crunchy on the outside, with a soft and almost mashed potato-like interior that doesn’t get limp even when cold. They are good on their own but even better served with the signature green chili queso, a cheese dip made in-house daily and served in a bowl on the side. It is rich, cheesy, but not thick or gloppy, and just a tiny bit spicy — enough to liven things up, an excellent and addictive take on queso.\n\nWhile Hopdoddy has burgers to meet just about every taste, including meatless, it also offers a handful of entrée salads, and along with fries, that’s about it — except for the shakes. Another signature part of the menu, these are very good, thick, rich and creamy, and like the burgers, feature well chosen combos. I liked the caramel sea salt, a perfect pairing, but other popular options are a red velvet cake shake, Oreo cookie, and the number one seller, Nutella with chocolate covered pretzels.\n\nWhat regulars say: “I come here because I love the burgers and its one of the few burger places my wife will go to because she can have turkey or tuna,” says Brandon Tucker, editorial director for the Golf Channel’s websites and an Austin resident.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but if you love burgers, it’s about as well as you can do in a chain.\n\nRating: Yum-Plus!

Cook Out is a more fun and personalized take on the most traditional sector of the fast-food genre, with a focus on burgers, shakes and drive-through with the same kind of cheap prices associated with big national burger chains, though you get even more bang for your buck and some personalized charm.\n\nEach Cook Out location is somewhat different, like the myriad architectural variations now used by bigger chains, while still having a recognizable sameness. Newer exteriors are a mix of brick and stone, and they even have a model that looks like a '50s diner in gleaming stainless steel. You order at the counter and then wait to have your name or number called, and many locations have a self-service soft drink area. The big differentiator looks-wise is the log cabin or rustic interior motif with hewn wood log walls or stone walls and a mix of rustic log adorned wooden picnic or campground-style tables mixed in with the synthetic ones. Locally specific décor touches are used to create an individual sense of place, so the Nashville city center Cook Out has its walls adorned with Vanderbilt sports jerseys and country music vinyl. But it’s the extra personal touch and feeling of Southern hospitality that is Cook Out’s secret ingredient – as soon as the person at the register asks, “What do you want on your burger?” the experience is different than going into Burger King or Wendy’s.\n\nReason to visit: Make-your-own combinations, fries, shakes\n\nThe food: Cook Out has a broader menu than its mainstream national peers, but the specialty is create-your-own combo platters with choice of sandwiches (burgers, a pair of hot dogs, grilled chicken, pulled pork barbecue, etc.) and two sides from a lengthy list. The burger is your basic fast-food model, a thin patty almost identical in look and taste to the ones you get at McDonalds or In-N-Out, but it is upgraded by a firmer and slightly more “homestyle” roll and is cooked and topped to order. This theme permeates the menu at Cook Out – it is inexpensive fast food, and there is nothing swoon-worthy here (except maybe the shakes), but the basics are done better than you would think, and if I wanted a cheap drive-through meal, I’d take this over the Big Three national chains every time. The very first Cook Out opened in 1989 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and 10 years later when there were 10 locations, they built the centralized Cook Out Meat Commissary. Today there are more than 200 restaurants and all the burger meat is ground and formed into patties daily, then trucked every single day to each individual store location, never using any frozen meat.\n\nThe chopped barbecue sandwich is stuffed with tender, braised-style pork that feels like it’s bathed in broth (tomato-based barbecue sauce is absent in the North Carolina whole-hog tradition). A very generous portion for likely the least you will ever pay for a pulled pork sandwich (under five bucks with two sides), it’s pretty good, and satisfies the urgent pulled pork craving, but won’t put traditional slow-smoked barbecue joints out of business anytime soon. The hot dog is average, a thinner frank without a lot of flavor, but it comes fully topped and cooked to order and costs less than a buck, and considering most competitors don’t even have hot dogs, it’s a win for frank fans. The weakest section of the main menu is the chicken sandwiches, with dry, bland white meat. They come in four iterations, and I liked the Cajun best simply because the heavy hand of dry seasoning and wet Texas Pete hot sauce made up for the flavor lacking in the chicken itself.\n\nThe sides are more interesting than the mains, with options you won’t see many other places, such as a corn dog, which is appreciably better than the regular hot dog, thanks to a sweet crust with pronounced corn flavor. To me a corn dog is more of a main dish than a side, but this effectively lets big eaters double down on entrees for the same price when they make their combos. Other main dishes masquerading as sides at Cook Out include a chicken wrap, bacon wrap, chicken nuggets and a quesadilla. The opportunity for gluttony is almost absurd, but two people could also split one combo, like a Big Double burger, corn dog and chicken quesadilla – all for under five bucks. The fries, not surprisingly, are the most popular side choice, and they are very good, fresh, hot crispy and better-tasting than they look. They are easily superior to the fast-food fries at the big national competitors, though they are pretty salty. The onion rings are not as good as the standout fries, just average, but again, like hot dogs, most other drive-through spots don’t even have onion rings, so if they are your side of choice, you are in luck. The hush puppies are an interesting and classically Southern option, but relatively flavorless and dense, the best choice only if you are carbo-loading.\n\nIn terms of relative quality, the best thing on the entire menu is the signature shakes, which are featured front and center with around 40 flavors including rotating seasonal specialties such as fresh watermelon or eggnog. Unlike many cheap fast-food shakes, they taste like they are made from actual ice cream. But they are very thick, almost like Midwestern concretes, and virtually impossible to drink through a straw. I took one home and waited more than 20 minutes and still couldn’t get any through the straw. But it’s worth the effort of using a spoon, and flavors run from basic (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate) to branded (M&M, Heath Bar, Oreo) to intriguing combinations (peanut butter banana, banana pineapple). There are also several distinctly Southern flavors including banana pudding and peach cobbler.\n\nFor the price it’s hard to beat Cook Out in the fast-food roadside sector, and the sense of place and friendliness are great added benefits. My biggest complaint is the outdated and excessive packaging – they are mad for the clam-shell foam containers long abandoned by just about every competitor for environmental reasons, and even a single hot dog gets the full foam treatment. Besides waste, packaging hurts the food - they also wrap the sandwiches in foil before putting them in foam, so if you take them to go they sort of steam, making the roll soggy before you get to where you are going, and as a result, the food tastes better in the restaurant. This is especially true with the already very moist pulled pork sandwich - drive 10 minutes in this packaging and it will be dissolved to the point where it is impossible to pick up and eat, and the sogginess even overwhelms the crunch of the cole slaw topping.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but great shakes at a fun, welcoming and bargain-priced roadside option with some unique food offerings..\n\nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: 200+ locations in 10 southeastern states: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia; cookout.com\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

Mills\n\nThe Loop Pizza Grill is heading to the St. Johns Town Center for a makeover.\n\nThat's where the 31-year-old Jacksonville-based chain known for its signature pizzas, salads and burgers, plans to open a new prototype restaurant this fall.\n\nThe 4,000-square-foot, 150-seat restaurant is planned for the vacant spot next to Total Wine & More at 4413 Town Center Parkway, located at the northern edge of the St. Johns Town Center. Build-out of the restaurant is slated to begin this month, said Loop co-founder Mike Schneider. And demolition work could begin as early as this week, he said.\n\nThe prototype represents a new look for The Loop; but the restaurant's fast-casual concept, including its menu, will remain largely unchanged.\n\nAfter all, the fast-casual concept is the fastest-growing restaurant segment. In 2010, the number of fast-casual restaurants grew at a rate of 3.9 percent; during the same period, however, the number of full-service restaurants declined 1.4 percent, according to Technomic.\n\nBased on 2010 sales numbers, the five fastest-growing fast-casual restaurants included Panera, Chipotle, Panda Express, Zaxby's and Five Guys Burgers and Fries.\n\nOf those five, Panera was the first to enter the Jacksonville market in the mid-1990s, about 15 years after The Loop opened its first restaurant in San Marco in 1981.\n\nThe Loop prototype's interior will feature a design concept by Loop co-founder and designer Terry Schneider and Rebecca Davisson of Designmind, the Jacksonville-based interior design firm founded by Davisson and Larry Wilson. According to the company's website, Designmind's credits include restaurants Caffe Andiamo and Restaurant Medure, both in Ponte Vedra Beach, Matthew's Restaurant in San Marco, and others.\n\nAmong the restaurant's signature design elements will be a 50-foot-long mural by Jacksonville artist Steve Williams. In addition to the mural, Williams will contribute other artwork as well, he said.\n\nWith some of the design details still in the final stages of planning, one thing is certain: The restaurant will have outdoor seating for 20-30 guests.\n\nPlans for the prototype date back to 2005 when Mike Schneider, Terry Schneider and their team worked with consultants to create a strategic development plan to reintroduce The Loop, beginning with a fresh look as the chain was set to mark its 25th year in business, Mike Schneider said.\n\n\"The plan was to roll out the new look in 2006-2007,\" he said.\n\nBy 2006, however, the recession was taking hold, and restaurants began to suffer. That included San Marco's Bistro Aix, in which both Schneiders are part owners. Two years later, the recession hit The Loop, he said.\n\nPlans for the prototype were shelved as The Loop worked to make changes to its menu, staffing and other operations in order to weather the economic storm.\n\nAs The Loop was preparing to update its five corporate-owned stores - \"We need a facelift,\" Schneider said - the St. Johns Town Center space became available with the closing of Karl's and the relocation of Villa Vita.\n\n\"We saw the two spaces available\" and began negotiations with the building's owner, a process that stretched into March, he said.\n\nSchneider is hopeful that the new restaurant will open by late October.\n\nBut Loop customers in San Marco, Avondale, Baymeadows, Mandarin, and Orange Park should get a (visual) taste of the new prototype as some of its design elements make their way to those restaurants in the coming weeks and months.\n\nAfter seven years, \"everyone is past ready to start,\" Schneider said.\n\nSushi Cafe shifts its location\n\nSushi Cafe has a new home.\n\nThe popular Riverside sushi spot is now open at 2025 Riverside Ave., #201, just three doors down from its longtime home (#204) near Starbucks at the corner of Margaret Street and Riverside Avenue.\n\nThough smaller, Sushi Cafe's new home - located in the renovated former Quiznos Subs spot - offers more seating than expected.\n\nThe restaurant's contemporary interior offers a mix of booths, high-top tables and counter seating that can accommodate as many as 30 or more diners. And with the addition of a large awning on the building's west side, the restaurant's covered patio can seat up to an additional 50 or more at nearly a dozen tables.\n\nSushi Cafe's move makes way for construction to begin on a new 1,645-square-foot, 90-seat Tijuana Flats restaurant, announced in March. The first building permit for the restaurant was issued June 20.\n\nNewest First Watch restaurant moving in\n\nThe busy intersection of Beach and Hodges boulevards is home to Jacksonville's newest First Watch restaurant.\n\nThe breakfast, brunch and lunch restaurant opened Monday at 13470 Beach Blvd., near Panda Express at the Hodges Pointe Plaza anchored by Walmart. It's the third of a planned four to six Jacksonville-area restaurants by Bradenton-based First Watch.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a newly-constructed building that will also be home to Jacksonville-based Firehouse Subs' 29th company-owned store. That restaurant is scheduled to open in September.\n\nFirst Watch's first area restaurant opened nearly a year ago in Jacksonville Beach at 544 Marsh Landing Parkway; a second followed in September 2011 in Mandarin at 11111 San Jose Blvd.\n\nThe restaurant offers a mix of breakfast and lunch favorites, including omelets, pancakes, crepes, waffles, salads, sandwiches and more.\n\nIn addition to Panda Express, the new restaurant joins Shane's Rib Shack, Miller's Jacksonville Ale House, Bob Evans, Brucci's Pizza and others in the large retail center.\n\nFirst Watch is open from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. daily.\n\ngary.mills@jacksonville.com\n\n(904) 359-4422\n\ntwitter.com/garytmills\n\nfacebook.com/jaxdiningnews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/05/24/brevard-zoo-cafes-get-upgrades-new-looks-and-new-menus/1221766001/", "title": "Brevard Zoo cafes get upgrades with new looks and new menus", "text": "Finding burgers and chicken tenders on the menu at the Brevard Zoo?

The Denver-based company took over food service operations at the zoo earlier this month. SSA has partnerships with zoos and museums across the country, running restaurants and cafes in places including the Denver Zoo, Zoo Miami and the St. Louis Science Center.\n\nWhile the zoo has done a good job of handling food service in-house, the time had come to elevate the main cafe and the pizza shop near the Paws On splash pool, said Frank Fieseler, zoo chief financial officer. It became a question of raising money for conservation and animal projects or to upgrade the cafe.\n\nIt takes about 18 people to run the food services, and SSI general manager Thomas Yeatman said they kept many of the people already on the zoo's food team.\n\nAs part of its partnership with the Brevard Zoo, already has begun updating and refreshing the former Flamingo Cafe.\n\nThere's a new facade with potted plants and rustic wood. Guests are given a buzzer to alert them when their food is ready. The Dippin' Dots and Icee kiosks are getting face lifts, too, plus there will be adults-only alcoholic Icees, Yeatman said.\n\nAnd then there's the menu.

Originally named Der Wienerschnitzel, the chain was known for its recognizable signature A-frame, pup tent-style buildings with mustard-yellow roofs, a handful of which still exist in Southern California. Today the company has grown to well over 300 locations in mostly more modern, boxy and generic fast food edifices. The brand spans ten states and oddly, Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific. The chain has big presence across the Southwest but also sporadically in the Midwest, South and Pacific Northwest.\n\nFamily-owned Wienerschnitzel sells 120 million hot dogs annually, at bargain prices that are very low even by fast food standards, and brings a touch of hominess to the otherwise cookie cutter model with the vintage photos and \"hot dog\" colors used in its restaurants. The tables are still synthetic and the outlets designed for easy cleaning like McDonalds or Burger King, but the eye-catching yellow and red bench cushions playfully evoke the thing most guests come to eat, a dressed frank.\n\nReason to visit: Pretzel rolls, Junkyard Dog, Mini corn dogs.\n\nThe food: Compared to the big national fast food chains, there is a sense of a throwback to a more innocent time at Wienerschnitzel, a subtle Happy Days undercurrent. This ambiance, the cheap prices, and the many offbeat takes on the ways in which hot dogs can be dressed up are the main appeals. I wish the taste of the food was the reason to visit, because Wienerschnitzel is otherwise so likeable, but unfortunately it's just so-so. And it will be disappointing to those unfamiliar with the chain to learn that despite the name, they don't actually serve any kind of wienerschnitzel, the fried breaded meat cutlets popularized in Austria.\n\nHot dogs are the backbone of the menu, and every version is offered with a choice of the original pork and beef blend or a 100% beef version. The difference is not as dramatic as you might expect, but to me the beef is clearly the better option, not just a bit more flavorful, but also because it is thicker, meatier and tastes and feels more like a hot dog should. To further complicate things, each model is also available in a choice of three buns, regular, sesame seeded and pretzel, and given the white bread blandness of the first two, the pretzel roll is the single most standout item at Wienerschnitzel, the way I would go with any dog.\n\nOnce you pick your frank and roll, there are some eight to ten (by location) radically different hot dog choices, not counting the corn dog on a stick. The simple end of the spectrum includes the one-topping options: mustard dog, kraut dog or relish dog. The signatures are far more complex: chili cheese, Chicago (tomato slices, chopped onions, pickle spear, green relish, sport peppers, mustard and celery salt), Bacon Strip Street Dog (bacon, mayo, ketchup, mustard, grilled onions) and finally, the aptly named Junkyard Dog, with American cheese, mustard and grilled onions all topped with a heap of French fries and chili. (Visit a location in Utah, where pastrami-topped burgers are the state's favorite snack, and Wienerschnitzel gets on the bandwagon with a pastrami dog that is one of the tastier choices). Besides its sheer novelty, the Junkyard Dog tastes better than most of its peers because the crispy fries play the role of fried onion strings, adding a nice crunch factor to the otherwise sloppy, tender dog and roll. In general, since the dogs themselves are fairly bland, the best bet is to load up as many of the toppings you like as possible.\n\nThe menu also includes burgers topped in similar fashion, from chili to Junkyard, but the patty is pretty nebulous, though the toasted, slightly crisp roll gives it a small step up from its basic fast food siblings. There are regular skinny and curly fries, both with a nice crunchy texture, but the curly ones are not seasoned like they usually are elsewhere, and like many things on the menu, could use more flavor. Fries are also served topped with chili and cheese, and again, the rule here seems to be the more stuff on top, the better. The one notable and unusual offering is a bag of bite-sized mini corn dogs, not good per se so much as a welcome alternative to other fried apps like chicken nuggets or jalapeno poppers, and in their own way, strangely addictive, with a pronounced corn flavor in the shell.\n\nThe final part of Wienerschnitzel's unique equation is Tastee Freez, the chain's proprietary soft serve ice cream, and as a result it has a far bigger dessert menu than fast food burger places. Choices include cones, dipped cones, sundaes, banana splits, root beer floats and shakes. But again, the ice cream itself is unexceptional and the shakes taste no better than those at the national burger giants, which is to say, not worth the calories.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but if you want a hot dog, that rules out McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King.\n\nRating: OK (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: More than 300 restaurants with the most in California, and also Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Washington and Guam, wienerschnitzel.com\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

Compared to the 20 locations for food and drink options at the team's previous home, the new stadium will have 42 locations available.\n\nMany will be filled with local flavor. Other key players in the the Crew's culinary lineup will be Hot Chicken Takeover, Barrio Tacos, Crafted Culture Brewing, Gemüt Biergarten, Legacy Smokehouse and Donatos Pizza.\n\n“We’re using food and beverage to enhance the experience. We want the fans to come down to the Arena District and hang out at the new stadium for an hour before the match,\" Taylor said. \"You know, come in ... walk around, familiarize themselves with the stadium, and, you know, just enjoy the ambience of being Downtown.\"\n\nColumbus restaurants:Looking for Columbus area restaurants near you? Here are places to try\n\nWhile fans still can look forward to top-selling stadium favorites such as nachos, hot dogs and soft pretzels, the local options are an example of fans talking and the Crew listening following a 2019 survey about what they would like to see from the new stadium, Taylor said.\n\nHe said the Columbus Crew continued its partnership with Levy Restaurants, working together to provide different food and drink options and making the process of ordering and receiving food quicker and more user-friendly.\n\nCost of attending:Here's what it will cost to bring your family to see the Crew, Clippers, Blue Jackets or Buckeyes\n\nCrew fans looking forward to Columbus food favorites\n\nHomer Olsen, a 30-year-old season ticket holder from the Hilliard area, said he’s particularly looking forward to Hot Chicken Takeover, which used to have a food truck that came out to the old stadium, as well as Dirty Frank’s and Barrio Tacos.\n\n“They all sound definitely really good — definitely an upgrade over the previous food,” Olsen said.\n\nTaylor said the local restaurants featured in the new stadium were chosen carefully, using both fan interest and other factors.\n\n“We hit the streets, you know? We started to ask local partners if there was interest,” he said. “A big push from the ownership and the executive team of the Crew was to try and get minority- and women-business enterprises, so that was also a target approach.”\n\nCrafted Culture Brewing, for example, is the first Black-owned brewery in central Ohio.\n\nBrent Miller, a 24-year-old from the Grandview Heights area, said he’s excited for the return of Hot Chicken Takeover, but added that he'd also like to try Preston’s and appreciates the inclusion of Columbus craft breweries.\n\n“I think it sounds like a really good variety. You can kind of go to multiple games in a season and not repeat yourself and still be getting something decent every single time,” Miller said.\n\nKevin Johnson, a 44-year-old from the Beechwold neighborhood, said he’s happy to see the Crew incorporating local food options, both for home fans and those coming into Columbus.\n\n“I think it’s a small window to show off your city, so when away fans come to see the Crew and all of our local options are there, I think it says a lot about, you know, they want to say the Crew is for Columbus. So, when you offer food that’s specific to Columbus, I think it’s fantastic,” Johnson said.\n\nSchmidt’s, which set up roots in German Village back in 1886 and has been involved with the Crew since Historic Crew Stadium opened in 1999, was one of the top two requested restaurants for the new stadium from the fan survey, along with Hot Chicken Takeover, according to Taylor.\n\nThe restaurant's offerings will include its signature “Bahama Mama” sausage dish; its signature bratwurst; sauerkraut; German potato salad; and its jumbo cream puff for dessert, said Carla Epler, chief operating officer of Schmidt’s.\n\nEpler said that since Schmidt’s is a part of the fabric of central Ohio and deemed an iconic food of Columbus, it makes sense for it to be a part of the options at the new stadium.\n\n“I just think it’s fabulous that they want to do, you know, the taste of the community that they’re in,” Epler said. “You can get an institutional hot dog anywhere, and it all tastes the same. When you have the local doing what they’re known for … having local iconic foods and well-established restaurants is huge for the patrons and for the Crew brand itself.”\n\nTaylor said prices for the food will be increased from the local restaurants' brick-and-mortar locations. Epler said those increased stadium prices, at least for Schmidt’s, will be similar to their fair and festival prices.\n\nFaster service, new ordering options\n\nTaylor said that it's not just the food that will be new and improved at the new stadium. Technology is getting an upgrade, too, and should improve speed of service.\n\nPart of that includes the initiative to go cashless that began last year at the old stadium in response to the pandemic. Other elements include implementing QR code ordering, mobile ordering services, “Order Here, Pay Here” locations and self-ordering kiosks.\n\nDining locations will include both built-in areas and food trucks in various places around the stadium. These include the southeast plaza — which can host from 1,500 to 2,000 fans — the main and upper concourse levels of the facility and some terraces, Taylor said.\n\n“I think the fans, when they come in here, they’re going to be blown away, not only with the team on the pitch and the design of the stadium,” he said. “I think the amount of offerings, the technology and just the overall variety, I think they’re going to be really pleased.”\n\naatuah@dispatch.com\n\n@asiaatuah", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/30"}]}

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts briefly held the title after agreeing to a five-year, $255 million deal last week.\n\n\"You know, for the last few months, there's been a lot of 'he say, she say.' A lot of nail-biting, a lot of head-scratching going on. But for the next five years, it's a lot of flock going on! Let's go, baby. Let's go, man,\" Jackson said in a video shared on the Ravens' Twitter account.\n\n\"Can't wait to get there, can't wait to be there, can't wait to light up M&T for the next five years, man. Let's get it.\"\n\nNFL DRAFT TRACKER:Live updates, what you need to know as first round gets closer\n\nJackson, who serves as his own agent, and the team had been at loggerheads over a contract for some time as he purportedly sought a fully guaranteed deal that superseded the five-year, $230 million contract Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson received last year.\n\nJackson received a non-exclusive $32 million franchise tag this offseason, which was designed to tie him to the team until a longer deal got done – assuming another club didn't pry him loose with an offer the Ravens were unwilling to match. Jackson is not believed to have received an outside offer sheet.\n\nThe Ravens are scheduled to select 22nd overall Thursday in the first round of the 2023 draft. There had been speculation, partially fueled by GM Eric DeCosta himself, that the team might select a replacement for Jackson. Obviously, that will no longer be under consideration for a club that's qualified for the playoffs four times in Jackson's five NFL seasons.\n\nThe final first-rounder selected in 2018, Jackson was a unanimous league MVP the following season, when he threw a career-high 36 TD passes. His 1,206 rushing yards in 2019 are a record among quarterbacks and he's the only one who's ever topped the 1000-yard plateau twice.\n\nThe biggest knock on Jackson, aside from the injuries that have cut his past two seasons short, has been his postseason performance. The Ravens are 1-3 in the playoffs with him as the starter, his QB rating an abysmal 68.3. The top-seeded team in 2019, they were shockingly ousted at home by the wild card Tennessee Titans.\n\nBut there's no doubting the fear he puts into defenses as one of the best regular-season quarterbacks in history, winning 45 of 61 starts to date. However there will be a new learning curve in 2023 as he adapts to new offensive coordinator Todd Monken while learning to integrate newly signed wideout Odell Beckham Jr. into the new-look attack.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/04/17/jalen-hurts-contract-philadelphia-eagles-quarterback-highest-paid-player-nfl/11681571002/", "title": "Jalen Hurts' contract makes Eagles QB highest-paid NFL player ever", "text": "Jalen Hurts is feeling the love in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nHurts and the Philadelphia Eagles have agreed on a five-year, $255 million deal, a person close to the situation told USA TODAY Sports, that makes the quarterback the highest-paid player in NFL history.

The deal includes $179.3 million guaranteed and a no-trade clause.\n\nHurts’ new contract keeps him in Philadelphia through 2028.\n\nThe deal places Hurts ahead of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers for the top spot among all players in average annual salary.\n\nHurts is coming off a season in which he led the Eagles to a 14-1 record and a trip to Super Bowl 57. He compiled career highs in passing yards (3,701), touchdown passes (22) and passer rating (101.5) in his third season and second as a starter. His efforts earned him second-team All-Pro honors, and he finished second in NFL MVP voting.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT:Jalen Carter falls in first round as Bijan Robinson rises\n\nNFL DRAFT RANKINGS:QBs Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud rank high – but not No. 1 overall\n\nHurts became the eighth Black quarterback in NFL history to start in a Super Bowl and joined Patrick Mahomes in the first Super Bowl to feature two Black starting quarterbacks.\n\nEven in the 38-35 Super Bowl 57 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Hurts was exceptional. He produced 374 total yards and four touchdowns, though he did have a costly fumble that was returned for a touchdown.\n\nThe Eagles drafted selected Hurts in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft. He has 7,906 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in his career. On the ground, he's produced 1,898 yards and 26 touchdowns. He 23-11 in his career as a starter.\n\nWhat deal means for quarterback market\n\nHurts isn't the only big-time quarterback from the 2020 draft class eligible for a new contract extension.\n\nCincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow and Los Angeles Chargers QB Justin Herbert, who were selected No. 1 and No. 6, respectively, are in line to cash in. The signal-callers are entering the fourth year of their rookie contracts, with their fifth-year options expected to be exercised if an extension isn't reached by the May 1 deadline. Both the Bengals and the Chargers expressed optimism this offseason that extensions would be completed at some point for the franchise quarterbacks.\n\nBurrow led the Bengals to a Super Bowl 56 appearance, and Herbert has the most passing yards by a quarterback in his first three seasons. Both their contracts will presumably exceed Hurts' once completed.\n\nHurts' contract also could alter the outlook for Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson. The Ravens placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Jackson in March amid a contract stalemate. Hurts' deal could give the Ravens and Jackson a benchmark, with the Eagles QB resetting the market yet not giving their star a fully guaranteed deal like the one Deshaun Watson received last offseason from the Cleveland Browns.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on Twitter @TheTylerDragon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2023/04/17/jalen-hurts-contract-winners-losers-lamar-jackson-patrick-mahomes/11681393002/", "title": "Winners and losers of Jalen Hurts' record contract include Eagles ...", "text": "Jalen Hurts' breakout 2022 season, which ended just shy of a victory in Super Bowl 57, has enabled him to break through the NFL's salary scale.\n\nMonday, the Philadelphia Eagles' Pro Bowl quarterback agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $255 million, its $51 million average the highest in league history – slightly more than Aaron Rodgers' deal (currently $50.3 million per season). Hurts' $179.3 million in guarantees are also among the most ever.\n\nAs with any groundbreaking pact, there will be significant ramifications, both immediate and over the long run. A look at the potential winners and losers from Hurts' payday:\n\nWINNERS\n\nJalen Hurts: Duh, right? But give the 2022 league MVP runner-up – and don't forget, Hurts was the best player on the field in the Super Bowl (304 yards, TD passing; 70 yards, 3 TDs rushing) – copious credit for crafting his market with impeccable timing. There were some questions entering last season as to whether he was the Eagles' long-term answer under center. Hurts answered them unequivocally and, now, the 2020 second-round pick becomes the NFL's best compensated player after just three seasons.\n\nEagles' title window: It's typically difficult to keep Super Bowl-qualifying teams intact. Yet even prior to minting Hurts, Philadelphia executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman had managed to retain many of his team's key free agents. It's also typically difficult for clubs with enrichened quarterbacks to keep quality players around him. But by avoiding the various pitfalls of having to put the franchise tag on Hurts next year – and Roseman has a history of paying his best players sooner rather than later – the NFC champs can now spread his payout through the 2028 season with the knowledge that the salary cap will continue to expand. If Hurts can keep his performance trending up, little reason the Eagles shouldn't as well.\n\nOther QBs drafted in 2020: Philadelphia was motivated to pay Hurts as he entered the final campaign of his rookie contract. The Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow, Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa and Los Angeles Chargers' Justin Herbert were all first-round picks that year – along with the Green Bay Packers' Jordan Love – and fifth-year options can keep all under contractual control through the 2024 season, Tagovailoa's already activated. But with a bar established, negotiations for these young passers – perhaps for Burrow and Herbert, in particular – could get a jolt.\n\nNicole Lynn: It's only been four years since she became the first Black woman to represent an NFL draft pick, and she's just a few months removed from being the first Black woman with a client who was the QB1 in a Super Bowl. Now Lynn, the president of football operations at Klutch Sports, has negotiated the richest deal in league annals, at least for now. Don't be surprised if she's a bigger rock star than Hurts when all is said and done.\n\nMORE:How agent Nicole Lynn, Patriots rookie QB Bailey Zappe forged uncommon NFL partnership\n\nWHO IS NICOLE LYNN? Meet Hurts' history-making agent\n\nPatrick Mahomes: No indication he's itching to rework his own historic arrangement, one that could be worth a half-billion dollars if the Kansas City Chiefs star played out the contract's 10-year duration. Don't expect that to happen as the cap hits climb – including one scheduled for more than $62 million in 2027. Eventually, Mahomes, the guy who beat out Hurts for league and Super Bowl MVP last season, will renegotiate. And, if he plays his cards right, deals like Hurts' will only help push his average annual earnings into the stratosphere. Don't rule out $75 million a year by the time Mahomes re-ups.\n\nLOSERS\n\nNFC East: The Dallas Cowboys' Dak Prescott is scheduled to have a nearly $60 million cap hit in 2024, so Jerry Jones and Co. may have to pay their quarterback anew soon. The Washington Commanders are hoping second-year QB Sam Howell is their guy. But if he's not – and this franchise has mismanaged the position in spectacular fashion in recent years – the price just went up for the next owners to pursue an established veteran to lead what otherwise appears to be a playoff-caliber roster. And the New York Giants recently gave Daniel Jones a four-year, $160 million windfall ... but they could have a different kind of issue if he turns out to be a one-year wonder.\n\nCleveland Browns: That sea-changing, five-year, fully guaranteed, $230 million contract they gave QB Deshaun Watson last year? The one that's already been restructured? Welp, once again appears the Browns could be adrift in deep water given no other franchises have followed their lead ... though Hurts and Lynn did well to get about 70% of his new money in the bank.\n\nNATE DAVIS:For Ravens' Jackson, it's well past time to hire an agent\n\nBaltimore Ravens: Speaking of guaranteed deals ... Hurts' agreement probably doesn't help a franchise trying to bring 2019 MVP Lamar Jackson, who serves as his own agent, back into the fold – especially if Jackson, widely believed to be seeking a (fully guaranteed) bankroll in excess of Watson's, decides it's now time to move the goalposts. The Ravens would surely dive over the goal line drawn by Hurts.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/mike-freeman/2023/04/18/jalen-hurts-record-deal-another-step-beyond-nfls-racist-past/11681721002/", "title": "Jalen Hurts' record deal another step beyond NFL's racist past", "text": "If you want to understand just how remarkable the contract extension signed by Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts truly is, the one that's the richest contract ever, you need to go back in time. You need to look at how Black quarterbacks have been treated. How badly, awfully, disgracefully they've been treated. You need to understand history and that splendid bending of its arc.\n\nWe could start anywhere on the NFL timeline. Quarterback Marlin Briscoe in the 1960s was portrayed as a locker room agitator and released. Quarterback James \"Shack\" Harris was deluged with hate mail throughout his career in the 1970s. Warren Moon is one of the most talented pass throwers ever but spent much of his early career in the CFL, where the racism in football was less structural. In the 1980s, before Doug Williams made Super Bowl history, he faced a career of double standards and racism.\n\nIn 2003, Rush Limbaugh, while an analyst for ESPN, said Pro Bowler Donovan McNabb only received accolades because he was Black.\n\nMore:The story of Doug Williams, celebrated now, was hardly a fairy tale: He faced ugly racism\n\n\"Sorry to say this, I don't think he's been that good from the get-go,\" Limbaugh said. \"I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a Black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team.\"\n\nLimbaugh was fired by ESPN. So we've gone from one Eagles quarterback two decades ago being attacked for being Black to another Eagles quarterback being celebrated for his character.\n\nThere are numerous other examples of how far Black quarterbacks have come that go back a century. In the 1930s, NFL owners quietly banned Black players from joining the NFL for 13 years in what's commonly and ironically called \"the gentlemen's agreement.\" Some 80 years later, Colin Kaepernick was effectively banned from playing in the NFL after leading a player protest movement starting in 2016.\n\nMore:Eagles make QB Jalen Hurts highest-paid player in NFL history with five-year, $255 million contract\n\nIn the recent past, and even now, the mental acuity of Black quarterbacks were commonly described quite differently from their white counterparts. Scouting publications, one 2004 examination found, described Black quarterbacks with great physical attributes and white quarterbacks with mental prowess.\n\nIt was common for Black quarterbacks to be told they should switch positions. Bill Polian, who is in the Hall of Fame and built multiple teams, said before the 2018 draft that Lamar Jackson should play wide receiver instead of quarterback. That was just five years ago.\n\nThese are just small pieces of the history, and even this little bit of data puts into context this remarkable moment for Hurts.\n\nOther Black quarterbacks have signed rich contract extensions, but that's not the point.\n\nThe point is Hurts' contract is another evolution in the arc of the Black quarterback. From the days of NFL quarterback segregation, to the gentlemen's agreement, to Kaepernick, and more. Black quarterbacks have had to fight for every yard, every dollar, every piece of dignity.\n\nPlayers like Hurts and Patrick Mahomes have risen on the shoulders of past Black quarterbacks that sacrificed their dignities so players like Hurts don't have to.\n\nWe won't see the eradication of racism from the NFL anytime soon, in the same way we won't see it eliminated from society. This isn't the Federation. Not yet.\n\nMore:NFL mock draft 2023: Jalen Carter falls in first round as Bijan Robinson rises\n\nHurts' deal does show, however, what happens when racism is removed from the equation. When a player is strictly evaluated for the content of his football character — and by all indications Hurts is one of the NFL's best leaders.\n\nHe said this after being named one of the team's captains: “It means everything. It means everything. I think just trying to do things the right way for the team and putting the team first and doing everything I can with all my ability to play at a high level for the team, lead in the right direction and set the right example for everybody. I take it in high regard and I give a lot of value to being a captain.”\n\nThe Eagles might have gotten a bargain with this extension because Hurts is that much the real deal.\n\nIn NFL history, there have been other Black men who could have been Jalen Hurts, but racism kept that from happening.

And there are things about the live experience that can't be captured in a livestream or a concert film — that whole communal vibe, the sensation of coming together as one nation under a groove, the traffic.\n\nBut we can relive the magic of actual performances while keeping a safe social distance from the comfort of our homes by watching classic concert films through streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime without spending a dime. (If you're already a subscriber to those services.)\n\nThis list is based on things we found a way to stream easily and at no added cost. You can certainly pay to watch \"Monterey Pop,\" the classic D.A. Pennebaker documentary that features that iconic scene of Jimi Hendrix setting fire to his Fender. And we highly recommend you do so if you've got the cash to burn like a Hendrix guitar.\n\nBut these won't put you over budget in these trying times.\n\n'Stop Making Sense' (1984)\n\nIt's the essential concert film, a timeless document of Talking Heads in their prime and their element, artfully starting a show with David Byrne alone on stage performing \"Psycho Killer\" to a beat we're made to think is coming from the boom box he's carried on stage.\n\nThen, bassist Tina Weymouth makes her entrance, sharing the edge of the spotlight on \"Heaven,\" followed by drummer Chris Frantz on \"Thank You For Sending Me an Angel\" and guitarist Jerry Harrison on \"Found a Job.\" It's a striking introduction to both the band and Jonathan Demme's masterfully directed film, a nearly 90-minute masterpiece overflowing with surprises.\n\nBy the time they hit the heavy-grooving arthouse funk of \"Burning Down the House,\" the stage is crowded with auxiliary players, from Parliament-Funkadelic keyboard ace Bernie Worrell to Brothers Johnson guitar god Alex Weir.\n\nAfter ceding the spotlight to Weymouth and Frantz for a crowd-pleasing \"Genius of Love\" by Tom Tom Club, their side gig, Byrne returns in what remains his most iconic stage look — the \"big suit\" — for \"Girlfriend is Better.\"\n\nDemme's film captures one of America's greatest live acts at their absolute creative zenith, clearly caught up in the joy of what they've managed to achieve. And at the center of that energy is Byrne, a dancing fool who remains one of the more endearingly idiosyncratic entertainers rock 'n' roll will ever know.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\n'Wattstax' (1973)\n\nStax Records held this concert on the seventh anniversary of the 1965 Watts riots. Richard Pryor introduces this Mel Stuart documentary on the day's events as \"a soulful expression of the black experience.\"\n\nAnd it certainly feels that way, as the tone is set with a series of interviews about the black experience as it stood at the time.\n\nAs Jesse Jackson says, before leading the crowd in a call and response of \"I am somebody\" with fists held high: \"This is a beautiful day. It is a new day. It is a day of black awareness.\"\n\nThen he brings out Kim Weston to kick off the concert with \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" which Jackson calls the Black National Anthem. The Staple Singers take the stadium to church while capturing the spirit of the black pride they were there to honor with a funky invocation to \"Respect Yourself.\"\n\nAnd after great performances by such Stax heavyweights as Rufus Thomas (lightening the mood with \"Do the Funky Chicken\"), an extremely charming Carla Thomas and the Bar-Kays, Isaac Hayes brings the film to a rousing conclusion with a very funky \"Theme From Shaft\" and the gritty social commentary of \"Soulsville.\"\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'LoudQuietLoud: A Film About the Pixies' (2006)\n\nThis documentary goes behind the scenes to capture all the awkwardness and tension that appears to have defined what life was like when Pixies chose to set aside the differences that cause them to implode in 1993 and launch perhaps the most successful indie-rock reunion tour in history 11 years later.\n\nKim Deal travels on a separate tour bus with her sister Kelley to preserve her own sobriety while David Lovering gets hooked on Valium and Joey Santiago struggles to keep his composure as the house of cards begins to fall in on itself.\n\nThat can make for some fairly uncomfortable viewing, if not quite on the level of the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" or Wilco's \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.\"\n\nBut other than one scene of Black Francis storming offstage in a huff when Lovering has some kind of drug-related episode behind the kit, the time they spend on stage together, reconnecting with the songs on which their legend ultimately rests, it's obvious why this was such a celebrated tour.\n\nIt also serves as a thrilling reminder that these Boston rockers were a revolutionary force without whose often-duplicated whisper-to-a-scream dynamic it's hard to imagine what rock music in the '90s would've sounded like. It certainly wouldn't have been as explosive.\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'The Last Waltz' (1978)\n\nThis Martin Scorsese film captures the Band signing off with a farewell concert for the ages on Thanksgiving Day, 1976. Whatever underlying tensions led them to leave all this behind don't come through in the playing, which is often joyous and as sharp as ever.\n\nIn addition to their own performance, they rounded up such iconic fans as Neil Young, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Van Morrison, Emmylou Harris and Neil Diamond to join them.\n\nBob Dylan’s performance alone would make this concert more than worth your while. Robbie Robertson squeezes out sparks at the helm of Dylan's most inspired backing band — the Band, of course — on a beautiful version of \"Forever Young,\" which gives way to a fiery “Baby Let Me Follow You Down.\"\n\nThen, everyone crowds the stage to join in on a stately, gospel-flavored version of Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released,\" the perfect ending to a damn near perfect concert.\n\nAnd Scorsese fleshes out those live performances with backstage interviews to put the show in context with an eye toward elevating both the Band and this particular concert to the mythic status they've enjoyed for decades now because of it.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\n'Live at the Paramount' (2011)\n\nThis concert film captures Nirvana live in 1991, rocking Seattle on Halloween night in the midst of changing everything with \"Nevermind,\" the breakthrough album they'd released just five weeks earlier.\n\nIt's a bracing reminder of just how undeniable a force these guys were at that point in not only their trajectory but rock 'n' roll's trajectory, arriving just in time to save the day. This is what history felt like before it was history, preserved on 16 mm film.\n\nGranted, the concert gets off to a somewhat muted start with a cover of the Vaselines song, \"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam.\" But it feels more like the calm before the storm when Dave Grohl's drums kick in on an electrifying \"Aneurysm.\"\n\nKurt Cobain sings like his voice is a raw nerve he can't stop himself from touching, shredding vocal cords with each intensely vulnerable cry, from \"Drain You\" to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to \"About a Girl.\" He sounds tortured and wounded and fully committed to coaxing some salvation from these songs.\n\nHis guitar work is just as cathartic, harnessing feedback while leading his bandmates through a steady stream of primal fuzz-guitar riffs.\n\nIt's the sound of rock 'n' roll ready to conquer the world again. And it did.\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'Amazing Grace' (2018)\n\nDirector Sydney Pollack's documentary on the making of Aretha Franklin's classic gospel album of the same name, a live two-record set recorded in 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, was shelved for nearly 40 years due to technical problems.\n\nThen they figured out a way to synchronize the audio and video and it was scheduled for release in 2011. That's when Franklin sued, delaying its release until after her death in 2018, at which point Franklin's family gave the film its blessings.\n\nIt's a stunning document of Franklin in her soulful prime, the daughter of a Detroit minister connecting with the gospel music of her youth with the assistance of a choir and a small soul combo while accompanying herself on piano at times.\n\nShe's clearly caught up in the spiritual transcendence of the moment, from the opening line of \"Holy Holy\" through \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\" to \"Amazing Grace\" and more.\n\nYou don't have to be religious to get caught up in the spirit of a talent as timeless as Franklin's connecting with a higher power. You can feel her feeling it and that's what matters here.\n\nWhere to stream: Hulu.\n\n'The Song Remains the Same' (1976)\n\nHow many concert films start with a series of fantasy sequences, one involving a gangster werewolf, another featuring John Bonham on a tractor? Fortunately, I can only think of one.\n\nBut it's worth it to get to the music Led Zeppelin performed at Madison Square Garden over the course of three nights in the summer of '73. Additional footage was shot later at Shepperton Studios.\n\nYou're 12 minutes into the foolishness before the concert starts, Bonham bashing his way through the opening beat of \"Rock and Roll.\" Even that doesn't signal the end of the fantasy sequences. Not by a long shot.\n\nAgain, the concert footage is its own reward. It's Led Zeppelin in their misspent youth, on the road in support of \"Houses of the Holy,\" rocking their way through such obvious highlights as \"Black Dog,\" the Jimmy Page solo that ushers in a slow-burning \"Since I've Been Loving You\" and \"Dazed and Confused.\"\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'Shut Up and Play the Hits' (2012)\n\nDo we really need to know how many Thomas Pynchon books James Murphy owns? We do not. But establishing shots are what they are in documentaries of this nature.\n\nAfter eight minutes and change of precious little in the way of action, Murphy expresses his dissatisfaction at how slowly things are moving, speaking for us all when he says, “We want some of this time back.\"\n\nOnce they kick off the concert with \"Dance Yrself Clean\" a bit later, though, all is forgiven.\n\nThis was supposed to be LCD Soundsystem's final performance, a four-hour victory lap that finds them dusting off an awe-inspiring number of their greatest hits at Madison Square Garden. It's a brilliant performance that's beautifully captured by directors Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern.\n\nAnd the interviews actually add to the experience, much like that earlier \"Last Waltz,\" offering real insights into what makes Murphy tick.\n\nWhere to stream: Hulu.\n\n'Homecoming: A Film By Beyoncé' (2019)\n\nBeyoncé directed this film of her headlining set at Coachella. And she fully captured the impact of that moment, taking the stage as a queen, an image of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti on her cape, and as the first black woman ever to headline America's premier music festival.\n\nLike Richard Pryor said of Wattstax, this performance is a soulful expression of the black experience. But it's just as much a celebration of Beyoncé as a galvanizing force in American culture, as well as a two-hour tribute to historically black colleges and universities.\n\nShe's in total command of the moment from the time she swaggers through her royal entrance to a stage that's packed with an array of dancers and a marching band and choir on stadium bleachers.\n\nShe's already undergone her first of several costume changes by the time she's sung her first word, the marching band's horn section lifting a stunning performance of \"Crazy in Love\" to new heights.\n\nHighlights range from an uplifting \"Freedom\" to \"Sorry,\" \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\" and a Destiny's Child reunion. Meanwhile, her behind-the-scene narration offers fascinating insights into her creative process.\n\nIf you still don't get what makes Beyoncé an iconic entertainer after watching this performance, maybe you're just not meant for Beyoncé's world.\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix.\n\n'Heima' (2007)\n\nThis is a stunning document of Sigur Ros staging a homecoming tour of Iceland, which offers a breathtaking backdrop to the cinematic grandeur of the band's emotionally charged yet ethereal post-rock.\n\nThere are open-air performances and smaller events in unlikely locations — from a dimly lit cave to community halls and a deserted fish factory — and an unplugged performance for family and friends at a coffee shop. Even the indoor concerts often cut away to scenes of the Icelandic countryside.\n\nThe effect is transcendent in ways that couldn't hope to complement the music more effectively. At times they incorporate singers and musicians from the town they're visiting into the mix.\n\nIn many ways, this film could be the perfect introduction to the band for those who may not be familiar with their music. It's also the closest a 21st-century concert film has come to rivaling the artistry of Demme's masterful \"Stop Making Sense.\"\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\n'Sign o' the Times' (1987)\n\nThis self-directed concert film was shot to hype the masterful two-record set with which it shares a name, capturing Prince in his late-'80s prime, with most songs (and between-song segues) filmed at Paisley Park.\n\nSheila E. makes her entrance on the title track, marching onstage at the front of a drum line and taking her place behind the drum kit for the second song, an exultant rendition of \"Play in the Sunshine.\" Prince is in top form as he makes his way through several costume changes, tearing it up on guitar while showing off his sexiest James Brown moves.\n\nThe set draws primarily on \"Sign o' the Times,\" including such obvious highlights as \"U Got the Look,\" the title track and \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man.\" But he throws in a smoldering, gospel-flavored re-imagining of \"Little Red Corvette\" for old time's sake.\n\nIt didn't set the multiplex on fire like he'd done with \"Purple Rain\" just three years earlier, but its stature has grown over time.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\n'The Kids Are Alright' (1979)\n\nThis is the film that introduced my generation to the glory of the Who, first seen here on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" Tommy Smothers asks Pete Townshend where he came up with his legendary windmill move. Townshend quickly answers, \"That was bowling.\"\n\nAnd so it goes, a series of loopy exchanges giving way to a truly explosive performance of \"My Generation\" that ends in an actual explosion as Townshend smashes his guitar. Keith Moon had rigged his kick drum to explode, which it does. Then when Smothers returns, Townshend grabs his acoustic guitar and smashes it to bits. It's the Who in a nutshell — the power, the humor, the chaos, the destructive urges.\n\nJeff Stein's film takes fans on a journey from their early days through Woodstock to their final performance with Moon, an epic \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" filmed just three months before his death.\n\nIt also features candid interviews with Townshend and the greatest live performance in the history of rock 'n' roll — \"A Quick One, While He's Away\" at \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus.\"\n\nNew York Times reviewer Janet Maslin dismissed it at the time as \"willfully uninformative.\" But everything you need to know about the Who is right there in those live performances.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\n'Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970' (1998)\n\nYes, this is a second entry on the Who. A lot of people still consider them the greatest live band in the history of rock (myself included). And a large percentage of those fans would point to this film, captured more than a year into touring on \"Tommy,\" as the most compelling documented evidence to support such a claim in the form of a concert-length film.\n\nIt features them rocking a festival crowd within months of a similar concert at Leeds University that led to the seminal \"Live at Leeds\" release, an album often celebrated as the greatest live recording any rock act ever made.\n\nYou'd never know they took the stage at 2 a.m.\n\nThis is that rarest of all breeds of concert films where when nearing the end — they start \"We're Not Gonna Take It,\" the anthem that brings \"Tommy\" to a close — there's an overwhelming sadness knowing it's almost over. I want every concert film to mess with my emotions that profoundly.\n\nIt helps that Moon and Townshend are such entertaining lunatics to witness. Their antics kept making me smile and laugh and gasp and, on occasion, blurt out a reaction at the screen while John Entwistle, rocking a skeleton shirt, was making my jaw hit the floor with his stellar musicianship.\n\nThe physicality of Townshend throwing his entire body into the performance makes the music that much more electrifying, with his endless stream of jumps and windmills. And Moon is a rock 'n' roll madman on the kit throughout. This is a document of everything that made the Who so special in the first place.\n\nThe only downside is director Murray Lerner edited it down from a three-hour set to not quite 90 minutes. Now that we're all stuck inside, it may be time for him to run that other 90 minutes up the flagpole and see who salutes.\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'Under Great White Northern Lights' (2009)\n\nThis Emmett Malloy documentary follows the White Stripes' Canadian tour in the summer of 2007, both onstage and off, in support of \"Icky Thump,\" the band's final album.\n\nDid they know this was their final tour? There's no mistaking the emotion in that last scene, in which Meg White weeps on the piano bench as Jack White sits beside her singing \"Easy come, easy go / Be a star of the show / I'm giving up all I know to get more.\"\n\nIt ends a hug that couldn't be more awkward or more genuine, a disarmingly bittersweet coda to a film that feels more like a celebration of the chemistry that made them the 21st century's most electrifying bet for keeping rock 'n' roll alive.\n\nThe action begins with the trash-rocking splendor of a raunchy \"Let's Shake Hands.\" Guitarist Jack White turns to his partner, one of rock's most underrated drummers, coming out of a squealing guitar break to remind her \"You can do what you want to, Meg.\"\n\nThey effortlessly live up to the promise of that opener on highlights as relentless as \"Black Math,\" \"Ball and Biscuit,\" \"Icky Thump\" and \"Seven Nation Army.\"\n\nAnd when they do ease up on the accelerator, those moments are just as engaging, from Meg's lead vocal on \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" to \"We Are Going to Be Friends\" and an electrifying rendition of Bacharach and David's \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself.\"\n\nWhere to stream: YouTube.\n\n'If It Ain't Stiff, It Ain't Worth a F' (1977)\n\nThis documentary chronicles a U.K. package tour designed to hype the roster at Stiff Records, a pioneering indie label whose stars included Wreckless Eric, Ian Dury & the Blockheads, Nick Lowe, Larry Wallis and a bespectacled computer operator who'd taken the name of a previous rock 'n' roll legend in vain, a savage young Elvis Costello.\n\nAs a snapshot of an oft-neglected yet exhilarating moment in the history of the U.K music scene, it definitely rises to the challenge. As a concert film, it's even more engaging, lo-fi though it is.\n\nLowe leads a band of Stiff all-stars and his Rockpile bandmates Terry Williams and Dave Edmund, in \"Heart of the City,\" a version that filters the reckless abandon of punk through the musicianship of pub-rock veterans.\n\nCostello makes the most of the dramatic possibilities of \"Watching the Detectives\" at the helm of the freshly assembled Attractions, as talented a backing band as any in the history of rock.\n\nAnd Ian Dury does his best to steal the show, leading his bandmates in an exhilarating rendition of \"Blockheads\" before calling back his label mates to join him on the star-studded finale, \"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll.\"\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

First of all, that two decades just blew by and then we started our commemorative shows here in the Valley at the Yucca Tap Room in February. We did 12 or 13 of those Yucca shows. And then we hit the road in March and didn’t get back until the end of November. So it was the earliest start and the latest finish to a tour. We saw a lot of people and we had a lot of fun. But as I looked at it on the calendar, going into it, it looked like it would be a really long year. Now I look back and think, ‘Where did it go?’ I guess I have to lean on that old maxim: Time flies when you’re having fun. I kind of wish I could do it again, it was so much fun.”\n\nPeople have been asking if they plan on celebrating any other anniversaries.\n\n“Fans are asking ‘Well, how many anniversary records are you doing?’ Because ‘The Bottle & Fresh Horses’ comes up next year and then in 2019, it’ll be ‘Honky Tonk Union.’ But I’m still writing music. We did a lot of writing, actually, this year. And we’ve begun our sort of preliminary discussions with a really cool producer – a cat who’s in Los Lobos, Steve Berlin. He’s overseeing our direction right now in terms of production.”\n\nBerlin is a brilliant producer and a perfect fit, in many ways, for Clyne’s approach to rock and roll.\n\n“I love his work,” Clyne says. “I love his ethos. He came to a couple of shows of ours in Portland, came backstage, hung on the bus and said, ‘Look I only work with what I like and I really like what you’re doing. I want to do your record.”\n\nAt this point, it’s all just a matter of lining up schedules.\n\n“We’ve already shared about nine songs with him that he’s already given us some good comments and direction on,” Clyne says. “We’re doing our very best to line up our schedules in time to get it out by June. I feel really blessed that he’s a fan and we could stumble into him. I’ve been in the business a long time, but he’s been in it longer and his body of work is impressive. When a guy like that stoops down and says, ‘I want to work with you,’ it feels odd but very good.\n\nThe goal is to record at Wavelab Studio in Tucson.\n\n“So we’re hoping that our touring schedule, the studio’s availability and his touring schedule allow us to get in there in February and March,” Clyne says, “which means as soon as we’re done with these ’76 songs, we’re gonna start doing pre-production in early January here at home. It’s a pretty ambitious schedule, but we’re hopeful.”\n\nAs to how it’s shaping up, direction-wise, Clyne shrugs it off with “I don’t know. And I’m OK with that. Typically, I have a statement of intent before I go into writing a record. But with this one, the only thing I wanted to do was to not lean on all my old habits, because as a writer, I’ve got 20 years of habit. Some of them are successful and some of them aren’t. And I wanted to make sure that before I used these devices again, that I was scrutinizing them. I really tried to stretch the envelope in my writing in terms of subject matter and chord progressions and compositionally. There’s clearly something to be said for pop sensibility but I’m trying to stretch out and listen to stuff like Los Lobos or we were just talking about Jeff Lynne. Those guys shed a lot of light on the art form and I’m standing here kind of in awe while trying to incorporate the new stuff they’ve been showing me.”\n\nAsked if there’s anything else he’s looking forward to in the new year, Clyne says, “Yeah, we’re doing the return of January Jams, our little festival in Mexico. Circus Mexicus in June is our big one and then we do kind of a miniature one in January. We skipped it last year in favor of rehearsals for the ‘Fizzy Fuzzy’ commemorative shows. So we’re bringing it back and we’re doing it at three different venues which we haven’t gotten to do for a while. Traditionally, January Jam is just at JJ’s Cantina. But this year, we’re doing the 13th at Banditos, then the 14th at JJ’s and the 15th at Wrecked at the Reef. We’re doing different sets each night and Jared and the Mill are going to accompany us. So I’m stoked to be getting back down there and putting that back on the calendar.”\n\nThe Darts sign to U.K. label Dirty Water Records, album due next summer\n\nLast month, the Darts threw a record-release celebration at Valley Bar in honor of their first EP.\n\nNow comes news that they've already signed to Dirty Water Records, the in-house label of a legendary London club night named in honor of the Standells' \"Dirty Water.\"\n\nAn all-female garage/psychedelic rock supergroup featuring Nicole Laurenne and Christina Nunez of the Love Me Nots together with Michelle Balderrama of Brainspoon and Rikki Styxx of the Dollyrots, the Darts joined forces early this year when the Love Me Nots went on what Laurenne says is a \"a semi-permanent hiatus.\"\n\nThey've released two EPs in the past few months and the hope is to have a full-length effort out on Dirty Water by next summer.\n\nLaurenne says she's been trying to get the attention of Dirty Water for years \"because of their perfect taste in trashy garage punk and their great media presence.\" And it's easy enough to hear why a label like that would take an active interest in the Darts, whose music more than lives of to the promise of putting those particular musicians in the same room -- especially given the reckless abandon with which they make their way through tracks as instantly engaging as \"Revolution\" and \"Carry Me Home.\"\n\nDirty Water \"finally stopped ignoring me this Fall,\" Laurenne says. \"One of their PR guys, a real sweetheart named Matt Hunter, came to the US and asked to meet with me in Phoenix. There was an instant connection, being that we know a lot of the same bands and people around the world, and have pretty much the same taste in music.\"\n\n\"It's a solid indie label,\" Laurenne says, \"that will allow us a ton of freedom to do what we want creatively but will also give the Darts a presence overseas, which has been one of the band's goals. The label is connected closely with Trash Can Radio, an exciting new UK-based radio show that is starting to come into its own, and it also has top notch physical distribution worldwide. We are really looking forward to playing in Europe this May and putting out a new full-length release on the Dirty Water imprint over the summer. The band could not be more psyched about what 2017 holds.\"\n\nAs for this year, it still holds a Phoenix show on Saturday, Dec. 17, at Lost Leaf with the Vooduo and 16 Eyes. The action starts at 9 p.m.\n\nSnake! Snake! Snakes! return with even more new music for 2016\n\nIt’s only been eight months since Snake! Snake! Snakes! released “Tranquilo,” as strong a contender as I can imagine for the title of best local album of the year. And here they are with something new – a four-song EP called “Wait Up,” recorded at Tucson’s Midtown Island Studios with producer Matt Rendon.\n\nAnd if the first track they’ve shared from the EP – a piano-rocking opener called “Breakdown” – is any indication, it would seem this record picks up pretty much exactly where the last one left off, with reckless abandon to spare.\n\nThe full EP should be released before the week is out. And they’re planning on making a video. In the meantime, you should definitely check out “Breakdown.”\n\nBassist Christopher Sanchez says, “We had no plan for the release whatsoever. It was kind of by accident really. We were supposed to go on a small weekend tour through New Mexico and Colorado, but were having trouble getting bands and venues locked so we just decided to cancel and use the days to go record.”\n\nThey’d heard about Rendon through friends who had recorded there, he says, and they had nothing but great things to say. Now, Snake! Snake! Snakes! have nothing but great things to say as well.\n\n“We think it sounds great,” Sanchez says of the EP, which Rendon recorded and mixed in three days in October. “And he really captured what we felt we sound like live.”\n\nCrescent Ballroom's biggest New Year's Eve block party yet\n\nCrescent Ballroom has announced the details on its biggest New Year's Eve block party yet. The club is blocking off both Second and Third avenues outside the venue with entertainment by Kalliope & the Walter Show, DJ Sean Watson and Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra.\n\nCrescent owner Charlie Levy says, \"Every year, New Year’s Eve at Crescent gets bigger and bigger. This year, we’re expecting thousands of people and the thing that makes it exciting for us is all the different experiences under one roof.\"\n\nMost of the action is actually under one sky, taking place outside the venue.\n\n\"We’re getting the guys from Walter Productions to bring all their fun, crazy art cars from Burning Man to take over the back parking lot and Third Avenue with their artistic direction and Burning Man sensibility,\" Levy says. \"So we’re gonna have a really fun dance party in the back lot. Inside Crescent, we want to kind of keep it a little more relaxed and quiet, where if you want to go and have a cocktail and sit at a table and have maybe a little bit more of a quiet evening, you have that going on. And then we’re closing down Second Avenue to have Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra play outside with some really fun DJs. Plus, with the balcony now, you can sit on the balcony and watch them do their thing.\"\n\nLevy says there's something very special going on at midnight in that back lot.\n\n\"I can’t tell you what it is,\" he says. \"But everyone is gonna have their cellphone out taking pictures of this.\"\n\nPhoenix Afrobeat Orchestra's David Marquez says, \"It's going to be an Apocalyptadelic-it's-the-end-of-the-world-so-lets-go-crazy vibe with human capital, flames from the depths of the earth, and the most raw/primal grooves to dance the night away!\"\n\nTickets are $17, on sale now at crescentphx.com.\n\nJimi Hendrix pedals and amp to be auctioned in Scottsdale\n\nA small yet truly awe-inspiring treasure trove of musical items once used by the late Jimi Hendrix is going up for auction New Year's Day at J. Levine Auction & Appraisal in Scottsdale. The items – a wah-wah pedal custom-built for Hendrix prior to his legendary Woodstock set, an amp used in his earliest days at the helm of the Hendrix Experience, and a prototype three-transistor fuzz pedal – have been consigned by Dave Weyer, or the Amp Doctor, as he’s been billed.\n\nWeyer, who designed both pedals and repaired and modified the amp, worked with many of the premiere artists of the Woodstock era, including Neil Young, Crosby Stills and Nash, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Vanilla Fudge, Three Dog Night, and Ike and Tina Turner.\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of time reviewing the provenance, listening to audio recordings, and examining photos and films from Woodstock, and we are confident that this was the wah pedal Jimi used during Woodstock,” said Antoine Gedroyc, J. Levine’s instruments and audio manager and consignment specialist. “It’s an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent such an important part of music and American history.”\n\nWeyer says of the wah-wah pedal: “It can be identified by the lack of a Vox logo on the front, the relief where the logo was supposed to be glued on, a West Coast sticker on the bottom, and Jimi’s signature on the inside of the casing wall, applied at a difficult angle, but identifiable nonetheless — and, of course, the things he loved the most, the low noise and the sharp sweep, clearly audible in the Woodstock recordings.”\n\nSebastian Bach signing memoir in Phoenix\n\nSkid Row frontman Sebastian Bach will be in Phoenix on Monday, Dec. 12, to sign his new memoir at Changing Hands Phoenix.\n\n\"18 and Life on Skid Row\" discusses his rise to fame, touring with the likes of Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Motley Crue, Soundgarden, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails and Guns N’ Roses, the breakup of his band and his personal life.\n\nIf you go: 7 p.m. Monday, Dec. 12.

This is all before she's transformed into Glitter McQueen.\n\n“It's pretty straightforward really,\" the singer explains. \"We worked with Frank Thomas to convey a pretty obvious message complete with ‘perfection’ manifesting as a literal mannequin. The chorus harkens to the overall concept - that we just ‘can't seem to get it together.’ It can be incredibly difficult to live up to others’ ideals of how you should be, but in the end it's all Glitter McQueen - a fabrication of what's beautiful, or cool, a facade. It's a shallowness. The video kinda shows the artist process we go through. The alone-in-a-room-scratching-out-some-chords phase... to creating something... to sharing that something (aka the party scene) which can really be one of the most fun parts. Followed by the glamorized photoshoot scene -- which was meant to show that aspect of trying to fit a particular mold or be liked and accepted. Often to be ‘good enough,’ we fight the compulsion to change everything about ourselves. That's why the character in that scene looks so strikingly different than the others. To show a false image. Art makes us vulnerable, but our hope is to not let that hold us back from being sincere.”\n\nThere is No Us mixing EP with Slayer producer Terry Date\n\nPhoenix’s There is No Us have enlisted the aid of famed metal producer/engineer Terry Date, whose credits range from Metal Church to Deftones, Pantera and Slayer, to mix their new EP at his Seattle studio.\n\nDate says, “With the current events in America, the message in their music is as important and relevant as ever, and that's exciting.”\n\nScheduled for a spring release, \"Generation of Failure” finds the local rockers taking aim at Donald Trump, economic inequality, political corruption and online bullying.\n\nSinger Jim Louvau says when he and guitarist Andy Gerold, a former member of Marilyn Manson, first started working on music together, they were writing songs with Date in mind.\n\n“So it felt like the perfect match when he decided he wanted to be a part of the project,” Louvau says. “Terry's back catalogue of records includes some of the most important metal releases all of time but what really struck us was newer records he's produced like Bring Me The Horizon's 'Sempiternal.’\"\n\nLouvau and Gerold formed There Is No Us in early 2015 to “expose the failure of the human race,” as they put it, adding bassist Amy Abramite and guitarist Jared Bakin to the fold before releasing their debut EP, \"Farewell To Humanity,\" in September.\n\nSupport the station that supports the scene at KWSS-FM Pledge Drive weekend\n\nWe’re heading into Pledge Drive Weekend for the community-driven independent station most likely to spin your favorite local music, KWSS-FM (93.9). And they’re kicking it off this Friday with a local-music showcase at Pho Cao, where you should definitely plan on eating lunch or dinner, maybe both, because the food is awesome. They’re broadcasting live from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nFor those who may be wondering “Why a pledge drive?,” I can answer that.\n\nKWSS-FM is a non-profit station that relies on listener support to underwrite expenses such as music licensing, promotional materials, broadband connectivity, studio and transmitter facilities, insurance, power, web hosting and phones to consider. Unlike NPR or PBS, KWSS is not a part of a larger network of stations. FCC regulations requires the station to be fully independent and locally operated here in Phoenix.\n\nThis is why they can support so many local artists. That and the exquisite taste of folks like Dani Cutler, who says, “The reason I have been volunteering my time to KWSS for nearly 10 years now is not only for my love of music, but the community. We are supportive of each other and all I want to do is help these local bands be recognized for their talents and hard work. Our station is the only independent alt-rock station on the FM dial, and we have the freedom to give them the air time they deserve. The Pledge Drive is a great introduction to KWSS and many of the bands we support.”\n\nYou can make donations now at http://bit.ly/PledgeDrive2016\n\nOr go to Pho Cao Friday to check out this lineup of locals.\n\n11:00 AM Ruca\n\n12:00 PM Mikey Foresteater\n\n1:00 PM Mill's End (Jeff Bump)\n\n2:00 PM Shawn Johnson\n\n3:00 PM The Glides\n\n4:00 PM Exploding Oranges\n\n5:00 PM Manic Monkeys\n\nJimmy Eat World join Artists for a Trump-Free America\n\nJimmy Eat World have joined forces with R.E.M., Moby and more in the Artists for a Trump-Free America project 30 Days, 50 Songs. It was originally 30 Days, 30 Songs, but so many artists came forward with music, they had to expand it to 50.\n\nThe Washington Post has declared it “a playlist of songs that Donald Trump will hate” and no fewer than four of the songs were featured on our Best October Singles playlist, from Aimee Mann singing “I don’t want this job / My god, can’t you tell? I’m unwell” in character as Trump to Death Cab for Cutie’s “Million Dollar Loan.”\n\nThe goal of the project, according to David Eggers, who assembled the playlist with Jordan Kurland, is to “motivate voters to stand against bigotry, sexism, hatred and ignorance.”\n\nThe 38th song in the series, released today, is Jimmy Eat World’s “My Enemy,” a jagged post-punk track that would have fit right in with the themes they address on “Integrity Blues,” their latest album.\n\nThe lyrics are more about letting go of the fears Jim Adkins feels the Donald Trump campaign has been manipulating than it is about the candidate himself. And like Jim James’ contribution to the project, “Same Old Lie,” it’s a perfect fit that also works outside the context of songs for a Trump-Free America.\n\n“There are dangerous and very real consequences for using fear of ‘The Other’ to motivate a potential electorate,” Jim Adkins. “While that’s nothing new in politics, what is newly alarming in context of the current presidential campaign, is how seemingly effective that strategy has been for a certain candidate. That candidate used the low-hanging fruit of fearmongering to gain his initial momentum and continues to employ variations of it to sustain his place. The only way to steel yourself against that kind of manipulation is to do the real self-work in discovering and letting go of your own fears. While that pursuit is difficult because it means fighting against your own ego, it remains worth the effort — not just for what it can do for us as individuals but even more for what it can do for our collective society. Are you willing to accept that maybe, just possibly, what you feel as a threat, isn’t?”\n\nOr, as he sings in the song, “You feel the tide is rising / That water’s cold as hell / Think enemies surround you / Everyone, except yourself.”\n\nTrunk Space reopens\n\nWell, it looks like the end of the end of an era. The Trunk Space will reopen in a new location less than five months after closing its doors on Grand Avenue.\n\nThe venue has issued the following statement about the new digs in Grace Lutheran Church that reads as follows:\n\n\"The rumors are true. The Trunk Space is BACK.\n\n\n\nAfter just under five nomadic months, we will have a stable home once again for DIY arts in downtown Phoenix. Yes, we are at Grace Lutheran Church. Maybe you’ve visited at one of our recent pop-up shows? The space we’re occupying is on the south side of their campus, in a space most recently occupied by a health clinic, and a Montessori school. We will continue to provide an open space for performance and art of all kinds, with an emphasis on that of the weirdo persuasion. Our stage will continue to be uncensored, and we already have several exciting shows in the works for you all.\n\n\n\nWe chose this location for a number of reasons, being walking distance to light rail and three high schools, across the street from our friends at Phoenix Center for the Arts, with plenty of parking onsite, walking distance to bars and restaurants, and still close to a variety of other music venues and art spaces.\n\n\n\nWith the new space, we’re very excited for new opportunities: art studios, classroom space, and a green room. All of these are in development and we’ll let you know as these get finalized. Our new performance room is about the same size as our old space, but slightly more square. And we have access to the Church’s basement, courtyard, multi-purpose room, and sanctuary for special occasions with acts that might be suited by a different space. And, hey, we might still host pop-up shows with our friends at FilmBar, Phoenix Center for the Arts, and 51West if the occasion calls—we’re flexible!\n\nAlso, we are now a nonprofit! Thanks to the fiscal sponsorship of Carefree Write Productions, we can now accept tax-deductible donations. To help with startup costs, we have set up a Razoo crowdfunding page with some fun rewards here: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Trunk-Space-Opening\n\nThe Trunk Space is and will always be all ages, low-cost, volunteer-centered space ready for performance and art of any kind you can create. See something missing? Let us know, and let’s make it happen.\n\n\n\nWhen the Trunk Space decided to leave our long-time home on Grand, we considered leaving for good. Don’t want that to happen? THEN WE NEED YOU! The Trunk Space needs and will always need donors, coffee wizards, door people, bookers and promoters, art installers, sound engineers, social media managers, street team, and anything else that might keep this space running. Now is the time to make an impact.\n\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you soon, and stay tuned for show announcements, volunteer needs and more. In the meantime, shoot us a message at thetrunkspace@yahoo.com. We’ll be needing your help to get this thing off the ground.\n\n\n\nWE ARE EXCITED.\n\n-Steph, Connor, Aislyn, Jose, Robbie, Amy, Ben, Seth, Alex, and the rest of the Trunk Space family\"\n\nFairy Bones added to national tour after opening sold-out Crescent Ballroom show\n\nBeing added to a sold-out show at Crescent Ballroom is always a cause for celebration when you’re playing in a local band. Chelsey Louise of Fairy Bones recalled the mood as they were heading into the Sept. 21 show with Highly Suspect: “The day of the show we were so excited, like kids on Christmas status.” And that’s before it even turned into an invitation to join the Grammy-nominated rockers on a string of West Coast dates.\n\nAs Louise and her bandmates were loading out after the show, their first since April, they started talking to the Highly Suspect crew and tour manager. “The conversation basically went like this,” Louise recalls. “’You guys were great, I wish you were on more shows with us!’ ‘We would love to. We will drop everything and do that.’ ‘Oh! Are you guys seriously local?’ ‘Yes. But we can be national?!’\"\n\nThe next day, Louise woke to an Instagram comment from the group’s lead singer, Johnny Stevens, saying they all enjoyed Fairy Bones’ set and they should do it again sometime.\n\n“We thought, cool; that's (expletive) amazing they like us that much, first show back,” Louise says. “Maybe they hit us up next time they play Phoenix. But then I got a call, asking if we wanted to do some upcoming tour dates. Starting next week. And I literally cried.”\n\nThe dates, which start Sept. 29 in Fresno and run through Oct. 10 in Montana, fit perfectly into their schedule. They’d taken some time off to record a single (which made our list of 15 Songs You Need To Hear Right Now) and didn’t have any shows planned until their single release show Oct. 14 at Rebel Lounge\n\n“And like we said to them, we would drop everything and go,” Louise says. “We only work to pay for the band, our house and food. Matt and I ran to Ben’s room to tell him the news and he was like, ‘Maybe they'll fire me.’ In the end, you're not gonna look back and think, ‘Boy am I glad I kept my dead end job.’ S--t like this doesn't happen without sacrifice. If you're serious about a career in music, you know that going in.”\n\nThe Sept. 21 show was the first time Louise had played guitar on stage.\n\n“So it was a really intense show for me,” she says. “All the songs are new, too. We don't have synths or piano anymore. I think this really made it feel like the ‘hiatus’ was worth it. Some really s---ty things happened to me, and I completely changed the way I write songs. I think that night and landing this tour felt really validating.”\n\nThaahum catches ear of 'Luke Cage' show developer\n\nPhoenix rapper Thaahum is so hyped for the Friday, Sept. 30, series premiere of “Marvel’s Luke Cage” on Netflix, he collaborated with another local artist, DJ Big Serg, on a video to celebrate the series. And the show’s developer, Cheo Hodari Coker, has tweeted about it twice since the track premiered Sept. 15 on YouTube, thanking Thaahum for the shout-out.\n\n“As an artist,” Thaahum says, “I feel some of the best music comes out of doing songs about things we like and are fans of ourselves. Being a Marvel fan and hearing that they were releasing a series that has hip-hop elements in it was just the thing to spark my creativity.”\n\nHe reached out to DJ Big Serg because he's also a comic book fan.\n\n\"Then once we realized we had a dope track,\" Thaahum says, \"we figured the next step would be to make a video out of it, and further hype the September 30th release of Luke Cage. Over the years I've done things like this in the past with great success. Rosario Dawson did a comic book called 'The Occult Crimes Taskforce' that I did a mixtape based on. It actually ended up in her hands & she really liked it. And years before that I did a couple songs about Kevin Smith movies that he liked as well.\"\n\nOn the track, Thaahum sets the tone by rapping, \"We'll be glorious the day we see / the Notorious C.A.G.E. / One-fourth of the Defenders' amazing team / No pretenders when it comes to get they streets clean.\" And before the track is through, there's a shout-out to Jessica Jones, whose Netflix series also features Cage.\n\nEuromerica comp raises funds for Parkinson's research\n\nMelanie Rogoff, an Arizona State University student who hosts a show called Euromerica on ASU's KASC 1330 AM Blaze Radio, has assembled a second compilation CD benefiting Parkinson's disease research.\n\nReleased in mid-December, “Euromerica and Friends: Volume 1” raised more than $1,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease Research.\n\n“Which is huge,” Rogoff says, “because that was the first time that I ever organized a charity CD. In addition, thousands of people from around the world gained an awareness of Parkinson’s Disease and the CD also exposed them to the amazing talent on the CD.”\n\nThe business management major started reaching out to artists about “Volume 2” in May, revisiting the first collection’s blend of local acts and artists from around the globe. This time, there are seven local acts, including IAMWE, Luxxe, Wanderer and 76th Street. The other artists are from California, New York, England, Switzerland, Australia and France.\n\n“To tie in with my radio show, Euromerica (a blend of pop/dance music from Europe and America), I wanted to really have more international artists in comparison to national artists,” Rogoff says. “I feel like a lot of people in America aren’t exposed to international artists unless they’re relatively mainstream, and I really want to expose people to the talent that not only lies within America, but from all over the world. I tried to aim, especially with the second volume, to have as much variety as possible.\"\n\nThe CD is available for sale at http://euromericaradio.bandcamp.com/releases through March 15.\n\nThe financial goal for this “Volume 2” is $1,200.\n\nAnother goal, she says, is “I thought to myself, ‘If I could introduce a superstar team of artists to the world, who would I have, and what would it look like?' Asking that question allowed me to figure out what artists I wanted to have, and, in turn, helped me realize my musical goal, which is exposing as many people as possible to some of the humblest, hardest-working and talented artists that I have had the pleasure of working with. I certainly would love to spread the word about my radio show as well.\"\n\nTo find out more about the compilation or Euromerica, go to Facebook.com/euromericaradio or Twitter.com/euromericaradio.\n\nWyves rock Tilted Kilt ads\n\nLocal rockers Wyves have been selected for a nationwide campaign of TV ads for Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery. \"Jump Into The Water,\" the opening track on Wyves' new album, \"Spoils of War,\" plays under all the ads. In the longer ads, there is a point where you can see three members of the group \"performing\" along to the music (although drummer Evan Knisely is shown on keyboards).\n\nKnisely explains the unusual arrangement: \"(Bassist) Brenden (McBride) was out of town at Outside Lands, so we put (guitarist) Nick (Stirling) on bass, and they said no drums but wanted me to still be in it so we just stuck me on keys.\"\n\nWyves posted the news on Facebook, saying, \"We couldn't be happier to have our music featured for this thriving Arizona based company.\"\n\nWATCH: Tilted Kilt ad featuring Wyves' song \"Jump Into the Water\"\n\nJimmy Eat World plays 93.3 Alt AZ Zombie Prom at Fear Farm\n\nJimmy Eat World have announced a string of fall tour dates, including a stop in the Valley at Fear Farm – yes, Fear Farm -- in support of “Integrity Blues,” an album due to hit the streets Sept. 30.\n\nThe Fear Farm date of Saturday, Oct. 22, is the 93.3 Alt AZ Zombie Prom, which makes more sense than just a random date at Fear Farm. Also playing? Good Charlotte, the Struts, Lewis Del Mar, Barns Courtney, K. Flay and the Hunna.\n\nWatch: Haymarket Squares channel Woody Guthrie's spirit, talk reefer madness at azcentral studio concert\n\nThis is their ninth release and follows “Damage,” their fourth consecutive to go Top 20 on the Billboard album charts.\n\n“Integrity Blues” was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnson, Beck’s musical director.\n\nJim Adkins explained the inspiration for the album in an open letter to the fans:\n\n“It is about throwing away your default responses to life, accepting life on the terms of life and becoming willing to accept the best any of us have is to be in a state of progress.\n\nEmotional injury is usually our own making…our ego fighting to selectively ignore reality that may not reflect our expectations. When we allow a moment of honesty and look at the gap between our expectations and reality, all too often we find a place to identify as a victim. We take the disappointment gap personally. There is some kind of sick rewards in the imagined moral high ground. Self-righteousness leads to rationalizing tantrum behaviour (which is never a good look!) adding back into the feedback loop reinforcing a lack of self worth.\n\n“Your enemy is you. And unfortunately you know every button to push, every hidden fear and every secret regret. You speak to yourself in your own voice. And you have a very convincing pitch to work against your betterment in the hopes of those finish-line type expectations, maybe… finally… bringing you a sene of peace this time.\n\n“You break that reverse feedback loop of reinforcing negative self-worth through action.\n\nDoing your best to accept and live as a person doesn’t mean you’re always going to be happy. Staying one the best path you can may feel like lonely work sometimes. But then, happiness is one of those fleeting finish lines. Integrity matters because if you let the answer of ‘Who do I need to be?’ inform your question ‘What should I do?’, there just isn’t room for that negative cycle to get traction.”\n\nRoger Clyne & the Peacemakers tour \"Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy\"\n\nRoger Clyne & The Peacemakers are taking “Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy” by his old band, the Refreshments, on the road for a 20th anniversary tour that starts tonight in Austin, Tex.\n\nUniversal Records re-released the album earlier this year on vinyl and a tribute record is forthcoming with singles from Miles Nielsen (“Blue Collar Suicide”) and the Yawpers (“European Swallow”).\n\n22 local Phoenix music picks for September 2016\n\nThe Refreshments major label debut, “Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy” put the local rockers on the map out of Tempe’s thriving music scene in 1996. It peaked at #97 on the Billboard Top 200, and spun off the modern-rock radio classic “Banditos.”\n\nAll Clyne had in mind going into the making of the album was to “put those songs together so that it could be a classic,” as he told us earlier this year, going on to admit with a laugh, “We were aiming pretty high. But I think every new band should. And in a few people’s minds, we hit the mark.”\n\nClyne and the Peacemakers honored the 20th anniversary of the album earlier this year by playing the entire album, start to finish, in a run of 10 dates at their former stomping grounds, the Yucca Tap Room.\n\nAs I wrote in reviewing the seventh of those Yucca shows: “The Peacemakers approached those 20-year-old songs with an enthusiasm that managed to hit on all the right nostalgic notes while sounding as alive and in the here and now as if they’d written them a week or two before the show.\n\n“Of course, a number of those songs have gone on to be staples of the set. But hearing them played in the order in which they appeared on that Refreshments album on a stage where many of those songs were more than likely shaped by live performance was its own unique experience — which may be why all 10 shows sold out in a hurry.”\n\nThe Peacemakers are also in the midst of recording their eighth studio album for release early next year.\n\nThe tour dates are as follows.\n\nSeptember 8: Austin, TX @ Antone’s\n\nSeptember 9: Dallas, TX @ Gas Monkey Bar & Grill\n\nSeptember 10: Houston TX @ Firehouse Saloon\n\nSeptember 11: New Orleans, LA @ Parish Room\n\nSeptember 13: St. Louis, MO @ Blueberry Hill\n\nSeptember 14: Des Moines, IA @ Wooly’s\n\nSeptember 15: Sioux Falls, SD @ Icon Lounge\n\nSeptember 16: Minneapolis, MN @ Cabooze\n\nSeptember 18: Chicago, IL @ Lincoln Hall\n\nSeptember 20: Ferndale, MI @ The Magic Bag\n\nSeptember 21: Cleveland, OH @ The Grog Shop\n\nSeptember 22: Milwaukee, WI @ Shank Hall\n\nSeptember 23: Omaha, NE @ The Waiting Room\n\nSeptember 25: Fort Collins, CO @ Downtown Artery\n\nOctober 1: Chandler, TX @ SanTan Brewing Oktoberfest\n\nOctober 8: Albuquerque, NM @ Launchpad\n\nOctober 10: Kansas City, MO @ Knuckleheads\n\nOctober 11: Bloomington, IL @ The Castle Theatre\n\nOctober 12: Nashville, TN @ The High Watt\n\nOctober 13: Atlanta, GA @ Smith’s Olde Bar\n\nOctober 15: Falls Church, VA @ State Theatre\n\nOctober 16: Philadelphia, PA @ World Café Live\n\nOctober 17: New York, NY @ The Highline Ballroom\n\nOctober 19: Providence, RI @ Fete\n\nOctober 20: Teaneck, NJ @ Mexicali Live\n\nOctober 21: Hartford, CT @ Infinity Hall\n\nOctober 22: Cambridge, MA @ Middle East Downstairs\n\nOctober 23: Pawling, NY @ Daryl’s House\n\nNovember 12: Portland, OR @ Hawthorne Theater\n\nNovember 18: San Diego, CA @ Belly Up Tavern\n\nNovember 26: Flagstaff, AZ @ Orpheum Theatre\n\nBeef Vegan leaves Phoenix for Tucson\n\nThese are bittersweet days for fans of local music.\n\nBeef Vegan, who took over hosting the TMI Radio Show on KWSS-FM (93.9) in 2009 from a studio set up in what should have been his living room, is moving to Tucson after seven years as the best friend a local musician could hope to have in radio.\n\nBut it’s good news for Vegan, whose real name is Brad Pfirmann (yeah, I know, I always wanted to believe it was his real name, too).\n\nHe’s taken a job at one of Tucson’s three-biggest corporate radio stations, where he’ll co-host and produce a morning show.\n\nThat’s all the information he can give us at the moment. TMI? Not this time.\n\nAs Vegas explains the vow of silence, “They want to do this big unveiling with a press release, which sucks. All I can say is I’m going down to one of the top three stations in Tucson. That’s why I’ve been Vaguebooking. I don’t feel good about it. I’m like, “Oh, I’m THAT chick.” But I did it for a reason. They’re gonna do this whole advertising campaign. I think they’re gonna do a ‘Where’s the Beef?’ teaser campaign they’ve been joking about. They’re making kind of a big deal about it, which is cool, especially since I’m coming down there as the No. 2 guy.”\n\nHis last day on the air in Phoenix is Friday, Aug. 26. He’ll be broadcasting live from 6-11 a.m. from Stinger’s Sports Bar & Grill at 43rd and Peoria avenues in Glendale.\n\n“We’re doing one last Tequila Sunrise,” Vegan says. “It’s a great opportunity for all the listeners to come out to meet each other and say hi and goodbye to the show. We’re gonna have a bunch of performances from musicians and comedians. And jam sessions and games. It’s really a rare thing to be able to kind of get closure on something like this. Usually, people in radio, they get fired and you just don’t hear from them. A week later, you’re like, “Hey, whatever happened to so-and-so?” We get to do a victory lap and read listener feedback and play some of our favorite songs from the last seven-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe even has a final song picked out, which will, of course, be local.\n\nWhen I spoke to Kongos earlier this year, they talked about Vegan's support and what it meant to them.\n\n“Beef Vegan started playing us in 2011,\" Jesse Kongos told me. \"And obviously it’s a small station with not a lot of power, but it had a core listenership and we were like, ‘All right, there’s this guy Beef Vegan. Let’s send him our songs.’ Then, he tweeted that he was gonna spin it. So we listened and he was, like, raving about it.”\n\nWith Vegan’s support, their shows in Phoenix started getting bigger, and as Jesse says, “We were like, ‘Oh, so people hear our music and then they come to the show? That’s a good sign.’ ”\n\nNot that local is the DJ's only legacy on local radio.\n\n“A lot of people focus on the local-music aspect in the quote-unquote scene,” Vegan says. “But I think it was larger than that. I’ve gotten a lot of messages from people who say that it made them want to listen to radio again. And it wasn’t just local music. There was a lot of unsigned national and global music, a lot of under-the-war, not-corporate-playlist music that we got people passionate about. It was great to be able to be a tastemaker and live up to the person that I was compared to since I was 13. As soon as I hit puberty, old people all the time were like, ‘You sound like Wolfman Jack. You sound like Wolfman Jack.’ I didn’t even know who Wolfman Jack was. I was 13 years old growing up in the gangsta-rap era but I was already passionate about radio.”\n\nHe has mixed emotions.\n\n“I’m happy and proud,” he says, “that I accomplished an impossible goal through being insane enough to overwork myself and never give up and I’m sad that I created something very special with little to no help that I take immense pride in and now I’m leaving that behind. But I felt like it was definitely the time to kind of move forward in my career and do what’s right for me and my daughter. And that was to get paid and get health benefits and a 401K and become an adult, I guess.”\n\nAs for that last Tequila Sunrise, in addition to surprise performance, he's promising a lot of crying.\n\n\"You'll hear grown men cry on the radio,\" he says. \"You'll hear grown women cry, too. There will be a lot of f--king crying. Crying and tequila. Those shots of tequila will be coming through their tears.\"\n\nThe Haymarket Squares have 'Carpool Karaoke' moment with a U2 cover\n\nThe Haymarket Squares have gone \"minor-league viral,\" as singer Marc Oxborrow puts it, with a video recorded in a moving van that shows them performing a bluegrass rendition of U2's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\" Oxborrow singing lead vocals while driving as his bandmates accompany him on harmonies, accordion, harmonica and mandolin.\n\nThe video was shot somewhere in southern Colorado as they traveled from New Mexico to Colorado Springs on a nine-date tour that wraps this weekend with three gigs in one day – a festival date, a radio appearance and a bar show.\n\nPhoenix music news: Haymarket Squares have their own 'Carpool Karaoke' moment\n\nThey posted the video Sunday, July 31, to their Facebook page. In less than a week, it's been viewed more than 44,000 times while earning more than 600 Facebook reactions and 542 shares.\n\nAs Oxborrow explains the inspiration for the video, \"We like to make videos on tour, and often spend our time in the van working on harmonies and arrangements. So we figured it was time to combine the two and tackle a whole song. And we've finally got a van quiet enough not to drown out our voices in road noise.\"\n\nIt's a great arrangement of a great song, but watching them do it is half the charm, especially Oxborrow's facial expressions as he sings and drives. He's a videogenic guy, which is part of the reason they ended up topping our list of the best local videos of the first half of 2016 with \"Let's Start a Riot.\"\n\nWhy a U2 cover?\n\n\"There was an element of randomness,\" Oxborrow says, \"in keeping with the off-the-cuff feeling of filming in a moving vehicle. We wanted a song we hadn't performed before, something that we could learn quickly and would show off our harmonies.\"\n\nThen, he jokingly adds, \"And some of us may have been U2 fans in the distant past.\"\n\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Latest concert announcements | Top concerts this week\n\nGlendale renames itself Paradise City for Guns N' Roses concert\n\nIt's our understanding that the grass will be green and the girls will be pretty on Monday, Aug. 15, when the city of Glendale will symbolically change its name for a day to Paradise City in honor of the Guns N' Roses concert playing University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nThe \"Not in This Lifetime Tour\" marks the first time Guns N’ Roses founder Axl Rose has shared a stage with Slash since 1993. The other founding member taking part in this year's biggest rock tour, Duff McKagan, has played dates with Rose as recently as 2014. Rolling Stone described the tour as a “triumphant return of one of the most important bands to cross rock music history.”\n\nLeaving their formal meeting attire behind and wearing Guns N’ Roses T-shirts, Glendale’s City Council members unveiled plans Wednesday, July 20, to celebrate the tour stop with a temporary name change. Mayor Jerry Weiers issued a proclamation calling for Glendale to be named Paradise City on Aug. 15, and a large sign welcoming fans to Paradise City was unveiled. Over the weeks leading up to the concert, fans will see other ways the city is setting the stage for a rock and roll paradise, including billboards welcoming Guns N’ Roses to Glendale.\n\n“Having lived in the West Valley my entire life and seeing the transformation of former farmland into the place where Super Bowls and championships are played and where top performers book their shows is exhilarating,” said Glendale Councilmember Samuel Chavira, who represents the Yucca District, which includes the stadium and adjacent Westgate Entertainment District. “It certainly does not get bigger than having one of the world’s best-selling bands of all time perform here and we are ready to welcome these rockstars to Paradise City.”\n\nGuns N’ Roses’ place in the rock-and-roll history books was secure from the day they crawled out of the gutter with their first full-length release.\n\n\"Appetite for Destruction\" felt as much like a rejection of the status quo in 1987 as the Sex Pistols' \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" had a decade earlier. But Guns N' Roses took their revolution to the masses in a way the Pistols never managed, topping the charts with the reckless abandon of a first release that sent three singles to the upper reaches of the Hot 100, including the chart-topping \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" — a power ballad with actual power.\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since they followed the spontaneous combustion of their masterpiece with the ambitious twin release of the \"Use Your Illusion\" albums.\n\nThey started losing members during the sessions for \"Use Your Illusion\" with the 1990 firing of drummer Steven Adler. Izzy Stradlin, the rhythm guitarist who'd written or co-written nine of the 12 songs on \"Appetite,\" quit in 1991, followed in 1996 by Slash, with McKagan staying on until his 1997 resignation.\n\nBogan Via reissue EP, announce headlining tour dates\n\nPhoenix synth-pop duo Bogan Via, who released a great new track called \"Throw It on the Fire\" earlier this year, are now releasing a deluxe reissue of their \"Wait Up\" EP with brand new remixes. Available for presale now at hellomerch.com, the reissue is a limited-edition 12-inch vinyl run of just 250 copies on transparent red with blue haze virgin vinyl.\n\nAll purchases include free digital download of the EP and an unreleased extended Director's Cut of Freddie Paull's inspired music videos for \"Kanye\" and \"Gatsby.\"\n\nIn other Bogan Via news, they've just announced their first headlining tour, which launches in Seattle on Sept. 28.

Located less than a half-mile from the US 60 freeway in the Mesa South Shopping Center, the store features the usual Zia assortment of pop-culture necessities – music on vinyl and compact disc, movies, games, books, toys, comics, musical instruments, electronics and a wide selection of T-shirts, posters and more.\n\nIt's the farthest east the local chain, which opened its first store in 1980, has gone in the Valley, a distinction previously held by Zia's Chandler superstore.\n\n\"So we're pretty excited to get to Mesa,\" says vice president and general manager Brian Faber. \"And it's so close to the US 60 that I feel like it's going to be really accessible for people even farther east.\"\n\nWhy Mesa?\n\n\"We've been such a strong East Valley chain for much our existence, from our Tempe store being a flagship location for so long and adding Chandler to the family,\" Faber says. \"So Mesa just made sense. We really looked Valley-wide and this particular opportunity presented itself and it was the right fit for us. Right place, right time, great landlord and it's been great to work with the city of Mesa.\"\n\nThe goal, Faber says, is \"to bring the total Zia experience\" to Mesa, from in-store appearances to offering cash and store credit for used items.\n\nAdding to Faber's excitement, he says, is the fact that it's their first all-new location in the Valley in a long time for the chain, which also has stores in Las Vegas and Tucson.\n\n\"The other local stores have all moved and expanded in the past 10 years,\" he says. \"But in terms of opening a purely new store in the Valley, it's the first one in 10 years. So we're pretty excited. This is a brand new store in a brand new city for us. We're proud to be a part of the city of Mesa's business family. There's already some good record stores and some good entertainment stores in Mesa and we're happy to join that group.\"\n\nZia Records Mesa will fill the rest of 2016 with special events — in-store signings, live music and a Black Friday bash, featuring limited edition vinyl, CDs, and a store-wide sale.

Gilbert Rd, Mesa, AZ, 85204.\n\nJimmy Eat World on Rolling Stone best pop-punk album list\n\nJimmy Eat World have made another all-time best-of list in Rolling Stone. And this time, they're pop-punk, not emo, joining Green Day, Blink-182, Generation X and the Ramones on a list of the 10 Best Pop-Punk Albums of All Time.\n\nThe Ramones?!!\n\nWell, that's just silly, right? They are definitively punk, no qualifiers needed.\n\nBest punk debut albums of the '70s: Ramones and Sex Pistols to Patti Smith and Wire\n\nIt's a reader's poll, but Rolling Stone does appear to condone the confusion when it writes, \"If the Ramones set the groundwork for what pop-punk would become, Green Day made it a radio reality.\"\n\nAs for Jimmy Eat World, I wouldn't call them pop-punk, either, but they made the list with \"Bleed American.\"\n\nRolling Stone writes that \"Jimmy Eat World may have arguably been the point where pop-punk and emo merged, making the two genres closely related in the new millennium. Heavy riffs became intertwined with emotional depth as the band were direct about their feelings and offered tender comfort on tracks like 'Sweetness' and 'The Middle.' While early pop-punk had a bit more snarl, Jimmy Eat World were the pop-punk band you could bring home to mom.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Valley rockers placed two local classics in the upper reaches of Rolling Stone's countdown of the 40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time.\n\nReleased in 1999, \"Clarity\" placed 13th on the list, one spot ahead of Weezer's \"Pinkerton.\" \"Bleed American\" placed 9th, edging out Fall Out Boy's \"From Under the Cork Tree.\"\n\nAt the time, Jim Adkins told us, \"I don't consider them 'emo' at all. It's amazing to know those albums still are important to people. Flattering. But, it would be my personal take that while some of the records were coming from a generally similar scene, what 'emo' means could be debatable. Maybe that's just it. It's sort of the blanket term for bands who happened to be touring and recording around a certain time. With a similar outlook on how to operate.\"\n\nWe didn't ask him how it felt to make a pop-punk list because we're pretty sure we know the answer and the man has more important things to do than tell us why that album isn't pop-punk.\n\nCait Brennan inks a demo deal with Seymour Stein\n\nThe legendary Seymour Stein, now President of Sire Records and Vice President of Warner Bros. Records, has offered Cait Brennan a deal to cut a demo for the labels with producer Andy Paley.\n\nStein is known for having signed such pioneering Hall of Famers as Madonna, the Pretenders, Talking Heads and the Ramones. Paley has produced recordings by the likes of the Ramones, Madonna, Brian Wilson, Debbie Harry and Jonathan Richman.\n\nBrennan is a Phoenix-based artist who after a Kickstarter campaign that managed to raise more than $7500 was able to release her debut album, “Debutante,” early this year. She’s 47.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to process,” Brennan says. “Seymour Stein discovered and signed Madonna, the Ramones, Talking Heads, brought us the Smiths, Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Undertones, k. d. lang, Ice T, Against Me! The list is endless. Of course I was hoping he might be interested in my stuff but the music fan in me just wanted to ask him a trillion questions. Nothing is in any way final or certain; he may hear my demos and pass, but that there was even enough interest to get this far. To even get to meet with him let alone be asked to make music for him, is the absolute highest of compliments.”\n\nStein heard “Debutante” and loved it, which led to a meeting when Brennan flew to New York City for some shows.\n\nAZCentral also loved the album, weighing in with, \"This pop classicist has packed her first album with songs that marry timeless hooks to introspective lyrics. Setting the tone with the wistful, McCartney-esque intro of “Good Morning and Goodnight,” the singer delivers an album that should speak to several generations of power-pop enthusiasts, whether they cut their teeth on Big Star and the Raspberries or Teenage Fanclub in the ‘90s.\"\n\nStein also told Brennan — repeatedly — that she had \"one of the greatest and most unique voices he’d ever heard,” she says. “I have been pretty much impossible to live with ever since. Maybe he says that to all the girls, I don’t know, but considering the legendary artists he’s worked with over the years, it was one hell of a compliment.”\n\nNow, she’s heading to Los Angeles to track four to six songs with Paley on the label’s dime.\n\n“If Sire likes the demo,” Brennan says, “then we'll begin negotiation about a full record deal; if they don't, they can either ask me to do other demos or we can shake hands and walk away. So there's no obligation for them to sign me (or for me to sign) but it's definitely something that has the potential to lead to a full deal. It's a modestly-budgeted demo session, I'm not getting paid, but it's an opportunity. With Andy at the helm, we will likely record at Reseda Ranch Studios, where I recorded both ‘Debutante’ and my upcoming second album, Introducing ‘The Breakdown According To Cait Brennan,’ with contributions from my co-producer and musical collaborator Fernando Perdomo (who currently plays in Jakob Dylan's band).”\n\nAnd regardless of what happens, the deal allows her to record with Paley.\n\n“It’s ridiculously great to get to work with him,” she says. “He’s a musical savant and has an amazingly warped sense of humor. He really gets my songs. But he’s obsessed with the lyrics. There’s a woman-scorned revenge theme in a few of my songs, and Andy’s constantly asking me ‘Is that true? did that actually happen? did you really do that to the guy?’ A lot of the time the answer is a qualified ‘Kind of, yes’ but once in a while I have to say ‘Yes, Andy, I locked a guy in an Airstream and set it on fire with kerosene when he cheated on me, then I fled the jurisdiction and flew to Amsterdam with my lover.’ And he takes two hesitant steps back and goes ‘I can never tell when you’re kidding.’ I think I should keep it that way.”\n\nShe’s hoping to release “Introducing The Breakdown According to Cait Brennan” in mid-October.\n\n“If Sire decides they want me for keeps, that may change,” Brennan says. “But for now, we’re proceeding as if nothing has changed and I’m still the same plucky, unsinkable indie-gal with a heart of gold as always. The Susan Boyle of indie glam and soul, really. Even if nothing else comes of it, it’s just quite an honor. To go from 800 bucks in loose change to Seymour Stein’s office. Not a bad life for a kid who grew up in the desert in a trailer park out by Turf Paradise.”\n\nGin Blossoms are cutting their new album with the R.E.M. production team of Don Dixon and Mitch Easter\n\nTaylor Upsahl, Wolvves in Best May singles playlist\n\nTwo local artists made our best our best May singles playlist, joining the likes of Rihanna and Radiohead. You can hear the songs and read what won us over here.\n\nRPM Orchestra films video at Trolley Museum\n\nHow did RPM Orchestra come to shoot their music video for \"Song of Sheba\" inside a street car at the Phoenix Trolley Museum?\n\nAs Pete Petrisko, who supplies the shortwave radio effects on the recording and directs the video explains, \"We knew we wanted a location that fit the era of the slang heard in the lyrics. At the same time, news broke that the Phoenix Trolley Museum would have to find a new location. That's when we decided to make the restored trolley itself the star of our video. It's a creative way to raise public awareness about the museum, and its pending relocation, by showing this downtown treasure to a wider audience.\"\n\nThat required them pitching the video concept and story outline to the board at the museum for approval, but after that, the museum stayed out of their way. \"They were very supportive,\" Petrisko says, \"of us following our own creative vision.\"\n\nThe video opens with a haunting toy-piano melody complemented by archival footage of a trolley shot by Phoenix businessman Bob Miller in 1948. The scene is an excerpt from the \"Our Last Trip\" DVD that's shown to museum visitors.\n\nIt’s when Jocelyn Ruiz starts singing that the action shifts to the Petrisko shot inside the street car housed at the museum. The passengers go about their business as a woman in white (long-time collaborator, choreographer/dancer Debra Minghi, with whom they’ve done live multi-disciplinary performances in the past) makes her way down the aisle.\n\nTheir first collaboration was “BUTOH+MUSIC,” performed at Bragg's Pie Factory during Art Detour 24. The second, “Animalogue,” was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts' Our Town grant program, as part of Roosevelt Row CDC's A.R.T.S. project series in 2013. They’re also collaborating on “Displaced - An Immersive Theater Experience,” set to premiere Oct. 1 at Unexpected Gallery.\n\nBut getting back to “Song of Sheba,” Minghi had free rein, Petrisko says, to choreograph her movements as “a metaphorical retort to the idea that a woman's assumed role is that of pretty bride or perfect angel, set in an era that included passage of the 19th amendment, a sexual revolution embodied by the flappers of the Roaring '20s, and women entering the workforce in increased numbers during WWII.”\n\nPetrisko directed a couple of one-off music videos for local bands a few years ago, he says. “But this more cinematic approach is new territory. I'm working out a visual storytelling style here, with an eye toward creating original film shorts (scored by RPM Orchestra) in the future.”\n\nin addition to Ruiz (on vocals, keyboard, toy piano) and Petrisko, \"Song of Sheba\" features Jim Dustan on bass, Erik Hunter on drums and percussion and Vic Void on laputaphone.\n\nFormer KTAR producer in Justin Timberlake video\n\nIf you've seen the video released this week for Justin Timberlake's new summer smash \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" then you probably recall a very animated dancer in a Member's Only jacket busting loopy moves outside a car wash.\n\nThat's David Moskowitz, who moved to LA after 13 years in news/talk radio here in metro Phoenix, including lengthy stints at KFYI and KTAR, where he produced the Marconi Award-winning \"Preston Westmoreland.\"\n\nNews/talk radio may not seem like a stepping stone to a role in a Timberlake video. In fact, when Moskowitz first read the email blast from a casting director saying, \"If you like to dance,\" his initial reaction was: \"Dancing’s not really my thing, but what the hell? I’ll give it a shot.”\n\nHe didn't know he was auditioning for Timberlake. The email that led the aspiring actor to overcome his suspicion for casting auditions held at a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf only referred to a \"MAJOR recording artist.\"\n\nMoskowitz was thinking it could be Beyonce. Or Ariana Grande. Maybe even J.Lo. Either way, it seemed worth driving to a coffee shop.\n\nAs he recalls: \"The guy with the iPad who was shooting me for about three minutes put a Bluetooth speaker on the ground, and he plays Michael Jackson’s 'Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough.' So, I start doing my MJ moves. I start moonwalking. Granted, it wasn’t smooth like Michael Jackson. I’m a White, Jewish balding guy moonwalking. I did backwards and forwards, did spins, did my mime, acted like I was smoking a joint. I don’t smoke pot for reals. I did all kinds of crazy stuff. Then somebody popped out of a store next to the coffee shop and started applauding when I was done.\"\n\nDespite the applause, he was worried that maybe he'd blown the audition after complaining of a lack of signs directing him to the audition when he showed up to the coffee shop, where none of the employees knew a thing about it.\n\n\"I told the guy, 'Hey Mike, I was just sort of venting to you because I’m sitting here for 15 minutes. I didn’t know who to ask. There’s no sign. I hope you don’t hold this against me.' I thought I'd totally blown it. Then I get a call 9 in the morning from the guy who I thought hated me. He said, 'You were the director’s first pick. Are you available these dates?' I was blown away.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just any director, either. Mark Romanek has won 20 MTV Video Music Awards and three Grammys.\n\nAs for Timberlake? Mokowitz says, \"He was so down-to-earth, personable, warm and friendly. I just think the world of his talent. I had the utmost respect for the guy even before I did this video. So it was a pleasant surprise finding out who it was for.\"\n\nMatty Steinkamp's 'Play' makes timely plea for music education\n\nOriginal Alice Cooper lineup writes new music\n\nWill Alice Cooper's next album include a reunion of the four surviving members of the lineup that produced such early Cooper classics as \"Killer\" and \"Love it to Death?\"\n\nThat's the word on the street. And the person who put the word out there is no lesser an authority on all things Alice Cooper than Cooper himself.\n\nIn an interview with the Weekender, Cooper said, “I wrote three or four songs with (drummer) Neal Smith and (guitarist) Mike Bruce. And so we worked together in Phoenix for about two weeks just writing songs and demoing songs. And you never know which ones are going to make the album, but I said let’s do that.\n\nCooper added “(Bassist) Dennis Dunaway wrote two or three things. We haven’t seen those yet, but I know Dennis has always written great stuff. It’s fun to go back and work with guys you haven’t worked with in awhile. It’s not trying to recapture your youth. It’s trying to recapture a sound. And it’s a very elusive sound.”\n\nThis should come as fairly awe-inspiring news to Cooper fans.\n\nWhen Dunaway and Cooper met, the singer hadn't yet adopted the ghoulish persona that made him a star. He was still Vince Furnier, class clown and student athlete at Cortez High School on the northern edge of Phoenix. They bonded in Mrs. Sloan's art class over their interest in Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte and shared their first onstage experience at a Cortez talent show, spoofing the Beatles for their classmates with another future member of the Alice Cooper band, Glen Buxton, who died in 1997.\n\nAt first, they were known as the Earwigs. Changing their name to the Spiders, they recruited Bruce, a North High football player, and scored a big regional hit with a single called “Don't Blow Your Mind.” After changing their name yet again, to the Nazz, they relocated to Los Angeles in 1967, where Smith, a Camelback High grad who'd been in art classes with Dunaway, Cooper and Buxton at Glendale Community College, joined on drums.\n\nThe rest, of course, is history, from massive hits to major tours. In 1973, their U.S. tour in support of the chart-topping “Billion Dollar Babies” broke box-office records then held by the Rolling Stones. In 2011, they took their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nKONGOS most-added at U.S. alternative radio\n\nThat new Kongos song, \"Take It From Me,\" is the most-added track of the past two weeks at alternative radio across the country, currently climbing the U.S. alternative radio charts at No. 19. Meanwhile, the video, which features the brothers in \"Big Head Mode\" from the video game \"NBA Jam,\" has racked up more than 165,000 views on YouTube/Vevo in less than a week.\n\nIn other big news, Fox Sports handpicked Kongos as its artist of the month for May. As part of this initiative, four songs from \"Egomaniac\"—“Take It From Me,” “I Don’t Mind,” “I Want It Free,” and “Look At Me” — will be played during broadcast sports events all month-long.\n\nThe Paradise Valley brothers hit the mainstream hard in 2014 when a three-year-old song from \"Lunatic,\" \"Come With Me Now,\" became the double-platinum breakthrough most bands only dream of. The song enjoyed a five-week run at No. 1 on the Billboard alternative-songs chart while earning the Kongos brothers — Johnny, Jesse, Dylan and Danny — a deal with Epic Records, home of Michael Jackson and the Clash.\n\nCould \"Take It From Me\" be the song that builds on that momentum?\n\nWritten by Jesse, the song tops a pulsating dance beat with an accordion riff that's sure to speak to anyone who came on board with that big single, a chant-along chorus, a pitch-shifted vocal hook, hiccups in all the right places and a brilliant slide-guitar lead. \"Take It From Me\" has been part of the live set for a while now. There’s a video on YouTube of them playing an early version of the song at Summerfest in 2014, but the single sounds more like a pop hit. They’ve refined what worked and added elements that lend a more contemporary vibe to the proceedings.\n\nWhen I spoke to Dylan in December, he talked about the long road to recording “Egomaniac.”\n\n\"It’s been a long time that this album has been not necessarily in the works,” he said, “but we’ve been waiting to get around to it because it kind of took a couple years for it get rolling for us, and then we were already kind of moving on to this album. We had some of the material written, we were starting to work on it, and then when “Lunatic” took off, we put it on the back burner because we had to give “Lunatic” a real shot with touring and supporting the album. So we were really excited to finish touring this year and get started on this album. There are some huge songs. Without getting into the details, there’s a common theme to the whole album, and sonically it’s just a really big sound. There’s a lot of layering and really big drums. We were really going for an in-your-face kind of sound.”\n\nThe album hits the streets on June 10.\n\n16 Phoenix artists with new music in the works, from Roger Clyne to AJJ, Kongos, Diners and Love Me Nots\n\nThe Maine take on a Justin Bieber song for 'Covers (Side B)'\n\nLocal rockers the Maine have recorded a cover of the recent Justin Bieber single, \"Love Yourself\" as the first taste of a sequel to December's \"Covers (Side A),\" aptly titled \"Covers (Side B).\"\n\nThe \"(Side A)\" EP featured 90’s pop tunes reinvented by the Maine with guest appearances by Technicolors' Brennan Smiley and Mayday Parade’s Derek Sanders.\n\nDrummer Pat Kirch says, “It is always a great learning process to see how other songwriters put songs together. We always have a good time recording cover songs because of the lack of pressure. We like to use cover songs to take some chances with sounds that we normally don't try.”\n\n“Love Yourself” will premiere on the Maine's website at 5 .m. Thursday.\n\nWhy \"Love Yourself?\"\n\nJohn O’Callaghan explains.\n\n\"To Beliebe or not to Beliebe is not the question here because no one can deny the quality of Sir Justin's tune. We haven't fully converted to the church of Bieber just yet, but we decided to try our hand at covering this religious hymn.”\n\nIt's not a jokey cover, either. In fact, it's kind of weird that Bieber's single spent two weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, but the Maine's recording feels more like a pop hit — a richly textured, atmospheric Wall of Sound with O'Callaghan bleeding emotion all over the vocal.\n\nThe track listing for \"Covers (Side B)\" has not yet been announced in full but Kirch says, \"We have not covered any current songs in a long time so we wanted to branch out and try something current.”\n\nThe \"Covers (Side B)\" EP is out.\n\nTaylor Swift singing and dancing to Jimmy Eat World\n\n\"OK, activities,\" she says. \"Getting ready to go out.\"The minute-long video starts with her looking for something to play on her iPhone, walking us through the process with narration. Taylor Swift has released an Apple Music ad that features her dancing and singing along to \"The Middle\" by local rockers Jimmy Eat World.\n\nWith that, she pulls up a menu titled \"Getting ready to go out\" and says, \"Oh my God, I love this song. I used to listen to this in middle school all the time.\"\n\nThen, the music starts and Taylor lip-syncs every line, dancing around her bathroom in a joyous display of total fan-girl abandon while using her lipstick as a microphone.\n\nDoll Skin drop full-length album\n\nDoll Skin -- singer Sydney Dolezal, guitarist Alex Snowden, bassist Nicole Rich and drummer Meghan Herring — have released a full-length version of their \"In Your Face\" EP, produced by David Ellefson of Megadeth. The bassist signed the teen sensations last year to his label, EMP, which is distributed by Megaforce, responsible for launching the careers of Anthrax and Metallica.\n\nRetitled \"In Your Face (Again),\" the new edition features nine tracks, including “Furious Fixation”, mixed by Richard Easterling (American Head Charge, Fuel), and a “Punk’D” demo version of their first single “Family of Strangers.”\n\n\"It's a rocking kick in the face that you don't want to miss,\" says Richie. \"We've got some fun new surprises on it and it'll leave you wanting more.\"\n\nThe video for current single “Let’s Be Honest” premiered exclusively via Revolver magazine earlier this month.\n\nThe girls are on tour now with Otep.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.Twitter.com/EdMasley.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columnists/chuck-campbell/2019/04/19/new-music-beyonce-homecoming-live-album-bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-lizzo-cuz-i-love-you-reviews/3519679002/", "title": "Miley Cyrus could be playing, or crying for help, with 'She Is Coming'", "text": "Miley Cyrus unapologetically celebrates sex, drugs and whatever might pass for rock ‘n’ roll these days with her new EP “She Is Coming,” a provocative, playful and sometimes disturbing collection of six songs.\n\nShe’s a promiscuous, drug-addled party animal here, and Cyrus certainly sounds authentic in this role of an antihero hedonist. But it’s hard to say if she’s simply dispensing an assortment of YOLO anthems or issuing a cry for help, and the answer to that won’t come until later.\n\n“She Is Coming” is the first of three EPs from Cyrus, and the trilogy will ultimately combine to form the collection “She Is: Miley Cyrus.” So the new release could be the premise of a three-part story that might also include a second act (conflict?) and a finale (resolution?).\n\nBut however it all shakes out, “She Is Coming” is a trip-hop-pop-dance hallucination, laced with expletives, festive themes and an air that is both liberating and uneasy.\n\nCyrus teams up with RuPaul for the raunchy, campy “Cattitude” propelled by a reverberating beat. propelling her as she boasts, “Since I was 3, I’ve been banging the drum.” She also declares herself “a little bit unholy” on “Unholy” and calls herself nasty, a freak and a witch on the trippy “Mother’s Daughter.” shrugging it off with, “Must be something in the water or that I’m my mother’s daughter.”\n\nOn “D.R.E.A.M.” – which stands for “drugs rule everything around me” – Cyrus seems indifferent or giddy about waking up with strangers and finding new tattoos on her body, and she loses herself in an ethereal sea of echoing voices and innuendo on “Party Up the Street” featuring Swae Lee.\n\nThe EP’s droll excess finally comes to a focus with the affecting ballad/closer “The Most” as the 26-year-old, emoting with the world weariness of someone twice her age, humbly conveys that she’s undeserving of love.\n\nIs that a personal epiphany or a plea for intervention? We’ll find out later …\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\n\"She Is Coming\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nEgerton nails Elton on 'Rocketman'\n\nThere’s every reason to believe the new Elton John biopic “Rocketman” will extend Hollywood’s music-drama blockbuster streak fueled by last fall’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “A Star Is Born.”\n\nPlus this one is happier than the others: Elton John is still living among us, and he even performs a new song on the soundtrack, “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again,” with Taron Egerton, who plays him in the film.For his part, Egerton holds his own with John on the duet and shines on the rest of the soundtrack as a believable alternative version of John rather than a pale imitation.\n\n“Rocketman (Music From the Motion Picture)” is a 22-track musical celebration of John featuring reimagined versions of most of his iconic songs as well as some of his less memorable ones.\n\nAnd fortunately, there’s no “Island Girl” to be found.\n\nThe soundtrack is campy (how could it not be?) and “Grease”-level cheesy at times, like with the wince-inducing renditions of “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)” and “Rock and Roll Madonna.” It also parallels “Mamma Mia!” in that some anticipated songs are prematurely truncated, including “Crocodile Rock,” “Pinball Wizard” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\nBut the frustrations and ho-hum moments seem inconsequential when Egerton and company elevate their game for spectacular (and sometimes entirely reinvented) versions of Elton John’s premium material.\n\nEgerton is impressive in the complicated structure of “Your Song” and commanding as “Rocket Man” escalates from a spacey sprawl into a boisterous sing-along. Meanwhile, the orchestrated “Tiny Dancer” and string-based “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word” are emotionally on point. And just when the soundtrack verges on getting too dark with the histrionic “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” up pops Egerton with a playful “I’m Still Standing.”\n\nIt’ll leave you feeling like a little kid.\n\nvarious acts\n\n'Rocketman' soundtrack\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRammstein hammers home theatrics\n\nIt might be an unexpected reaction to a Rammstein album, but the German band’s new self-titled release is oddly comforting.\n\nIrrespective of all the electric fury, disturbing themes and pervasive menace, “Rammstein” is sneakily melodic, the hooks and riffs are inescapably infectious, and the theatrics are rarely more threatening than that of a Disney villain.\n\nThese guys have been hanging together with the same lineup for a quarter of a century, and despite the decade-long gap since the last release, “Rammstein” is a seamless addition to the act’s discography – confident, otherworldly and distinct.\n\nIt’s also a good chance to practice your high-school German.\n\nOpening track/bombastic beauty “Deutschland,” where vocalist Till Lindemann wearily growls his ambivalent feelings for his homeland, re-introduces us to the gang and their trademark histrionics, blending metal and electronica to give a sidelong-glancing, dim view of humanity.\n\nThe Berlin-based band subsequently chugs through the mainstreamish “Radio,” propels across the operatic spectacle of “Zeig Dich” and rises from the sleazy miasma of “Auslander” for Lindemann’s spoken-theater wink at sleazy come-ons.\n\nLindemann serves more lessons from his pulpit, dovetailing into the dirty rock tease of “Sex” for a lewd proposal, and going even darker in the sister-as-sex-worker theme buried in suppressed whispers of “Puppe” and gliding along the horror-film score and child-abductor premise of closing cut “Hallomann.”\n\nYet even when he’s trying to lure someone into his car, presumably with the worst intentions, there’s something perversely inviting about it all.\n\nRammstein\n\n\"Rammstein\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nTodrick Hall ushers in Pride season\n\nTodrick Hall dropped his new “Haus Party, Pt. 1” just in time for Pride season across America, and he overflows with fitting confidence on the 7-track release.\n\nHall, who has become a music, Broadway, YouTube and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star since competing on “American Idol” a decade ago, is entrenched in LGBTQ tropes on the playful “Haus Party, Pt. 1” – drag culture, nightclub life and sex-charged innuendo.\n\nIt’s celebratory and fun, even if most of these tracks are disposable novelty songs.\n\nHall commands focus immediately with “Attention,” a frenetic pep rally of a dance track that turns both salty and suggestive, as when he calls out, “Tell your new boyfriend to stay out of my DM.”\n\nThe subsequent snaky “I Like Boys” is a self-assured coming out proclamation – complete with lines like, “Tell them girls, ‘thank you, next’.” And drag is celebrated on the strutting showoff song “Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels” and more effectively on “Chapstick,” featuring “RPDR” all-star Trixie Mattel and a winking assertion that the full-blown drag look is “just a little Chapstick.”\n\nHall isn’t merely playing for laughs on “Haus Party,” either. He shows a sweeter, romantic side (well, with obvious sexual overtones) on “Glitter,” employing a fine R&B vocal for lines like, “I wanna dance with you for life.”\n\nAnd in a late pivot, he offers the nightclub-as-church themed “Amen” and the sweeping EDM of closer “Relove,” the latter of which would suit mainstream radio, down to his modulated vocals.\n\nYet a problem with “Amen” and “Relove” is that they’re too conventional, forgettable background music that feels lackluster compared to the first part of “Haus Party, Pt. 1.”\n\nMaybe Hall will rediscover his momentum for “Pt. 2.”\n\nTodrick Hall\n\n\"Haus Party, Pt. 1\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nJepsen soft sells 'Dedicated'\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen’s new “Dedicated” is like an asteroid sailing in and out of other pop-star orbits.\n\nThe track “Now That I Found You” sounds like an electro-dance song from Robyn; the jumbly party cut “Want You In My Room” could come from Taylor Swift’s playbook; and the quirky robo-love ballad “Everything He Needs” is ersatz Kylie Minogue. Jepsen even time-travels to a Prince-inspired Sheena Easton bygone era with the crunchy-flutter tease of “No Drug Like Me.”\n\nThe Canadian singer’s audience will surely hear other artists echoing throughout “Dedicated,” which is both a testament to her adaptability and an indication that her persona is not distinct. Her voice is serviceable, if anonymous, her focus is relentlessly on infatuations (which is exhausting for a 15-track album built on several sluggishly paced cuts), and her writing structure is shamelessly formulaic.\n\nAt the same time, her lyrical idiosyncrasies and offbeat twists in the arrangements deliver redeeming charm to “Dedicated,” be it in the Theremin-ly effects of the winking “Everything He Needs” or the cathartic build of “Too Much.” Also, her exasperations are relatable – “I don’t have the energy to risk a broken heart,” she sings on “Happy Not Knowing,” and ambivalence comes to a head on “Right Words Wrong Time” as she cautions, “Don’t you tell me now that you’re ready for me.”\n\nShe also compensates for several uneventful and/or shallow tracks with a disarmingly sincere “Real Love,” her voice betraying genuine wariness and vulnerability as she sings, “I just don’t know who to trust sometimes.”\n\nUltimately, the release is modestly alluring enough to have you rooting for Jepsen, even if you aren’t dedicated to “Dedicated.” And if you aren’t, she has a message on album-closer “Party for One”: “If you don’t care about me, I’ll just dance with myself.”\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen\n\n\"Dedicated\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLucette, Sturgill Simpson intoxicate\n\nWhen Canadian singer-songwriter Lauren Gillis, aka Lucette, launched her debut “Black Is the Color” five years ago, her career path looked clear. The release was produced by Dave Cobb, who produced country-music breakouts Sturgill Simpson and Jason Isbell, and featured folk noir songs. Simpson even played the title character in the video for the single “Bobby Reid.”\n\nBut the Edmonton singer’s sophomore release, produced by Simpson, is a pivot for both of them.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” is a piano-and-electronica-steeped collection of quietly opulent, moody songs that sound like a cross-pollination of Lana Del Rey, Cowboy Junkies and Mazzy Star.\n\nIt’s both intoxicating and bare, and maybe not something you’d expect from neo-outlaw-country star Simpson. But consider: His singing persona and Lucette’s persona could be the quintessential star-crossed lovers, their lives intertwining in opposites-attract passion until the infatuation fades and the inevitable doom sets in.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” could chronicle such a relationship, Lucette flush with irrational love (a la classic girl-group delusion) in the exuberant swells of “Angel.” Before then, she pines about being a kept woman on the title track, dreams of companionship in the sax-spiked brooding waltz “Out of the Rain” and teases at the dangerous excitement that can be found in unexpected places on the synth-soaked “Full Moon Town.”\n\nPost-“Angel,” the throaty Lucette sees the inevitable cracks in her soul, meditating on escape in the gospel-flavored “Fly to Heaven,” hinting at running away in the stark, vocal-centric “California” and reaching an epiphany with “Crazy Bird”: “You’re in the sky, I’m on the ground.”\n\nThere are sobering traces of mental instability on the reverberating “Talk to Myself” before the release concludes with the desperate plea “Lover Don’t Give Up on Me,” where she sings, “When it’s gone, there’s nothing left but searching for the light.”\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” rates an extended stay.\n\nLucette\n\n\"Deluxe Hotel Room\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBudokan Boys play with 'Dad'\n\nMusic has long been used for eccentric purposes, and electronica has been a particularly fertile ground for whimsical musicians, from Kraftwerk and Yello to Daft Punk and Kanye West.\n\nThe Budokan Boys – instrumentalist/programmer Jeff T. Byrd and vocalist/lyricist Michael Jeffrey Lee – further establish themselves as part of this would-be sub-genre of electro-performance-artists with “Dad Is Bad,” a follow-up to the duo’s “That’s How You Become a Clown.”\n\n“Dad Is Bad’s” eight tracks are mostly stories with bizarre twists and unhappy endings for some of its characters, skittering across an onslaught of playful technology and presented by Lee in a variety of modulated vocals.\n\nListeners will feel mixed emotions when Lee’s cartoonish voice somersaults over the off-kilter beat and menacing drone of “Sick Pick” to reach the sobering conclusion, “Always post a picture so you don’t die alone/You don’t want to die alone.” Later, Lee lets his Southern accent fly on “My Old Friend,” which sounds like a lighthearted exploration of sexual identity until his “old friend” ends up dead by suicide.: “I thought maybe he was gay, maybe he wasn’t, but now he’s dead, end of discussion.”\n\nThe Budokan Boys also kick up a whirlwind of wobbly percussion to talk about random God sightings on “God Today,” stretch out a taut style of stripped-down exotica for “The Hermit” and unfurl the weirdly wry tale of a model prisoner who gave up his life “to save the warden’s son” on “The Prisoner.”\n\nThe songs of “Dad Is Bad,” which are all distinct from each other, don’t lend themselves to singing along and, while stirring, they don’t lend themselves to dancing along, either. Yet their unique charm will encourage repeated listens.\n\nSo when Lee employs a hybrid human/robot voice on the churning “Rent Me” to offer his wide-ranging services – “You should rent me, I’m cheap!” – you’ll already know you want to keep him around.\n\nBudokan Boys\n\n\"Dad Is Bad\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWords sometimes fail Antony Carle\n\nThe artistry behind Antony Carle’s new “The Moment” is fascinating: His elegantly ethereal voice weaves through a blend of classic chamber and pop music as well as thoroughly modern electronic soundscapes, the combination of which creates a mystical realm.\n\nHowever, the illusion is shaded by his slurry enunciation as he self-indulgently drops words into an aural blur – though to be fair, the lyrics that are clear are sometimes mundane, so perhaps he’s shielding his lines with deliberate obfuscation.\n\nRegardless, Carle’s moany/breathless delivery on “But You, Everybody Is” glides passionately above the soulful/New Age bliss, and the arrangement of “Icon” is as delicate and precise as a music box as Carle sings, “I got you on my mind – always … Big dreams on my mind – always.” Meanwhile, in the sophisticated EDM of “Save Face” he frets, “What will we do for money when it’s all gone?” and eventually hangs up in frantic repetitions of “When it’s all gone?!? When it’s all gone?!?”\n\nOne of the beauties of “The Moment” is that Carle takes risks, even if they don’t always pay off. For example, “Commitment” is a complicated cut anchored to an irregular beat as the singer rushes through lines with a talk/sing/rap flurry – “What is it going to take for you to grow up? … What do you take me for, do I look dumb to you?” – and the song becomes mired in nervous energy. Carle also takes the elevator up to the pulsing “Top Floor” and ultimately gets lost in an inconclusive end.\n\nYet even if Carle strays, his distinguishing characteristics consistently surface with compelling impact, such as when he contemplates transformation in the throbbing “Manifesto”: “For it to happen, I have to forget what I know.”\n\nAnd with only a slight mutation, his next release could be even more memorable than this.\n\nAntony Carle\n\n\"The Moment\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMehldau takes improbable path\n\nJazz pianist Brad Mehldau goes on a wild bender with his new “Finding Gabriel,” an unexpected mix of quaint synthesizers, classical music, New Age, performance art and Muzak.\n\nThose individual components of sound may seem entirely incompatible with each other, but the familiar pieces merge together into something improbably transformative.\n\nIn addition to working with his more traditional keyboards, Mehldau uses an analog synthesizer to create riffs and passages worthy of a 1970s B movie. To that he adds strings and horns suitable for an elegant wedding and wordless, angelic vocals that could work for a stately funeral or perhaps an elevator ride. And songs drift through passages that could serve as background for meditation one minute and a sophisticated party the next.\n\nMehldau also adds biblical-inspired themes, because why not?\n\nBreakbeat, drones, trumpet and layered vocals kick off “Finding Gabriel” with the protracted opening track, “The Garden,” before the release moves on to the oddly crunchy interlude “Born to Trouble,” the gurgling buzz of the cinematic “Striving After Wind” and the thickened brew of “O Ephraim” (which sounds like the descendant of an Ennio Morricone composition).\n\n“Finding Gabriel” also makes a strong finish with the liquid electronica of “Make It All Go Away,” the lush strings and irregular beat of “Deep Water” and the comparatively bustling chaos of “Proverb of Ashes.”\n\nSometimes Mehldau’s more theatrical turns on “Finding Gabriel” are both challenging and rewarding: “St Mark Is Howling in the City of Night” and the title track could be performance art for a cocktail lounge, for instance. But when Mehldau throws all subtleties out the window on the Trump-bashing “The Prophet Is a Fool,” he gets heavy-handed and cheesy to the point the album’s mystique is diluted.\n\nFortunately, he moves on and restores the illusion.\n\nBrad Mehldau\n\n\"Finding Gabriel\"\n\nRating: 4 (out 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCiara embraces 'Beauty Marks'\n\nCiara is a woman who got it together singing about getting it together on her new “Beauty Marks.”\n\nThe 33-year-old vocalist/model had a murky path to this clear-headed release. The Atlanta-based singer was still a teen in the mid-2000s when she rocketed to the front of the crunk/R&B movement with a quick string of hits such as “Goodies” and “1, 2 Step.” Then the hits faded, the sales slacked, and Ciara’s career took a backseat to her personal life – a public romance and breakup with Future followed by a public romance and marriage to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. And she had two children along the way.\n\n\"Beauty Marks,” her first release since 2015’s “Jackie,” finds Ciara comfortable in her skin, a middle-of-the-road performer who doesn’t stand out beyond her distinctly Janet-Jackson-like voice. The arrangements are modern but not pioneering, and fitfully clunky (“Set,” “Greatest Love”). Her lyrics are true yet familiar.\n\nCiara taps into the wobbly electronic throb of opener “I Love Myself,” singing “I’ve been to the bottom and I’ve seen the end” and expressing the epiphany that led to self-care (“I found the problem, and it starts with me”). Later, Kelly Rowland swings by for the playfully sleek woman-power anthem “Girl Gang,” and Ciara flexes her might in the brassy reverberations of the rewarding “Dose.”\n\nSexy songs balance the self-help mojo of “Beauty Marks” – Ciara battling urges in the catchy percolation of “Trust Myself,” flirting with Tekno in the playful throwaway “Freak Me” and embodying a 1980s-era Prince ingenue in the retro-fresh cool of “Thinkin Bout You,” where she tries to balance infatuation with caution.\n\nAnd naturally the release ends with the inevitable piano-and-strings title-track ballad, formulaic but well-executed. as she sighs, “Oh what a feeling to wake up every day, knowing I am loved by you.”\n\nPredictable, maybe, but it’s also reassuring.\n\nCiara\n\n\"Beauty Marks\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nA.A. Bondy's captivates with obscurity\n\nA.A. Bondy’s new “Enderness” is a subtly spellbinding listen that might catch listeners unawares.\n\nThe Alabama-native former alt-rocker (with the band Verbena) returns with his first solo singer-songwriter album in 8 years, switching from an acoustic-oriented foundation to an electronic-based sound that is vaguely indistinct and beautifully grim.\n\nWaves of ambient New Age drones and near-drones wash over the skeleton of a blues framework, creating a net result that conveys sad calmness. And Bondy’s dim view of the world, delivered in bleak and often spaced out vocals, is the finishing touch for an opioid-addled America. … There’s even a stark song about drug addiction, “Fentanyl Freddy.”\n\nYet though “Enderness” feels like that uncomfortable experience of being trapped in a drowsy limbo, unable to fall asleep or fully wake up, the trippy tone ultimately beguiles, beckoning the listener to surrender.\n\nBondy sings in social-media acronyms and broken thoughts in the meditative sprawl of opener “Diamond Skull,” hypnotizes with the ominous refrain of “I’ll never know every shape you can take” on “I’ll Never Know,” disappears in the soothing strains and scorched imagery of “#Lost Hills” and whispers in the muted, heartbeat pulses of “The Tree With the Lights.”\n\nElsewhere, instrumental tracks underscore the aura, from the brightening shimmer of “Pan Tran” to the lulling title-track closer, where the ebb and flow of long synthetic notes is nuanced by effects that facsimilate rolling waves … or distant thunder … or a far away, disintegrating glacier.\n\n“Enderless” is compellingly ambiguous, a new style of shoegaze music where what you see is too blurry to recognize.\n\nA.A. Bondy\n\n\"Enderness\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMemphis band never gives up\n\nSouthern Avenue further establishes its foothold as a roots-music band of the future with “Keep On,” the Memphis band’s follow-up to its 2017 self-titled debut.\n\nThe group breathes new life into a venerable, thoroughly American, blend of blues, R&B and gospel with two distinctive signatures – the rock finesse of Israeli guitarist Ori Naftaly and the passionate delivery of American soul singer Tierinni Jackson.\n\nSouthern Avenue is full speed ahead from the start of “Keep On,” dispensing the title track with a jazzy brew of horns and stomping beat and Tierinni Jackson’s belted earworm refrain: “You get what you put out.” From there the band continues to emanate an infectious glow, from Naftaly’s teasing guitar that supplies tension for “Whiskey Love” to the singer’s beckoning offer on the smoky “Savior” to “put it all in my hands, oh baby let me save ya” to the funk-anchored groove of “Switchup.”\n\nSouthern Avenue ultimately hits a few potholes as the journey wears on, with Tierinii Jackson forced to sell the indistinct arrangement of “The Tea I Sip,” for example, and with a filler atmosphere taking over other tracks such as the directionless “Too Good for You” and the low-energy “We’ve Got the Music.”\n\nYet “Keep On” keeps on coming back, with the sweet romance of “Lucky,” the fired-up tempo of “Jive” and the rock-opera-esque climax of “She Gets Me High.”\n\nNo lull ever creates a protracted drag on “Keep On,” and the band’s effervescent spirit is a constant – all the way to the simmering optimism of the feelgood finale, “We’re Gonna Make It.”\n\nIndeed, it does seem like they’re going to make it.\n\nSouthern Avenue\n\n\"Keep On\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Liberal rednecks' still stoke the fire\n\nThree years ago, Trae Crowder, Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester were knocking around Knoxville’s amateur comedy scene when an expletive-laden comic video rant by Crowder went viral on Facebook and beyond. Calling himself a liberal redneck, Crowder employed his authentic rural Tennessee accent to emphatically advocate for LGBTQ rights.\n\nThis was during the 2016 election campaign, and Crowder’s voice – which sounds like every stereotype of a close-minded bigot, though his perspective is on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum – caught fire as more viral videos followed. Crowder and his like-minded, similarly-accented comedy pals Morgan and Forrester have been on tour crisscrossing America together ever since, stoking their elevated visibility with national TV appearances, a collaborative book, a heightened social media presence and more.\n\nThe new audio release, “wellRED Live From Lexington,” finds the trio more frustrated than ever after two years of the Trump presidency and doubling down on their push for social equality while also poking fun at their own “good ol’ boy” upbringings and the internal conflicts they’ve had reconciling their affection for the South and their hate of bigotry.\n\nThe 90-plus minute “Live From Lexington” is broken into thirds, plus a short epilogue where the three jointly talked about a couple of hilarious shared experiences. The force-of-nature Forrester kicks off “Live” with an electric set, pitting his love for Chick-fil-A food against his disdain for the company’s support of anti-LGBTQ policy and then brushing on everything from pudding cups and Ramen noodles to North Georgia culture and illogical redneck arguments against gays in the military. Morgan follows with a gentler start, building a set about his church-based upbringing, sports and county fairs into an explosive bit about being high at a church Nativity ceremony.\n\nCrowder, who now lives in California, starts with a nod to Knoxville, saying he was unfazed to learn that in today’s political climate that WWE wrestler Kane was elected mayor of Knox County. He also takes down the arrogance and naivete of would-be enlightened Californians before he settles into brilliant tales about his poor upbringing and his gutsy-but-flawed “pillbilly” mother, stories even conservative rednecks could enjoy.\n\nThen Crowder, a married father of two, refocuses on family at the end by skewering parents who reject their gay kids: “It blows my mind that something like that could actually impact the way they feel about their child.”\n\nThis may be prickly humor – raw, raunchy and confrontational – but there’s a lot of heart at its core.\n\nTrae Crowder, Drew Morgan, Corey Ryan Forrester\n\n\"wellRED Live From Lexington\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCranberries meet sad 'End'\n\nThere was no right way for The Cranberries to produce a final album with their late singer Dolores O’Riordan, but doing nothing at all would have been the worst move.\n\nO’Riordan, who died in January 2018 after drowning in a bathtub while intoxicated, had recorded vocal demos for new material before her death. Her band – brothers Noel (guitar) and Mike (bass) Hogan plus drummer Fergal Lawler – built up songs around her recordings to create the new “In the End.”\n\nThose vocals are decidedly unpolished and tentative at times, obviously because O’Riordan expected to finesse the process with additional recordings, and her bandmates decided to just make do with what they had rather than put her voice through unseemly processing in the studio.\n\nThe result is an “In the End” that sounds halting, albeit genuine, familiar and incredibly sad.\n\nThe group that created such 1990s hits as “Zombie,” “Linger,” Dreams” and “Ridiculous Thoughts” echoes their past – jangly alt-rock and catchy refrains, though nothing with “Zombie”-level voltage.\n\nO’Riordan, who died at age 46, maintains the childlike wonder in her voice here, shading the wistful and grim songs with hints of hope.\n\nAnd given her demise, the lyrics turn out to be a gut punch: “I know that time is moving fast” she muses in the darkness of “Lost,” while on the delicate “Illusion” she sings, “It’s all an illusion/This is my conclusion for now.” Also, “In the End’s” title track is a slow and ghostly finale where O’Riordan sings, “Ain’t it strange when everything you wanted was nothing that you wanted in the end?”\n\nFans would have wanted more than this collection of semi-memorable soft songs, just as they would have wanted more of O’Riordan, period. But as the singer herself would likely say, you take what you can get and make the most of it.\n\nThe Cranberries\n\n\"In the End\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPink is pale on \"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nThis was supposed to be Pink’s moment. The April 26 release of her eighth studio album was planned to put her squarely in the spotlight. … Until Beyonce made the surprise release of “Homecoming: The Live Album,” Taylor Swift released the surprise single “ME!” and even Madonna came out of the woodwork to release the surprise single “Medellin.” What’s more, Lizzo came out of seemingly nowhere to top Amazon’s sales charts with the April 19 release of her bold new album, “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nNow Pink’s new “Hurts 2B Human” feels like an afterthought - and an overly familiar one at that, partly because four of the songs have already been released as singles, and partly because most of the other tracks sound like something Pink has done before.\n\nShe’s again working with an army of top-shelf collaborators (including Max Martin, Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Beck, Ryan Tedder and Sia) and top-shelf guest artists (including Khalid Chris Stapleton and Cash Cash).\n\nPlus she sings her guts out, tapping into her trademark themes such as perseverance, heartbreak and isolation. Songs like “Walk Me Home” and the title track are classic “you and me against the world” numbers that take on extra weight and poignancy as Pink prepares to turn 40 in September.\n\nAnd to contrast the morose air, she spins through the catchy kiss-off “Hustle” (which stylistically/thematically mirrors Elle King’s “Ex’s & Oh’s”) and settles into the heavily synthesized “90 Days” (which should prompt Imogen Heap to consult her lawyers for its similarity to her hit “Hide and Seek”).\n\nBut mostly Pink is down, sad about her “young emotions that just won’t grow up” on “My Attic” and self-pitying with the revelation “maybe I’m just scared to be happy” on “Happy.”\n\nIndividual tracks are beautiful, even touching, but overall “Hurts 2B Human” is déjà vu depression.\n\nPink\n\n\"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBeyonce's bloated without visuals\n\nBeyonce seized the rapt attention of the masses with this week's release of her new Netflix visual/aural feast “Homecoming Live,” which shows the conceptualization and execution of her performances at Coachella in 2018.\n\nThere’s also an audio-only companion piece, “Homecoming: The Live Album,” which is simply a mess.\n\nBeyonce is a force of nature on “Homecoming,” and she shares the spotlight with husband Jay-Z, daughter Blue Ivy, sister Solange, Destiny’s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, dancers, fans, a drumline, other musicians. … And all that sharing fractures the “Homecoming” album experience, which stretches over 40 frustrating tracks that, at a running time of one hour and 49 minutes, sound both rushed and addled.\n\nWithout the visual context, the album’s focus is pulled by meandering medleys, excessive interludes and abruptly truncated songs (“Hold Up” only gets 46 seconds) – a sometimes unlistenable chaos of distractions and commotion.\n\nFortunately, Beyonce takes command of several showstoppers, revving up for her solo breakout “Crazy in Love” followed by the raw power of “Freedom,” delivering a one-two punch with the fierce delivery of “Don’t Hurt Yourself” and the clap-along “I Care,” drumming up late-album excitement with a boisterous “Get Me Bodied,” a lively “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” and an inspired rendition of “Love on Top.”\n\nFor his part, Jay-Z is a powerful match for his wife in the duet “Déjà Vu,” plus the three-song Destiny’s Child reunion – for “Lose My Breath,” “Say My Name” and “Soldier” - is a gratifying throwback.\n\nMore reviews:Anderson .Paak, Khalid, Billie Eilish and more\n\n“Homecoming Live” could have been edited into an incredible 12-track release, but as is, it’s a bloated collection that doesn’t stand on its own apart from the film.\n\nSo if you want to hear a great Beyonce album, listen to “Lemonade” instead.\n\nBeyonce\n\n\"Homecoming: The Live Album\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBTS sticks to the plan\n\nBTS is the most popular modern version on the quintessential boy band: wildly successful with the most fervent fan demographic – adolescents – and review-proof.\n\nYet the group of seven guys also breaks ground as the most successful K-pop band in American history, singing and rapping mostly in Korean. They’re currently unstoppable, at least until the inevitable splintering of the band members, and their new “Map of the Soul: Persona” was a guaranteed smash before it was even released.\n\nBut should it be?\n\nJimin, RM, V, Jin, Jungkook, Suga and J-Hope range in age from 21 to 26, and they’re a nonthreatening bunch of solid vocalists, because as always with boy bands, we don’t want any edgy men in the group to scare parents away.\n\nAnd when BTS slides into its very familiar groove, “Map of the Soul: Persona” offers a serviceable mix of soft dance, melodic pop and scruffy hip-hop … well-trodden territory for BTS, who isn’t trying to pioneer a new sound.\n\nHowever, the release is a scant 7 tracks, including unspectacular (cheesily produced) opening and closing rap/rock songs “Intro: Persona” and “Dionysys.”\n\nThe remaining five cuts are mostly satisfying, particularly the smoothly infections single “Boy With Luv” (featuring Halsey in a minor guest role) and the chilled hip-hop of “Home,” which slyly teases with “You know I want that … You know you got that.” Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran had a hand in co-writing the soft-focus, horn-accented romance of “Make It Right,” and “Mikrokosmos” floats in timeless-pop ether (and never quite comes in for a landing). The lethally slow melodrama “Jamais Vu” is the only clunker here, though rest-assured it will be embraced by fans all the same.\n\nGiven the moderate artistic quality of “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it’s hard to argue that BTS deserves all of their current success. But it’s even harder to argue that they don’t deserve at least some of it.\n\nBTS\n\n\"Map of the Soul: Persona\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLively Lizzo lets loose\n\nBrace yourself: Lizzo’s new “Cuz I Love You” is a sensory-overload assault of extremely friendly fire, an infectious and empowering release that checks subtlety at the door.\n\nThe Houston-native singer/rapper (and dancer) had previously held back on belting (she told Entertainment Weekly “I didn’t want to be that big black girl with a soulful voice”), but holding back isn’t in her nature, so now she belts with the best of them on “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nThe new release overflows with self-love and empowerment as Lizzo adds an exclamation point to nearly every line she delivers. Bumping against the heated dance groove of the jovial “Juice,” she proclaims, “Ain’t my fault that I’m out here makin’ news/I’m the pudding in the proof/Gotta blame it on my juice,” and she even contemplates marrying herself on the sizzling “Soulmate”: “I’m my own soulmate, I know how to love me … I’m never lonely!”\n\nAnd on the ultimate girl-power anthem, the blustery “Like a Girl,” Lizzo opens with “Woke up feeling like I just might run for president!” (Don’t even try to hold her back.)\n\nMeanwhile, Lizzo’s not a one-note phenomenon: She also channels her charisma into relationship songs, taking audible breaths between lines on the bold title track - and implying a huge “duh!” when she bellows “I’m cryin’ ‘cause I love you!” She also sends away an unsuitable suitor on “Jerome,” suggesting he, “come back when you’re grown.” And Lizzo dramatically erupts in the over-the-top, choir-backed “Heaven Help Me,” letting loose with, “If love ain’t dead, I’m gonna kill it/’Cause it’s killing me.”\n\n“Cuz I Love You” features notable guest appearances from Missy Elliott (“Tempo”) and Gucci Mane (“Exactly How I Feel”), but otherwise this is all about Lizzo, down to her sensual “Lingerie,” where she closes out the release with a saucy come-on: “Hair down, moonlit, look at my lipstick.”\n\nEven if you don’t fall in lust with Lizzo, you’re likely to fall in love.\n\nLizzo\n\n\"Cuz I Love You\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMatt Simons seems to be an unflappable guy. He’s a genial singer-songwriter originally from California, but now based in Brooklyn. He’s got a deceptive “Everyman” air about him, relatable and generally easygoing.\n\nSimons breezes through the songs of his new “After the Landslide” like a contestant killing it on “The Voice.” He’s a crowd-pleaser, even if you can see (almost) every line coming a mile away, and he sings with an unassuming delivery tweaked with natural-born soul.\n\nHe sounds a lot like John Mayer, and that’s OK.\n\nOn “Summer With You,” Simons earnestly sings about “that summer with you,” reminiscing about looking at meteor showers at 3 a.m. in search of the meaning of life. He employs transparent reverse psychology on “Not Falling Apart,” lying his way through lines like, “You’re not the girl in every song I write … You were never the one for me … There’s not a freckle on your face that I’m missing.”\n\nSimons usually keeps it positive – tapping into an infectious sing-along on “Made It Out Alright,” offering encouragement and support on “Open Up,” grandly putting his heart on the line on the moving title track and then slyly showing his best Mayer-esque confidence on “If I Was Your Man.”\n\nHe sounds genuinely casual most of the time, be it in “We Can Do Better’s” brassy call for positivity or even in the bluesy “It’s You,” which only makes the point that he can sing blues if he must (though it’s not his forte).\n\nAnd when Simons takes a dark turn, he’s soberingly effective. On “Dust,” featuring Betty Who, he sternly warns a troublesome ex, “Don’t kick the dust up, just ’cause you’re lonely.” And on the hymnal-ish “Amy’s Song,” Simons deals a gut-punch to those who reject LGBTQ family and friends in the name of religion: “Does your god really give a damn? Does it make her less of a woman? Does it make him less of a man?”\n\nUltimately, Simons is comfortably familiar and routinely satisfying.\n\nMatt Simons\n\n\"After the Landslide\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMissyou's emotions are tough to hear\n\nMissyou’s “YourBody” sounds like the breakup album of Trent Reznor and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe alt-rock release is dark and electrified, with Missyou frontman Blaise Beyhan treading on grim sonic territory in the same realm as Reznor’s Nine Inch Nails, while thematically his bitter disappointment about a dysfunctional relationship aligns with Swift.\n\nExcept Beyhan isn’t shaking anything off. Instead of shrugging that “haters gonna hate,” he hangs up in the refrain “None of us are getting out alive” on the track “closetoyou.”\n\n“YourBody” is bleakly compelling like that, with Beyhan stewing in the emotional cauldron of betrayal and rage.\n\n“Are you with or against me now?” he demands in the stomping “Child 44” before seething about, “Using bullets like ‘I love you, but I’m not in love with you anymore’.” And fear and sensuality intertwine on the title track, a desolate song that sounds like ambient music for a funeral pierced by static and flashes of rock, while Beyhan issues something that feels more like a threat than an invitation: “Neither one of us is going to sleep tonight.”\n\nHowever, the threat level drops on this dense melodrama as Beyhan gets so twisted in his passion that the songs can’t breathe.\n\nThe mopey “Anything” is raw at first – “What happened to me and you? What happened to telling the truth?” – and then Beyhan’s unmitigated pain collapses into “Would’ve done anything for you.” Meanwhile, his obsessions ultimately force “Timid & Timbuktu” to get lost in space, and the unchecked nervous energy of the self-indulgent “Know It All” results in an uncomfortable listening experience.\n\nTo be fair, it isn’t realistic to wrap feelings of anger and pain in tidy three- and four-minute packages. It’s harder than that to move on from hurt, as difficult as that is to hear.\n\nMissyou\n\n\"YourBody\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nIcelandic-Canadian singer is universal\n\nLindy Vopnfjord is from a small and very specific community that many may never have heard of – he’s an Icelandic-Canadian from Manitoba – but his music couldn’t be more universal.\n\nVopnfjord, who now lives in Toronto, gets in touch with those Icelandic roots on his new “You Will Know When It’s Right,” a collaboration with the Icelandic band Nydonsk recorded in Reykjavik. The release also includes a live version of Vopnfjord’s song “Lover Sister,” performed with Nydonsk at Reykjavik’s Eldborg Harpa concert hall.\n\nThe first few notes of opening cut “Love Me Like That” show that Vopnfjord could be from anywhere; the track’s jangly flow and well-branded refrain are trademarks of folk-pop-rock songs around the world.\n\nThe nostalgia of “You Will Know It’s Right” is broadly relatable, and Vopnfjord does hint at his background at times, as on the full-bodied “Standing on the Sea” where he wistfully sings, “The nights are cold here, cold as hell,” and adds, “It’s a nice place to visit, but you wouldn’t want to stay.” However, there’s a distinctly American/country-music twist to ‘How Did We Get Away,” a bittersweet reflection on lost friendship.\n\nBeatles said it’s all you need.” And though there are clear Beatles influences in Vopnfjord’s melodies, his voice is more akin to Rod Stewart, distinctively raspy and endearing.\n\nHe also charms with his call for understanding and togetherness. On the quirky ballad “I’m So Hi,” he sings, “Speak your mind across party lines if you’ve got something to say.” And on the more romantic “Our Greatest Irony,” he offers, “It could be I’m just right for you, even if I’m against you.”\n\nThere’s some sameness to the tracks that slows the flow of the low-key “You Will Know When It’s Right.” But the audience’s warm auction to the live rendition of “Lover Sister” provides a comforting finale.\n\nLindy Vopnfjord\n\n\"You Will Know When It's Right\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/19"}]}

Maybe not? – take their talents from Hegenberger Road to Dean Martin Drive come 2027.\n\nFor the moment, it’s instructive to follow the tenses.\n\nFollow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules\n\nA’s president Dave Kaval is speaking in the past tense about Oakland and the present about Vegas. Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred, who has served as Fisher’s reluctant hatchet man as needed, says his office supports the A’s “turning their focus on Las Vegas” and “bringing finality” to the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo has one eye on the multi-billion dollar legislative pie fight that still awaits, saying that an A’s move “would be” great news for his state and they’ll “continue to navigate this opportunity.”\n\nNaturally, 49 acres of desert land is useless without plumbing and electricity. And that may very well prove to be the force that drives the A’s from Oakland: Infrastructure.\n\nThe club and the city of Oakland have navigated a Byzantine series of approvals and environmental impact reports to bring Fisher’s dream of a $12 billion real estate project that includes a ballpark closer to reality. But the Howard Terminal project was dealt a key setback in January when the city of Oakland was denied a $182 million federal grant from the Department of Transportation, a huge chunk of the nearly $600 million estimate needed for infrastructure.\n\nThe city had cobbled together more than $300 million through proverbial loose change beneath various funding couches, hopeful not to pass the costs on to the taxpayer. Yet as inflation rose and city and team failed to strike a deal, the original infrastructure cost nearly doubled, with the city already expected to create a special tax district containing Fisher’s 3,000 homes, hotel and other commercial opportunities.\n\nAnd this is where Oakland draws the line where other municipalities might merely capitulate to the franchise owner.\n\nFisher, worth an estimated $2.4 billion, could simply bridge that gap in funding, or at least make a good faith effort to close it. Yet that’s anathema to owners and their leagues, who wince when reaching into their pockets for a new stadium when public money will do. They’d rather stick up a municipality than set a precedent by writing their own check, even in California, where Manfred has acknowledged political processes \"are their own sort of animal\" compared to stadium efforts in other cities and states.\n\nTranslation: Oakland is not Nashville.\n\nPerhaps you’ve missed it, but the NFL’s Tennessee Titans are just one city council vote from winning approval for a $2.1 billion stadium – a price tag that includes $1.26 billion in public funds. Go ahead and calculate what that might pay for the public across the decades; instead, it’ll see eight annual football games, an occasional Final Four or Super Bowl and perhaps a Morgan Wallen concert or three, all for a project even the conservative Nashville area narrowly opposes.\n\nOakland lost the stomach for such giveaways decades ago, when a $600 million deal for the Raiders went bad almost immediately. Al and Mark Davis reaped the benefits on the front and back end of the deal, the latter moving the team to Las Vegas even as the public still faced $55 million to pay off bonds from the 1995 move. Just for kicks, public officials allowed the team to avoid repayment on loans totaling $64 million, a cost that with interest grew to $189 million.\n\nIt was a disastrous deal in 1995 and the state of play is even worse now, with a full-blown regional housing crisis atop the enduring challenges of poverty, income inequality and funding shortfalls facing the city. Nonetheless, Fisher quickly adopted a “waterfront condos or bust” mentality, getting Manfred to play along by calling the Coliseum site inappropriate for a new facility, even if approval and construction would’ve been a relative breeze.\n\nPerhaps this was Fisher’s game all along: Las Vegas, unless Oakland capitulates. The issue had been framed in opposite terms up to now, until Kaval spoke of “parallel paths” in Oakland and Vegas and the grim intonations from Manfred came more frequently.\n\nAnd even still, there remains no deal. It’s easy to forget that in May 2022, Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder caused a brief stir when he obtained the rights to purchase land in a particularly dank and inaccessible corner of the capital region. A year later, and Snyder soon won’t own the team, let alone develop a new stadium.\n\nA’s fans would surely appreciate a similar outcome. Fisher has been a passive at best and malignant at worst steward of the franchise, which he took over after Lew Wolff sold his controlling interest in 2016. While the A’s have been lauded for their plucky and overachieving ways, it’s easy to forget the innovative Beane joined the organization in 1990, and current GM David Forst about a decade later; under Fisher, the club’s good young players only get traded sooner and sooner, the on-field product growing uglier.\n\nKaval’s early tenure as club president briefly inspired hope, through vague platitudes on social media and the workshopping of myriad new stadium ideas at the aging Coliseum – a “treehouse” for in-game fun, creative ticket packaging and experiential visions for the ‘Gram.\n\nThe A’s used to lean into their rough-hewn fan base, even dubbing the experience “Green Collar Baseball” for a while. Yet in retrospect, a 35,000-seat waterfront stadium, at Bay Area prices, likely would have excluded many of those drum-pounding fanatics on most nights, anyway.\n\nYears later, Kaval has ghosted the fan base, as the Coliseum falls further into disrepair. The myriad “lol Coliseum” moments over the years – be it sewage, feral cats or possums – technically fall under the purview of the Joint Powers Authority, which operates the yard. Yet owners can always pour a little TLC into a facility, if they care.\n\nThe A’s stopped caring about Oakland a few years ago, their Vegas gambit practically a nod to franchise history that saw them move from Philadelphia to Kansas City to the Bay Area, surviving there even through the penurious Charles O. Finley years, an expected move to Denver and a football-driven ruination of a once-pleasant ballpark.\n\nThis time, it was what the city perceived to be moving goalposts. City council president Nikki Fortunato Bas said Oakland worked to overcome hurdles \"every time the A's put a new problem in front of us,\" and that it's unfair \"to the fans and our residents to string us along in this manner.\"\n\nManfred is fond of saying that deadlines drive action and that's probably the case here, too. The 2022 collective bargaining agreement mandated that the A's strike a deal for a new stadium - in any city - by Jan. 15, 2024, or the club would once again be weaned off MLB's revenue-sharing plan.\n\nHitting Fisher in the wallet is certainly one way to end the inertia.\n\nNow, Las Vegas, where the club hopes to play by 2027. We’re past the point of wondering whether a sports franchise can make it in the desert, not after Raiders Nation followed them there, the Golden Knights made the Stanley Cup Finals and the NCAA and several conferences are making it the de facto capital of college basketball.\n\nEighty-one home dates, largely during the worst tourist periods of the year, will be a different challenge. The bigger one may come from Fisher, whose inelegant leadership in Oakland suggests a theme Las Vegas’ politicians and citizens might want to adopt as this “parallel path” gets cleared.\n\nBuyer beware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/13/mussel-eco-tourism-morgan-freeman-firework-fix-news-around-states/111419498/", "title": "Mussel eco-tourism, Morgan Freeman: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Senate on Tuesday delayed a vote on increased protections for Confederate monuments after an African American lawmaker threatened a filibuster and said the memorials celebrate a time when African Americans were enslaved and lynched. Senators began debate on a bill that would increase the penalties for violating the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act from a flat $25,000 to $5,000 per day. State Sen. Rodger Smitherman, an African American legislator from Birmingham, brought a thick rope on to the floor of the Alabama Senate, as he said the monuments commemorate a time of racial terror, including lynching. “This is 2020. When are we as a state going to get past this stuff? Please, tell me,” Smitherman said. “I tell (people) Alabama has changed, and then we do this kind of stuff.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials with the world’s most famous sled dog race announced Thursday that they have postponed post-race events in Nome in response to the new coronavirus. The Iditarod has postponed both the awards banquet set for March 22 and the meet-the-mushers event set for March 21, both in Nome, where the winner is expected some time next week. Nome City Manager Glenn Steckman said the race will continue, but officials are also encouraging people to employ appropriate social distancing and telling anyone who’s feeling ill or over 60 years old not to attend the event afterward. Meanwhile, the leader is taking a day’s rest at the halfway point of the race. Brent Sass, a native of Minnesota living near the Alaska community of Eureka, was the first musher to the checkpoint in Cripple, the Iditarod’s halfway point.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A Pima County sheriff’s deputy seen on video tackling a teenage quadruple amputee at a group home last year will not face charges, prosecutors said. The Pima County Attorney’s Office could not prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Deputy Manuel Van Santen’s use of force on a 15-year-old boy was unnecessary, Nicol Green, the office’s chief trial counsel, said in a letter Tuesday. Deputies went to the group home in September after a worker called 911 to report the teen had knocked over a trash can and made verbal threats. Another teen used his cellphone to film part of Van Santen’s interaction with the boy, who has no arms or legs. In the footage, the deputy tussles on the kitchen floor with the boy, who is screaming and cursing. The deputy then uses his body to pin the teen on his side. After about two minutes, the officer gets up and talks to the teen, telling him to “shut the hell up.” The boy is then arrested on disorderly conduct charges. The boy did not suffer any physical injuries, according to his attorney, Samuel Jurgena.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state House speaker has been elected chairman of the state Highway Commission following the death of the panel’s previous leader. The commission on Monday elected Robert Moore as chairman, replacing previous Chairman Tom Schueck, who died last week at the age of 78. Moore was appointed to the commission by then-Gov. Mike Beebe in 2013 and had been serving as the commission’s vice chairman. His term on the commission expires in January 2023. Moore served three terms in the Arkansas House and was speaker during the 2011 legislative session. Commissioner Dalton A. Farmer Jr. was elected the commission’s vice chairman. He was appointed to the panel by Gov. Asa Hutchinson in January 2015, and his term expires January 2025.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom has issued sweeping, statewide “guidance” in response to the coronavirus pandemic, asking Californians to postpone all nonessential gatherings through the end of March, including even small social gatherings in places where people can’t remain at least 6 feet apart. The California Department of Public Health advisory issued shortly before midnight Wednesday also says gatherings of 250 people or more should be postponed or canceled, and gatherings of people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people. “Not holding that concert or community event can have cascading effects – saving dozens of lives and preserving critical health care resources that your family may need a month from now,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Campaigners for a new state license plate option hope to honor victims of a theater shooting. The campaign by nonprofit organization Aurora Rise needs 3,000 signatures to start the process of obtaining state approval for the license plate, The Aurora Sentinel reports. The organization was established following the July 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora. James Holmes killed 12 people and wounded numerous others inside the theater. The license plate would raise funds to benefit the state’s Victim Compensation Fund. The fund receives money from fines collected as a result of felony, misdemeanor and some traffic offenses. Taxpayer dollars do not supplement the fund. A draft design of the license plate shows a blue ribbon signifying victim’s rights and the phrase “We Rise.” The draft also features 13 stars in the sky, which the organization said represent the 12 people and one unborn child who were victims.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gun rights supporters are suing state officials over part of a 2013 gun control law passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, saying it unconstitutionally bans people from loading more than 10 rounds of ammunition into their firearms. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court cites the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the ability of people to better defend themselves with more bullets in their guns. The defense league, the Second Amendment Foundation and two Connecticut gun owners filed the lawsuit against Public Safety Commissioner James Rovella, state police Col. Stavros Mellekas and Chief State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo Jr., none of whom were in their current jobs when the gun control law was passed. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that states can regulate firearms to protect public safety, said state Attorney General William Tong, whose office will defend state officials and the law.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The governor signed a bill into law Wednesday that limits how long pet owners can keep their dogs tied up outside and specifies the conditions in which they must be kept during severe weather events. The Senate bill signed by Gov. John Carney in Wilmington makes it illegal for dog owners to tether the animals or leave them unattended outside for more than two hours when nobody is home, or nine consecutive hours in a day when somebody is, The Delaware State News reports. The bill specifies that dogs can’t be left outside unattended at any time when the National Weather Service has issued a weather advisory or warning. The bill also mandates that between Nov. 1 and March 31, or when temperatures drop below 35 degrees, dogs must be housed in spaces that are raised off the ground, are wind- and waterproof, are capable of preserving heat and contain a flap over the entrance.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency Wednesday as the number of identified coronavirus cases in the nation’s capital reached 10, and officials recommended gatherings of 1,000 or more people be postponed or canceled. The announcement signals a major escalation in the District of Columbia’s response to the spread of the virus. Bowser declared both a state of emergency and a public health emergency. The declarations give her the authority to order medical quarantines, request federal assistance and take steps to stem price gouging on critical supplies. The city has leased a building as a potential quarantine facility. Officials declined to disclose the location and said the facility, which will be able to a house about 50 people, is not being used yet. Organizers of the popular Cherry Blossom festival, which was scheduled to begin March 20 and traditionally attracts throngs of visitors to the nation’s capital, announced that several events would be postponed.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state is on the verge of ending firework sales that are done with a wink and a nod under a bill the Legislature passed Wednesday. One of Florida’s least enforced laws bans fireworks sales unless people are buying them to scare birds away from farms and fisheries. Customers sign a form saying that’s how they intend to use fireworks. Businesses from fireworks mega-stores to stands that pop up ahead of holidays don’t ask any further questions. The bill going to Gov. Ron DeSantis would make fireworks legal for use on the Fourth of July, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Lawmakers have said the current law makes no sense and forces Floridians to lie to buy fireworks. The bill passed on an 82-34 vote.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Business leaders postponed the city’s 196-year-old St. Patrick’s Day parade Wednesday amid concerns about the new coronavirus hours after Gov. Brian Kemp took the extraordinary step of asking state lawmakers to approve $100 million in additional funding to help the state combat the virus. Meanwhile, Georgia’s caseload of people with COVID-19 reached 31, with one death. Started by Irish immigrants to Georgia’s oldest city in 1824, the March 17 parade has ballooned into a massive street party that’s Savannah’s most profitable tourism draw. Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council released a brief statement saying the annual celebration had been “postponed to a later date not yet determined.” The group added: “No businesses are asked to close.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A bill in the state Senate would earmark $4 million to buy land in a Maui watershed for conservation. The Na Wai Eha watershed in the West Maui Mountains is being sold in pieces by the Wailuku Water Company, Hawaii Public Radio reports. The watershed provides about 70% of Maui’s drinking water. The proposal would require matching funds from Maui County, which has considered a purchase for years, but county officials have been unable to reach an agreement. The appraised value of the land was about $11 million two years ago. Democratic Rep. Troy Hashimoto, who represents the Na Wai Eha region, said more than 4,000 acres of watershed land have already been sold to private owners. “The future of our drinking water is within that watershed, so we need to protect that,” Hashimoto said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A popular local music festival has been postponed until September amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Treefort Music Fest attracts crowds of more than 20,000 people each spring. This year more than 400 artists and bands were in the lineup for the weeklong festival originally scheduled to begin March 25. Treefort organizers made the announcement Wednesday. Idaho has not had any confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, but nearby states have seen growing community spread. Other major music festivals across the country have made similar decisions. Treefort officials said all tickets purchased for the March event will be valid for September, and customers can request refunds by emailing the festival.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Lawyers for a short-order cook shot by police trying to arrest him for using a subway train’s gangway doors filed a lawsuit Wednesday alleging officers used excessive force in violation of policies laid out in court-monitored police reforms. Neither officer seeking to detain 33-year-old Ariel Roman – whose Feb. 28 shooting in a busy subway station was captured in bystander video widely viewed online – was properly trained before their deployment as part of a city bid to reduce violent crime on Chicago Transit Authority lines, according to the filing in U.S. District Court. The 12-page suit says the city hired the officer who shot Roman knowing she had been arrested in 2015 for assaulting a fast-food restaurant worker. And it says her partner should have intervened to stop her but instead could be heard telling her, “Shoot him!”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State agencies are not allowed to use an “X” gender designation on identification documents for residents who don’t identify as male or female, the state attorney general said. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill Jr. said in an official opinion this week that agencies must have strict direction from the Legislature to adopt the nonbinary identifier, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Republican Sen. Jim Tomes requested Hill’s opinion. State law requires applications for driver’s licenses or state IDs to include information about the person’s gender. Hill, a Republican, said the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and State Department of Health exceeded their authority when they briefly allowed nonbinary individuals to apply for a driver’s license, state identification card or birth certificate with an “X” marker. An attorney general’s opinion is not legally binding.\n\nIowa\n\nMuscatine: A diverse group of local citizens wants to save a nearly 115-year-old pump house and use it to help restore the population of Mississippi River mussels that was decimated during the last century to manufacture pearl buttons. The group, called the Mussels of Muscatine, hopes to build an eco-tourism attraction that’s grounded in mussel research and propagation – reversing the legacy of overharvesting the mollusks, now highly valued for their water-cleansing abilities. “We could turn this around and learn from history. It could be a springboard for clean-water initiatives,” said Terry Eagle, director of the National Pearl Button Museum at the History & Industry Center in Muscatine, once the center of the mussel trade. Fishermen harvested mussels from the Mississippi River for decades, beginning in the late 1800s. Muscatine companies were producing 1.5 billion pearl buttons a year from mussel shells by 1905, accounting for nearly 40% of the world’s button production.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Wednesday named an attorney who said he’s similar in temperament to former Chief Justice Lawton Nuss to replace Nuss as a Kansas Supreme Court justice. K.J. Wall, of Lawrence, also formerly worked for the state’s highest court overseeing special projects and research for justices in death penalty cases. He was most recently a partner in a law firm that represents rural Kansas hospitals. Kelly cited what she described as his wide-ranging background in picking Wall over a Kansas Court of Appeals judge and a veteran prosecutor who now works for Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Wall, 49, grew up in Scott City in western Kansas, where his father operated a hardware store, and was a national champion debater at Kansas State University. He will join a seven-member court that for years has faced strong criticism from conservative Republican legislators over rulings on school funding, the death penalty and abortion.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s auditor called for greater transparency on use of state aircraft by elected officials as he reported that most flights taken by the former governor lacked documentation on their purpose. Most of those flights were on aircraft operated by Kentucky State Police, and under state law the purpose of those flights doesn’t have to be documented, state Auditor Mike Harmon said Thursday. Harmon’s report stems from a review of the use of state aircraft by former Gov. Matt Bevin and former Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton between January 2016 and September 2019. The Republicans left office in December. Only 16 of 309 flights billed to the governor’s office during that time had their purpose documented, Harmon said. Bevin’s use of the state aircraft came under media scrutiny during last year’s campaign, when he was unseated by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Land bought for a Taiwan company’s planned $9.4 billion plastics complex may hold as many as seven slave cemeteries – five more than previously thought, local activists said Wednesday. A 146-page report from Coastal Environments Inc. says the 2,500-acre site holds five previously unknown areas that archaeologists concluded may hold the graves of slaves, in addition to two mapped in the late 1800s. A community group called Rise St. James sent a letter about the report Wednesday to St. James Parish Council members in hopes of convincing them to revoke permits for the Formosa Plastics Group member called FG LA LLC, said founder Sharon Lavigne. She and five members of her group were later able to visit one of the sites marked on the old map, but it took about an hour and intervention by sheriff’s deputies before a guard let them through the gate, she said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Children will have swifter access to dental care under a proposal approved by the Legislature. The Maine Senate on Tuesday enacted the proposal from Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn that would prohibit insurance plans from implementing waiting periods before they will cover tooth decay treatment in children. Sanborn said one insurer, Northeast Delta Dental, has announced it would eliminate the waiting periods for children covered in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont beginning Jan. 1, 2021. Maine’s bill would be the first in the country to prohibit such waiting periods for children, Maine Democrats said. The bill has been sent to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who can sign it, veto it or let it become law without signature.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A worker operating a trash loading machine rescued a severely injured dog after the animal fell 30 feet into a garbage incinerator. The front-end loader operator noticed something moving among the piles of debris, stopped his machine and jumped into the trash to save what turned out to be a critically injured dog, Baltimore Animal Rescue & Care Shelter said in a statement Wednesday. The dog was taken to the shelter, where veterinarians found he was covered in trash, unable to walk, and suffering from multiple cuts and puncture wounds, according to Animal Rescue. The center named him Donut, and he has since been recovering, Bailey Deacon, a spokeswoman for the shelter, told The Baltimore Sun. Donut remains under emergency care and could require surgery on both of his legs, animal rescue said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Workers at the largest power plant in the state who went on strike last weekend are back on the job after reaching a tentative deal Wednesday with the plant’s owner, their union said. Dozens of employees at Mystic Generating Station in Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood started a strike Saturday over what they called concerns about safety and working conditions. The 2,001-megawatt, oil- and natural gas-fired plant’s owner, Exelon Generation, has repeatedly cut corners and deferred important maintenance upgrades, according to the Utility Workers Union of America Local 369. The agreement led to new protections and improved working conditions, union President Craig Pinkham said in a statement. Workers are expected to ratify the new agreement, the union said. Exelon confirmed the agreement but said the dispute was not about safety.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Thursday approved $312 million in spending to provide financial assistance for adults age 25 and older to attend community college and partially revive the state’s tourism campaign. The supplemental bills won bipartisan approval from the Senate two days after clearing the House. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will sign the legislation after the House concurs with minor changes. Some of the money will partly restore funding the Democrat vetoed last fall amid a budget impasse with the Republican-led Legislature over fixing roads. Lawmakers waited to pass $9 million in additional education funding, to give themselves flexibility to use the bill as a way to quickly add more money to fight the coronavirus, for which they earmarked $25 million.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz proposed Thursday to bank $1.2 billion of the state’s projected $1.5 billion budget surplus because of the uncertainties about how the new coronavirus will affect the economy. Citing “a rapidly unfolding need,” Walz said at a news conference that his one-page proposal ensures that Minnesota will be in as strong a fiscal position as any state in the country while providing enough flexibility to respond to the pandemic. The “triage” work that went into the plan means “many worthy causes” are left unfunded, he said. “There are priorities that are absolutely critical to me that aren’t in here – things that I have spent my whole career trying to advocate for, but now is not the time to do that,” he said. The Democratic governor’s proposed supplemental budget would add only $256 million in new spending on programs to the $48 billion two-year budget that the Legislature approved last year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State officials have scrambled to edit a public service announcement about the 2020 U.S. census that led viewers to an incorrect website. The Census Bureau notified Mississippi officials Monday with their concerns that the ad could confuse people on what they should expect in the mail. In the 30-second spot, actor Morgan Freeman holds a postcard with a QR code. “It’s one of the most important things you’ll ever find in your mailbox,” he says, before urging residents to fill out their census forms so Mississippi can unlock federal funds that are dispersed based on census results. Starting this week, the Census Bureau is mailing out initial notices inviting people to participate in the census. The notices aren’t postcards, though; they are blue, letter-length papers that don’t feature QR codes, images that can be scanned with a smartphone to take someone to a website. Mississippi officials say the mistake was an honest one, and the ad has been edited to make the QR code unreadable. Freeman, an Academy Award-winning actor, has owned businesses and lived in the Mississippi Delta.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A police officer who pleaded guilty to accidentally killing a female colleague while playing a variation of Russian roulette said the woman knew the risk she was taking. Nathaniel Hendren made the response Wednesday in a wrongful death lawsuit that was filed on behalf of the mother of Katlyn Alix, 24, who also was a St. Louis officer, KSDK reports. Hendren is serving a seven-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter for killing Alix at his home in January 2019 while he was supposed to be on duty elsewhere. Also named in the lawsuit is Hendren’s partner on the force, who also was at the home while on duty. Alix was off-duty at the time. In the response, Hendren admitted to acting recklessly on the night of Alix’s death. But his attorney, Talmage Newton, said Alix assumed risk by voluntarily participating in the game. Hendren also said he and Alix were involved in a romantic relationship.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana and the Native American Rights Fund are challenging a state law that they say severely restricts Native Americans’ ability to vote. The groups filed a lawsuit in District Court in Billings on Thursday arguing a voter-approved referendum that restricts who can collect ballots, as well as how many they can return to county election offices, disproportionately burdens Native Americans who live in rural areas without home mail service. The Ballot Interference Prevention Act “ignores the everyday realities that face Native American communities,” said Jacqueline De Leon of the Native American Rights Fund. “It is not reasonable to expect voters to drive an hour to drop off their ballot, so collecting ballots in reservation communities just makes sense.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state moved a step closer Wednesday to creating a new commission focused on African American affairs, similar to existing groups that represent Latino Americans and Native Americans. The measure won first-round approval in the Legislature on a 32-0 vote. The new, 14-member commission would meet quarterly and be allowed to hire an executive director. Commission members would receive $50 a day while performing commission duties, plus expense reimbursement. The bill by Sen. Justin Wayne, of Omaha, would also require the commission to work with the Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs and the Commission on Latino Americans to conduct a study on disparities in government contracting every two years, starting in 2022. Two additional votes are required before the bill goes to the governor.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two men have been indicted on charges of vandalizing an archaeological site after U.S. prosecutors say the pair spray-painted rock formations in a national monument that features petroglyphs – and were caught soon after while still covered in blue paint. Daniel Plata and Jonathan Pavon, both 25 and from Elko, are charged with conspiracy, destruction of government property, and unauthorized damage or alteration or defacement of archaeological resources, U.S. Attorney Nicholas Trutanich’s office said. Prosecutors say the men “went on a vandalism spree” while on their way to a wedding in September 2019, where they stopped at three different locations on a remote Nevada road and filmed themselves using spray paint to vandalize buildings with their nicknames “Velor” and “Cluer.” The men then drove into the White River Narrows Archaeological District within Basin and Range National Monument. The winding canyon is home to one of the largest concentrations of prehistoric rock art in eastern Nevada, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAuburn: A 77-acre property on Lake Massabesic has been conserved through efforts of the Manchester Water Works and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. The property provides a forested buffer to the lake. The wooded property and nearly 5 acres of wetlands serve to trap nutrients and sediment running off Route 28 from draining into the lake. Much of it supports Appalachian oak-pine forest and hemlock-beech-oak-pine forest. Lake Massabesic is the surface water drinking source for over 165,000 residents in Manchester and surrounding communities. “Providing clean, high-quality drinking water is a primary goal for the city,” Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said in a statement. “By preserving our natural resources and guaranteeing this land will not be developed, Manchester Water Works and the Forest Society are ensuring our water quality will remain pristine for future generations.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRiver Vale: A convenience store owner reacting to the coronavirus outbreak created and sold a spray sanitizer that left four children with burns, state and county law enforcement officials said. Authorities on Tuesday issued a summons charging Manisha Bharade, 47, of Wood-Ridge, with endangering the welfare of children and deceptive business practices. State consumer officials also opened an investigation into the sale and promotion of health and sanitation products at her 7-Eleven store in River Vale. Bharade mixed commercially available foaming sanitizer, which wasn’t meant for resale, with water and packaged the bottles in her store, authorities said. “An apparent chemical reaction from the mixture caused the burns” to the three 10-year-olds and an 11-year-old, authorities said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The University of New Mexico has announced it will offer free tuition for first-time students whose families make $50,000 or less. The Lobo First-Year Promise scholarship program was announced Thursday and is available to the Albuquerque campus’ incoming freshmen class. University officials estimate up to 1,500 students are eligible for the program, which could cost the university more than $9 million, based on current tuition and fees, officials said. The scholarship will cover tuition and fees not covered by other scholarships, grants and financial aid, university officials said. The university capped qualifying household income at $50,000, about the state median income. The free tuition is aimed at “students who may not have thought a university education was possible next year,” said Dan Garcia, university vice president of enrollment management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gatherings with more than 500 people will temporarily be banned in the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday when announcing one of several “dramatic actions” to contain the coronavirus. He said the ban would start for most places at 5 p.m. Friday, though it does not apply to schools, hospitals, nursing homes and mass transit. The ban for Broadway theaters began at 5 p.m. Thursday and is in effect through April 12, according to a statement from The Broadway League, an organization of theater owners and producers. The ban comes as some of New York City’s most esteemed cultural institutions announced Thursday that they are temporarily shutting down because of the coronavirus, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Some 20 years after a proposed NASCAR track on Chestnut Mountain in Haywood County ran out of gas, the forested, mountainous land outside Canton is now looking to attract the more environmentally friendly sports of hiking and mountain biking. And it’s expecting just as much interest, visitors and economic impact as fast cars. A grant of $150,000 to protect 448 acres and 9 miles of stream, about 20 minutes west of Asheville, was one of four major land protection grants announced Wednesday by Attorney General Josh Stein, speaking at the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy offices in North Asheville. The four Environmental Enhancement Grants total nearly $500,000 for projects in Western North Carolina to protect water quality, wildlife habitat, trout streams and rare mountain bogs and to create public parks for more outdoor recreation opportunities closer to town centers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials are focusing their efforts on protecting elderly residents and those with chronic conditions after a man in his 60s became the first person in the state to test positive for the coronavirus, Gov. Doug Burgum said Thursday. Health officials said the Ward County man traveled to the East Coast and had contact with a person who also tested positive for the disease. He has isolated himself at home, and his symptoms appear to be mild. Officials are working to identify people who may have been in close contact with him. Burgum said he wants people to make decisions “on facts, not fear,” and urged residents to take two main precautions: wash their hands with “good old soap and water,” and stay home when they’re sick. “We even like the phrase ‘North Dakota tough,’ ” Burgum said. “Right now ‘North Dakota tough’ means making the right decisions about protecting yourselves, your family, your friends and your co-workers. There has been a culture in our state that if you’re ill, you’re the strong one if you still get up and go to work.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Local officials representing nearly 85% of the state’s residents have agreed to a plan to share any money brought in from settlements with companies over the toll of opioids. Gov. Mike DeWine and Attorney General Dave Yost, both Republicans, announced acceptance of the plan on Wednesday. They said that the communities who have agreed to the plan cover 9.8 million of the state’s 11.7 million residents. While some local and county governments did not vote, none voted against the plan, the officials said. Part of the plan is that Ohio and its local subdivisions would negotiate for settlements jointly. No other state has announced a similar plan. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies are facing about 3,000 lawsuits in the U.S. over the toll of opioids. Combined, prescription painkillers and illicit versions such as heroin and fentanyl have been linked to more than 430,000 deaths in the country since 2000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Senate voted Wednesday to increase penalties for drug possession near schools, drawing criticism from proponents of a state question in 2016 that made such crimes misdemeanors. The Senate voted 35-12 for legislation to make it a felony to possess methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine or fentanyl within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school. The bill would not apply to people under 18, those enrolled as a student at a school or people found in possession during routine traffic stops. The bill’s passage upset proponents of State Question 780, a citizen-led initiative in 2016 that reduced the penalties for drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor. Oklahoma voters approved the state question with more than 58% of the vote after the state’s incarceration rate had become one of the nation’s highest. The bill now heads to the House for consideration.\n\nOregon\n\nDetroit: The process for visiting Marion Lake, a beloved alpine pool in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, has always fairly simple, but beginning this summer, that experience will change in a big way. From May 22 to Sept. 25, recreationists will need a special permit purchased in advance, from a limited number available, to camp or even day-hike to Marion Lake and a host of other familiar backcountry spots in three wilderness areas between Salem and Bend. The limited-entry permit system, finalized this month by the U.S. Forest Service, is intended to limit increasing crowds from trashing the Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters and Mount Washington wilderness areas. But it will also make planning a trip to anywhere in 450,000 acres of Oregon’s most iconic backcountry more challenging. As the first block of permits go on sale April 7, Forest Service officials are preparing for a summer in uncharted waters.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPalmyra: Family members of several people buried at Gravel Hill Cemetery were blindsided last week after cemetery staff removed items that had been placed at their loved ones’ gravesites for years. Gravel Hill cleans away items from gravesites twice a year, removing dead flowers, wreaths and other “non-permanent” items. This year, however, mementos that had been at a grave for more than 10 years were removed, and in one case, statues that were glued to a headstone were removed. Betsy Shelly, whose son, Michael, was buried at Gravel Hill in 2005, said the family glued a tiny statue of a dog that had belonged to her son to his headstone. A similar statue that had become unglued and an angel figurine were also placed next to the headstone. When her husband went to visit Michael’s grave late last week, they were all gone. A cemetery official said miscommunication – combined with an effort to be more thorough in this spring’s cleaning – led to the situation.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state-appointed superintendent of the city’s school system released a list of priorities Wednesday that he intends to tackle in an attempt to turn the struggling district around. The plan unveiled by Superintendent Harrison Peters, who started Feb. 20, is not the final state turnaround plan that is expected to be released next month but the initial steps. The 10-page plan includes reviews of every school in the district; a review of the district transportation policy; the establishment of a task force to “significantly reduce” employee vacancies; a recruitment campaign to attract “diverse and effective” teachers; and a plan to gather and track the social-emotional health and growth data of students. The state took control of the city’s school system Nov. 1 in response to a scathing report by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy last June that called the system among the nation’s worst.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Amid a flurry of cancellations of college classes, athletic events and St. Patrick’s Day parades in the state over the coronavirus outbreak, one institution plans to keep going – the state Senate. Senate President Harvey Peeler gaveled out the chamber for the week Thursday and told senators to be back at 2 p.m. Tuesday. “I’m no human health expert. But I’m a human nature expert,” the Republican from Gaffney said. “We tell people to ‘stay calm, don’t worry, things are going to be fine’ and then start closing things, there’s a mixed message.” The South Carolina House is not meeting next week, but that was a planned break after the chamber finished its work on the state budget. Gov. Henry McMaster has asked the General Assembly to release $45 million to state health officials as soon as possible to fight the virus.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A state lawmaker was being tested for COVID-19 on Thursday as the Legislature met for one of its final days of the session. Rep. Spencer Gosch, a Glenham Republican, was feeling ill and decided to get tested Thursday morning, House Speaker Steve Haugaard said. Gosch is avoiding contact with other people as a precaution. Gosch said he had a cough that matched the symptoms of COVID-19 but was also being tested for other possible illnesses. The Legislature didn’t immediately alter its schedule or routines. Lawmakers were trying to complete a budget by Thursday, which was the final work day aside from a day at the end of the month reserved for wrapping up business and responding to vetoes.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee would no longer be required by law to sign a proclamation that names a day each year after a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader, according to legislation passed by the state House on Thursday. The unopposed vote in the Republican-led Legislature moves action to the Senate on the bill that targets Nathan Bedford Forrest. The Republican governor pushed the legislation, which initially sought to remove Nathan Bedford Forrest Day as a day of special observance. House lawmakers amended the bill to keep the day in state law but remove the requirement that the governor sign off on proclamations for special days of observance. Lawmakers did not mention Forrest during brief floor discussion Thursday.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, has been canceled about halfway through its run as a precaution against the new coronavirus, city and county officials said Wednesday. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said they would be issuing emergency health declarations to slow the spread of COVID-19. Rodeo organizers said the event grounds were closing Wednesday afternoon, and they were working on a ticket refund process. “This is a decision that does not come easily, but the health and safety of people in our region is paramount,” Turner said. Officials said they made the decision after news Tuesday of a positive case in nearby Montgomery County that indicated community spread was happening, when a person contracts an illness from an unknown source.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Changes to a voter-approved law aimed at curbing gerrymandering passed the Legislature on Wednesday. The plan now before Gov. Gary Herbert comes after supporters of the 2018 initiative agreed to a compromise to revise the measure. It creates an independent redistricting commission in hopes of reducing gerrymandering, a process of manipulating voting districts unfairly to gain an advantage. The bill drops requirements that the GOP-dominated Legislature take an up-or-down vote on redistricting maps developed by the bipartisan commission and provide a formal explanation if it chooses not to adopt them. Lawmakers have contended that would infringe on their constitutional powers. The new legislation would also repeal a requirement to use a statistical “partisan symmetry” test to ensure districts do not unduly favor any political party. Critics called that unclear and subjective.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Mayors from the Green Mountain State have made the case for changes to policy on a series of key issues plaguing the state, including affordable housing, climate change and substance abuse. Members of the Vermont Mayors Coalition were present Tuesday at a conference at the State House, the Times Argus reports. The coalition was formed in 2013 and includes mayors from eight of the state’s cities. Six mayors must concur on any recommendation for the VMC to take a position. The group asked lawmakers to increase weatherization programs to tackle climate change as well as advocate for a 2% local options tax for commercial cannabis that would fund after-school and community programs for youth to reduce substance abuse.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A police captain, a former first lady of Virginia and a nun are among the women who will be honored during a luncheon to mark Women’s History Month. “Strong Voices: Celebrating the Power and Stories of Richmond Women” will be hosted by the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Monday. The event is being held to honor women whose vision and commitment have served Richmond and Virginia. The Times-Dispatch reports that participants will share personal reflections on how they persevered, how they were inspired and how they are extending the path for the next generations of women. The list of speakers includes Faith Flippo, a Richmond police captain; Sister Vicky Segura, a physician and pioneer in local hospice medicine; Adele Johnson, executive director of the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Virginia; and Anne Holton, a lawyer and former state secretary of education who served as first lady from 2006 to 2010 during U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine’s term as governor. The luncheon will be held at the Omni Richmond Hotel.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city may soon get the green light to install automated traffic cameras to ticket drivers who block crosswalks and use bus-only lanes. The Legislature approved a bill this week to allow the cameras for limited new uses, The Seattle Times reports. Blocking crosswalks and bus lanes is already illegal, but Seattle police say enforcing those rules is difficult during commuting hours because there’s often nowhere for cars to pull over. “Downtown Seattle is the most congested place in our state,” said Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, who sponsored the bill. “If we are going to protect safety, both of drivers and pedestrians, as well as the mobility of people relying on transit … we need the ability to enforce our existing traffic safety laws.” The bill would allow a pilot program for the cameras to operate through mid-2023.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Anyone interested in applying to become a West Virginia Natural Resources police officer can take a physical agility test and written exam next month. Applicants can take the physical test at 9 a.m. April 3 or 4 at the South Charleston Community Center. The written exam will be given after the physical test, at approximately 12:30 p.m. each day. That test will be administered at division headquarters in South Charleston, the agency said in a news release. Interviews for successful applicants will be held April 14 to 16. Applicants must have graduated from an accredited four-year college or university, with preference given to majors in natural sciences, law enforcement, criminology or criminal justice. Previous employment as a West Virginia-certified law enforcement officer may be substituted under certain circumstances.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers declared a public health emergency, the state Capitol closed to formal tours and the state high school athletics association moved to drastically limit attendance at remaining winter tournaments Thursday as officials scrambled to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus in Wisconsin. Evers’ declaration frees up resources and allows the Department of Health Services to buy, store and distribute medications regardless of health coverage. It also releases state funds to support local health departments with costs stemming from isolations and quarantines, authorizes the use of the Wisconsin National Guard and prohibits price gouging. DHS Secretary Andrea Palm said during a news conference that the agency is recommending the cancellation of all events with more than 250 people. Evers said people should stop shaking hands to prevent the spread of the virus. “ ‘Wisconsin nice’ is going to have to have a different look to it in the future,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State regulators will begin planning in the weeks ahead to consider rate changes proposed by the state’s largest electric utility. Rocky Mountain Power seeks to cut rates for industrial customers by 0.8%. The PacifiCorp subsidiary also proposes to raise residential rates by about $3.69 per month for the average customer. The Wyoming Public Service Commission will likely set a schedule in the next few weeks for considering the changes, Rocky Mountain Power spokesman Spencer Hall said Wednesday. The rates could take effect by next January. The changes would cover projects including wind turbine replacement at the Foote Creek I wind project near Arlington. Rocky Mountain Power has been investing in projects for five years without raising rates. Those rates are 10% below the Wyoming average and 34% below the national average, according to the company, which has about 146,000 customers in Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/13"}]}

They also sought Sean Hannity’s deposition last week, and Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo is scheduled to appear for a deposition next week, according to court filings.\n\nEach of the hosts are specifically mentioned in Dominion’s complaint against the network.\n\nThe depositions come as Dominion works to gather evidence that supports its case that the network defamed the company by spreading lies about fraud in the 2020 election that hurt Dominion’s business. It’s unclear what the Fox News personalities who have sat with Dominion lawyers said or were questioned about during their depositions.\n\nDominion has alleged the network “recklessly disregarded the truth” and participated in a disinformation campaign against it because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.”\n\nFox News has contested such claims and said it was “proud” of its 2020 election coverage.\n\n“We are confident we will prevail as freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected,” a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement about the depositions.\n\nThe network added, “In addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooted in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs.”\n\nA spokesperson for Dominion did not immediately have a comment.\n\nLast December, a Delaware judge denied Fox News’ motion to dismiss Dominion’s lawsuit.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, then-President Donald Trump falsely asserted that the election had been rigged against him. His allies promoted outlandish conspiracy theories about Dominion to support Trump’s false claims.\n\n“Fox took a small flame” of disinformation and “turned it into a forest fire,” Dominion said in its lawsuit.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion’s lawsuit added. “Fox sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process. If this case does not rise to the level of defamation by a broadcaster, then nothing does.”\n\nDominion is one of two election technology companies to have sued Fox News.

Dominion sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021, claiming the network knowingly broadcast lies being perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his attorneys as he clung to power in the months after his 2020 election loss.\n\nThe Denver-based voting technology company said the lies caused more than $1 billion in damage and led to its employees receiving threats.\n\nLast month, presiding Judge Eric Davis ruled that it was \"crystal\" clear that allegations broadcast by Fox News and claiming that Dominion's technology was responsible for fraudulently flipping the election were false. That left it up to a jury to decide whether Fox News knew those allegations were false, which triggers legal liability.\n\n“Money is accountability and we got that today from Fox,” said Dominion lawyer Stephen Shackelford after news of the settlement.\n\nWhat was at stake in Dominion v. Fox\n\nThe settlement came hours before trial testimony that was expected to feature a parade of high-profile Fox News personalities and leaders, including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Rupert Murdoch and former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nFox had denied all wrongdoing, saying this lawsuit is an attack on the First Amendment. The legal team also argued its hosts were covering an important news story. During pretrial hearings, the legal team had taken hits – including the judge sanctioning them and telling them they had a “credibility problem.”\n\nEXPLAINER:The Fox News defamation trial begins in Delaware. Here's what you need to know\n\nThe outcome could have had major implications for misinformation and freedom of the press.\n\nLeading up to the trial, some legal experts remarked how strong of a case Dominion had. It’s uncommon for defamation cases to make it to trial and even rarer for a plaintiff to prove actual malice.\n\nDominion would have needed to prove to a Delaware jury that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing that the claims were not true.\n\nFox lawyers did not answer reporters' questions following the news of the settlement. The network, in a statement, said they \"acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\n\n\"We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nWHAT’S AHEAD:The Dominion defamation lawsuit is over. But Fox still has legal fights\n\nHow the trial ended before it began\n\nThe settlement came hours after the court completed selecting a jury and minutes before attorneys were to deliver their opening statements after a lunch break Tuesday.\n\nBut the jury was never brought into the courtroom, and those arguments never happened.\n\nInstead, the judge never took the bench. Over the subsequent three-hour delay, attorneys came and went from the backroom as a small army of media reporters speculated what was the cause of the delay. Eventually, Davis, the judge, reentered the courtroom, summoned the jury and announced the case had been settled.\n\nHe thanked jurors for their service and attorneys for their work.\n\nWhile the settlement avoids what was expected to be a six-week trial proceeding, it comes after years of litigation that featured a steady drip of embarrassing revelations derived from depositions, as well as evidence that included text messages and emails sent by Fox News personalities and leadership.\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks. Davis rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case and sanctioned its legal team for withholding evidence, including recordings of a former Fox producer that involved Trump associates.\n\nAnd there are still more lawsuits pending.\n\nDominion has sued One American News Network and Newsmax. Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, all Trump associates, have been slapped with defamation lawsuits. Fox is also facing a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, a voting machine company, that has made similar allegations to Dominion’s.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/04/21/dan-bongino-leaving-fox-news-after-failed-contract-negotiations/11711484002/", "title": "Dan Bongino leaving Fox News after failed contract negotiations", "text": "Fox News host Dan Bongino is leaving the network after the conservative commentator said he and the outlet could not come to terms on a new contract.\n\n“Folks, regretfully, last week was my last show on Fox News,” Bongino said Thursday on his podcast. “It’s tough.

At the conclusion of this six-week trial, 12 Delawareans will decide the outcome of one of the highest-profile defamation lawsuits in decades.\n\nThe trial was originally set to begin Monday morning, but the judge announced late Sunday night that it was being pushed to Tuesday. While Judge Eric Davis did not give a reason for the delay, media outlets reported that settlement talks are ongoing on Monday.\n\nSettlement:Fox News, Dominion reach $787.5M settlement just before defamation trial was set to begin\n\n“I can't think of another one that has been as consequential in recent history,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It clearly ranks as one of the most important, partly because of who the players are.”\n\nNo need for on-air apology\n\nNew York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg claims Fox News does not have to apologize on air to Dominion as part of the settlement agreement.\n\nFox News statement\n\nFox News issued a statement saying they were \"pleased to have reached a settlement\" in their two-year \"dispute\" with Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nThe three-paragraph statement also said they \"acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"\n\n$787.5 million settlement\n\nWhile Dominion Voting Systems was looking for a $1.6 billion in damages, they received just under half of that according to their lawyers.\n\n\"The truth matters,\" Dominion Lawyer Justin Nelson said outside the courthouse Tuesday after a settlement was announced. \"Lies have consequences.\"\n\nThe settlement means the Delaware jurors selected for this case will not get to hear testimony from many high-profile Fox News personalities and executives, including Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.\n\nSettlement reached before opening arguments began\n\nTwo hours after Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News was to start came word that the parties had settled their dispute.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nJudge in the room\n\nMore than two hours after opening statements were set to start, Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has entered the courtroom. But not before speculation grew as reporters waited for word of what has been stalling the start of Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nOpening statements were supposed to start at 1:30 p.m., but no word from Davis on what’s causing the delay.\n\nReporters have been tweeting how unusual it is for a judge to not tell the courtroom what's going on. Some are even writing about it.\n\nBritain’s The Independent is calling the delay a “mystery” in its heading.\n\nReuters is reporting that a reason has not been provided for the delays, “but two sources previously told Reuters that Fox and Dominion had been holding last-minute settlement talks.”\n\nThe New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg is reporting the courtroom scene as “it is sweltering, everyone is up from their seats, going in and out of the room. Fox’s lead lawyer, Dan Webb, has taken several phone calls. Some people are standing, all are talking, others gesticulating. It's relative anarchy for Judge Davis’s court.”\n\nHe also said legal experts in the room told him “this delay is a highly unusual development just minutes before opening statements were set to begin.”\n\nJudge authorizes special master\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks — and according to ABC News, it looks like they were handed another ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled opening statements.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis had already rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case, ruling in favor of Dominion that the claims Fox aired about the company were indeed false.

Davis last week reprimanded Fox’s lawyers, telling them they have a “credibility problem” and questioned if he could trust what they told him.

Photography is not allowed in Delaware courtrooms.\n\nThe person is a \"party,\" the judge said, but he did not give more detail.\n\nWashington Post media critic Erik Wemple said Caley Cronin, a public relations representative for Fox News, was summoned from Davis' courtroom and directed to the overflow room for having taken a photograph in the courtroom.\n\nThe photo was deleted from the person's phone, Davis said.

Here's why\n\nThe trial is expected to last six weeks.\n\nWhat's happening outside the courthouse\n\nA school bus filled with children drove past the courthouse. The children, who looked elementary or middle school-aged, yelled out the window at all the media lined up outside the courthouse. The kids laughed and stuck their tongues out, clearly excited about the commotion.\n\nWill Kenkel, a local, stood outside the Wilmington courthouse with a sign that read “Tucker Carlson, ditch the fascistic, stick w/ fish sticks.\"\n\nKenkel, who made the sign himself, said the slogan was prompted by his wife, who couldn't tell if he was saying \"fascistic\" or \"fish sticks.\"\n\nWhile Kenkel didn't mention Carlson's family fortune, the TV host's father married the heiress to Swanson frozen foods when Carlson was 10. The frozen food empire is well known for its fish sticks.\n\nKenkel said he was a little bit worried Monday when they delayed the trial, joking that if they settled, his knee pain from making the sign was going to be for naught.\n\nHe added that he plans to protest throughout the weeks-long trial.\n\nMore:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Tuesday\n\n“I’ve just been dismayed for a long time about all the mistruths and selective coverage on Fox,” he said. “There’s just some sense of justice after finally getting called out on it and taken to court, and hopefully made to pay for their broadcasting known falsehoods.”\n\nA third protester showed up around 9 a.m., wearing a shirt that said Make America Kind Again. He held a small sign that said, in all capital letters, \"Fox + GOP = fascist propaganda.\"\n\nObjections to opening statements\n\nThe final part of jury selection has officially started.\n\nJust before, lawyers for each side indicated they have objections to each other's opening statement slides. Fox lawyer Dan Webb said Dominion is \"objecting to huge amounts\" and that it would \"cripple\" their argument.\n\nFox has also objected to a significant portion of Dominion's presentation, he said.\n\nFinal stage of jury selection kicks off Tuesday\n\nThe final stages of jury selection started at 9 a.m., with opening statements starting shortly after.\n\nThese 12 Delaware jurors will have to decide if Fox committed “actual malice,” or the idea that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing the claims were not true.\n\nLast week, Delaware Superior Court summoned more than 1,000 people, who were asked a series of questions about their media consumption and if they worked at polling places, among others.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Monday\n\nIn the course of the upcoming six weeks, a dozen jurors will hear the evidence with 12 alternates, who will fill in if jurors have to drop out due to sickness or other circumstances.\n\nWaiting for the trial to start\n\nReporters began lining up outside of a Leonard L. Williams Justice Center courtroom before 7 a.m. when the room opened an hour later.Reporters have two options to watch the trial: They can watch from the courtroom or via a livestream in a neighboring courtroom – both on the seventh floor.\n\nOutside the Wilmington courthouse, media largely swarmed the area. But one man held a handmade sign saying, “Make Them Pay” and “Fox is guilty.”\n\nThe man appeared to focus on a group of well-dressed people, though it’s unclear what their role in the trial is. One man in a suit and two women stood in the group chatting. As the news cameras gathered around them to take a photo of the protester, they would move.\n\nMobile billboards\n\nTwo mobile billboard trucks trolling Fox News have been circling the area near Wilmington’s Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, where the Fox News defamation trial is scheduled to start.\n\nThe mobile billboards, commissioned by left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters for America, have messages reading “Fox News Lied,” “Lachlan Murdoch Knew,” “Rupert Murdoch Knew,” “Tucker Carlson Knew,” “They All Knew,” “FoxKnew.com”\n\nThe billboards highlight that Fox News knew the election fraud claims Trump’s team was pushing in 2020 were lies and promoted them anyway, according to a statement by Media Matters for America. The billboards specifically call out Fox Corp.'s chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who are scheduled to testify at the trial.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., the trucks moved from their spot on King Street and began driving down the road, turning onto Fourth Street as they circled the courthouse. As they drove by a DART bus stop, one man looked at them and smiled, saying “wow, wow.”\n\n“That’s wild, isn't it?” he said.\n\nWhat to expect at the trial and what's at stake\n\nDozens of journalists are expected to flock to Delaware to cover the trial. This case will also likely be one of the most significant trials The First State has ever hosted. Judge Eric Davis has prohibited any use of cameras in the courtroom or publishing audio recordings.\n\nDominion filed a lawsuit against Fox in 2021 after the cable news network aired false claims about Dominion, specifically that it helped rig the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJurors will have the task of determining if Fox committed “actual malice,” or the idea that it knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing that the claims were not true.\n\nDominion claims Fox knowingly spread falsehoods to pander to its conservative base of customers.\n\nFox has denied all wrongdoing, saying its hosts were covering the most important news story of the day. Fox News released a statement days before trial that described the lawsuit to be a “political crusade in search of a financial windfall.”\n\nMany Fox hosts are expected to testify during the course of the trial, including Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. It’s expected that Fox chairman and media mogul Rupert Murdoch will also testify.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT:Fox News sanctioned by Delaware judge for withholding evidence in $1.6B defamation trial", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/24/tucker-carlson-fox-news-departure/11728157002/", "title": "Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News in wake of Dominion Voting ...", "text": "Fox News' Tucker Carlson will no longer host his high-profile talk show.

With the trial expected to start Tuesday in Delaware, that doesn't appear to be happening.\n\nDominion has Fox News in a vise\n\nFox News’ reputation has taken a beating from just the pretrial court documents released to the public, which showed, via electronic messages and quotes from depositions, that executives and hosts sure seemed to know that the claims against Dominion were baseless. The network could prevail in the case, but even if it does, imagine what weeks of trial coverage featuring testimony from blunt instruments like Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity might do.\n\nAnd if Fox News loses, it could be on the hook for the $1.6 billion Dominion is seeking.\n\nDonald Trump desperately wants Fox News to keep lying\n\nSo the smart move would be to settle, even if the trial begins without a settlement, right?\n\nPerhaps in a parallel universe that doesn’t have a Donald Trump. But in this one, Fox News executives have the former president screaming in their ears via a Truth Social post Monday: “IF FOX WOULD FINALLY ADMIT THAT THERE WAS LARGE SCALE CHEATING & IRREGULARITIES IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THEM, & FOR AMERICA, THE CASE AGAINST THEM, WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED AT ALL, WOULD BE GREATLY WEAKENED. BACK UP THOSE PATRIOTS AT FOX INSTEAD OF THROWING THEM UNDER THE BUS - & THEY ARE RIGHT! THERE IS SOOO MUCH PROOF, LIKE MASS BALLOT STUFFING CAUGHT ON GOVERNMENT CAMERAS, FBI COLLUDING WITH TWITTER & FACEBOOK, STATE LEGISLATURES NOT USED, etc.”\n\nThis seems like a good time to mention the person who wrote that all-caps string of paranoid nonsense is presently the front-runner for the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination. But I digress.\n\nI would feel bad for Fox News if I didn't think they deserve every bit of this\n\nWith the Trump threat and the trial beginning, I might feel bad for the folks at Fox News if I didn’t hold them responsible for driving millions of Americans down faux-culture-war and conspiracy rabbit holes from which they’ll never emerge. (For more on that, ask the uncle you stopped talking to in 2016.)\n\nThe network has been a mouthpiece for the GOP for so long, the party line leads you straight into Fox News' studios. From fearmongering about former President Barack Obama's religion to fluffing Trump's ego throughout his presidency, the network would need a shot of epinephrine if it were ever exposed to objectivity.\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say to Fox News is: You’re facing an impossible situation of your own making and there’s no good way out. LOL!\n\nFox News could, you know, start telling the truth\n\nEven if the trial begins, a settlement is still possible if Dominion's lawyers start mopping the floor with Fox News' lack of credibility.\n\nBut at the end of the day, there are no good outcomes for a network that, as long as I can remember, has allowed people to lie on air without consequence. It has been a theater for the maliciously absurd, and it has damaged our society.\n\nI hope Fox News officials have to admit they peddled harmful, rotten, opportunistic bunk. I hope they see the light and start broadcasting the truth, then in turn lose their entire audience.\n\nAt the same time, I hope they don’t settle and get dragged for eternity by Trump and his MAGA minions, the very monsters they created.\n\nAll these options are fine with me and, I’d guess, many Americans who have spent years decrying the network’s dishonesty.\n\nAny consequence is a welcome consequence.

Supporting former President Donald Trump and parroting his lies about the 2020 election being rigged was good for the bottom line, so the network and hosts like Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson responded in kind.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Carlson was saying of Trump in text messages: “I hate him passionately.”\n\nThis puts Fox News viewers in a bind.

Next to each item, write down who you want to blame for those things.\n\nStep 2: Apply ample hair gel and style your hair as professionally as possible.\n\nStep 3: Sit down in the chair, look into the mirror and angrily read the things you wrote on the notepad to yourself.\n\nRepeat this process approximately 20 times a day and you will have successfully replicated Fox News.\n\nStart watching and reading actual news\n\nLOL!

Martin Quezada, D-Glendale.\n\n“I do appreciate that back and forth, and that’s why I’d want to be on it,” she said. “We could argue the whole time.”\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Ugenti-Rita gushed that her fellow senators “made it a delight to be here. I don’t want to leave this place, this microphone, because it’s over.”\n\nSen. David Livingston, R-Peoria, said he was looking forward to having “fun” in the House next year with Sen. Lupe Contreras, D-Phoenix.\n\nContreras also spoke with visible emotion about his experience in the Senate since 2015, (he was also in the House from 2013-14), saying it’s been a “hella great eight years here.”\n\nHe spoke briefly about the security alert because of the protesters. He said the tears in his eyes were out of anger, because his wife and children were in the building and he was “scared to all hell” for them.\n\n“What I had to endure today wasn’t cool,” he said.\n\nFann, who’s been a House or Senate member since 2011 and has worked in politics for 25 years, wiped tears from her eyes as she spoke of her peers.\n\n“We have seen you get married, we have seen you have babies… We’ve had a couple that we’ve lost,” she said. “You guys are amazing.”\n\nWith that, at 12:22 a.m., she ended the session to a round of applause.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n12:15 a.m. Saturday: 'Critical race theory' bill resurfaces in final minutes\n\nA much-debated “critical race theory” bill was resurrected in the final hours of the session. It bars schools from offering any curriculum, lessons or guest speakers who promote one race or ethnic group as superior to another and sets out penalties for teachers and schools who are found to have violated those guidelines.\n\nThe bill, now Senate Bill 1412, passed on a 16-10 vote. But it didn't get the final vote it needed to move to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk.\n\nIt echoed similar bills introduced this year in statehouses across the nation as Republicans tried to capitalize on what they called a “woke culture” that emphasized racial division over racial harmony. Democrats, in Arizona and elsewhere, said the bill itself is divisive and could accelerate a teacher exodus.\n\nSen. Victoria Steele, D-Tucson, said the legislation could block instruction on some of American’s darkest chapters, leading to an inability to learn from history.\n\n“It’s important that our history be told without any editing,” she said. “There are a lot of things that have happened to my Native American ancestors that I would like us to never have to live through again, like genocide and boarding schools. So I ask you, why is it important to put a gag order on the history of the United States?”\n\nSen. J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, said the bill has been wrongly demonized and is intended to ensure students get a straightforward presentation of key educational topics.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n11:20 p.m.: House ends its work\n\nThe Arizona House of Representatives has ended its session for the year after a tumultuous night briefly interrupted by protests close by and after passing a major piece of legislation that will allocate $1.4 billion toward water issues in the Grand Canyon State.\n\nMinutes after the vote, as lawmakers began taking selfies, Rep. Travis Grantham, R-Gilbert, offered a lighthearted apology to his colleagues for a tense few days of work that kept lawmakers up late and low on sleep. As speaker pro tempore, Grantham leads the chamber through its work.\n\n“If I offended you, too bad,” Grantham joked. “I’ll see some of you back here next year.”\n\nAs is tradition, lawmakers ended the session with speeches on the floor about their accomplishments, and they displayed short memories, forgetting the partisan battles that got them there.\n\n“At the end of the day, we all wanted the same thing,\" said Rep. Walt Blackman, R-Snowflake. Blackman will not return to the chamber next year as he’s running for a seat in Congress. “A state that our kids and families could grow up in and have the opportunities that we have. It is such a privilege to be here representing the people back home, and fighting the good fight with you.”\n\nHouse Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, in his distinctly measured, humorous and grandfatherly style, closed the session thanking his colleagues, House staff and the governor’s legislative team.\n\nBowers is running for a seat in the state Senate next year.\n\nThe fourth-generation Arizonan offered an ode to the state.\n\n“All across the state there is enormous value in the people, the diversity, the education, the experience,” Bowers said. “There is nothing that we can’t do — I include with faith in God, but that’s not requisite for every belief — when we respect each other, when we endeavor with our true and best selves to serve each other and our country. … What a marvel it is to be part of the tapestry of Arizona.”\n\nHe officially declared the House in recess until the Senate finished its business.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, I'd invite you to go on home,\" Bowers said to House members who gave him a standing ovation. First, however, Bowers hit the green carpet of the House chamber — removing his tie — for a quick pushup contest to wrap the session.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n11 p.m.: Lawmakers pass Ducey's water bill, add conservation funds\n\nArizona lawmakers on Friday night fulfilled Gov. Doug Ducey’s request for a $1 billion program to shore up the state’s water supply, passing legislation in the session’s waning moments.\n\nThe measure, which passed the House 48-1 and the Senate 25-1, budgeted a third of the money for the coming budget year, with the rest to come over the next two years. The addition of water conservation funds ultimately pushed the total higher.\n\nDucey originally proposed a new state authority to dole out money for projects such as water desalination in Mexico in exchange for Colorado River flows, water reuse within the state or in collaboration with neighboring states, or other new sources.\n\nThe Legislature altered that program to use the existing Water Infrastructure Finance Authority, and to include water conservation projects as well.\n\n“Arizona is putting our money where our mouth is” to protect the state’s people and economy from shortage, said Rep. Gail Griffin, R-Hereford.\n\nThe debate ran into the final night of the session, as Democrats, whose votes Republicans needed, insisted that the program include a meaningful investment in water conservation now, instead of only major infrastructure projects that could take a decade or longer to address water insecurity.\n\nAn amendment creating a conservation fund to support everything from turf grass removal to groundwater recharge ultimately passed, and Sen. Lisa Otondo, D-Yuma, said it would pay out $200 million.\n\nArizona Water Resources Director Tom Buschatzke had urged lawmakers to approve the legislation.\n\nBesides desalination, the money could help with projects such as a water recycling partnership that his department is exploring with a Southern California water provider.\n\nRep. Andres Cano, D-Tucson, had opposed the legislation in committee but ultimately supported it because of what he called “historic dollars” for water conservation.\n\n—Brandon Loomis\n\n10:30 p.m.: Voucher bill goes to governor\n\nA 16-11 vote in the Senate creates the first universal school voucher bill in the nation, expanding the state's Empowerment Scholarship Account program to all 1.1 million Arizona schoolchildren.\n\nThe approval of House Bill 2853 came after procedural disagreement earlier in the day, when Senate President Karen Fann took the bill straight to a final vote, skipping over the normal step at which lawmakers can debate a bill and propose amendments.\n\nThe bill passed the House earlier this week and is expected to be signed by Gov. Doug Ducey, who has long been a proponent of wider school choice.\n\nThe program provides 90% of the money the state would otherwise spend to educate a child in a public school to a scholarship that can be used for private school tuition, homeschooling expenses or other education-related expenses.\n\nThe average scholarship is $7,000, leading critics to say it will benefit primarily wealthy families who can already afford private-school tuition. They fear the money won't be enough for lower-income families to afford private school rates.\n\nDemocrats protested the procedural workaround and the intent of the bill.\n\nSen. Christine Marsh, D-Phoenix, said the bill is a ploy to defund public education, arguing there is not enough in Arizona's education budget to fund two systems: a public school system and a private system funded by taxpayer dollars.\n\nSen. Sean Bowie, D-Phoenix, amplified that point. The state budget, he said, is projected to have only a $14 million cushion in a few years and predicted the expansion of vouchers could quickly eat up that surplus.\n\nBut Republicans said the bill is a win for school choice and argued parents should be free to send their children to whichever school or education option that is best for them.\n\nSen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, pointed to research that shows students who have benefited from vouchers have posted higher college enrollment rates.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n8:40 p.m.: Senate calls recess, cites security threat\n\nSenate President Karen Fann abruptly called a recess to Senate work and evacuated lawmakers and staff to the Senate basement after protesters attending a rally after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade pounded on Senate windows and doors.\n\nTear gas was deployed at the protesters.\n\n\"We have a security threat outside,\" Fann said, trying to hurry along a handful of public-school supporters who had unfurled a banner expressing their disgust with the Senate's approval of universal vouchers.\n\nPeople soon returned to the Senate chambers on the second floor of the building and milled around a bit, then moved to a first-floor hearing room where the air was not so irritating.\n\nSenate President Karen Fann called it \"a blatant attempt at an insurrection.\"\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n4:10 p.m.: Name change for Grand Canyon features?\n\nThe layered geological peaks within the Grand Canyon weren’t always named Vishnu Temple, Thor or Zoraster. There was a time when they were known by the names Native Americans gave them.\n\nState Sen. Paul Boyer learned of this when he did a mule trip into the depths of Grand Canyon National Park last December. The guide on his mule train told the riders about the now long-neglected Native American names, abandoned in favor of names drawn from Hindu, Greek, Latin and Norse traditions\n\nThe lesson stuck with him, and earlier this year, Boyer introduced legislation to ask the federal government to restore the peaks’ original names.\n\n“I thought it would be a point of pride to revert back to what the names used to be,” Boyer, R-Glendale, said of his Senate Concurrent Memorial 1003.\n\nThe memorial is akin to a postcard to the federal government, letting the United States Board on Geographic Names know that the Arizona Legislature would like to see the parks’ geographic features be renamed with traditional Native American names.\n\nThe idea didn’t fly with Boyer’s colleagues in the House of Representatives, however. They rejected SCM 1003 on a 26-27 vote.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3 p.m.: Politics of Roe v. Wade take center stage\n\nThe business of the day is to wrap up the legislative calendar for the year, but lawmakers also took a chance to respond to the precedent-changing ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court overturning a woman's right to an abortion. (That leaves conflicting laws on the books in Arizona.)\n\nSenate Republican leadership praised the ruling.\n\n\"We are praising the good Lord today and thanking SCOTUS for their courage in the face of incredible and physical and political threat,\" the statement reads. \"Arizona State Senate Republicans will continue to fight for the sanctity of life, the rule of law, morals, family values and against radical Democrats who aim to change society in some very dark and disturbing ways.”\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Democratic party leaders took a break from work at the Capitol to join Planned Parenthood leaders to condemn the court ruling — and use it to mobilize voters ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\"I have a message for everyone,\" Sen. Raquel Terán, the party chair and a state senator from Phoenix, said outside the House of Representatives. \"We will not calm down. We are feeling angry. We are feeling hurt. We are feeling betrayed. And we are allowed to feel this way when the government is more concerned about regulating our bodies than our guns. Make no mistake, today is the day Republicans have worked for for decades.\"\n\nThere was an added law enforcement presence at the Capitol on Friday ahead of planned protests over the court decision. State troopers had begun blocking off roads and parking lots by early afternoon.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n12:15 p.m.: Prison agency briefly got the death penalty\n\nIn a stinging 19-34 vote, the House of Representatives rejected a continuation of the state prisons department but then quickly reversed course to revive it, with more oversight.\n\nThe lopsided vote against Senate Bill 1401 was a statement from both Republicans and Democrats about the performance of the state Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry.\n\nLed by Rep. Walt Blackman, a self-described \"corrections hawk\", lawmakers rebuked the agency that has come under intense scrutiny after escapes, claims of prisoner maltreatment, questionable spending and inoperable prison locks.\n\n“I am going to have to vote 'no' on this simply because of what I know about this agency,\" Blackman, R-Snowflake said. \"We do have good correctional officers, and there are people who need to be in prison.\"\n\nBut he reeled off a list of issues that he has questions about and argued that extending the agency's life for eight years was too much to ask.\n\nHe was joined by Rep. Steve Kaiser, R-Phoenix, who pointed out the agency ignored the recommendations in two state auditor general reports and then went behind Blackman's back to avoid his scrutiny.\n\nThat is \"gross bureaucracy at its best,\" Kaiser said.\n\nIn less than an hour, Rep. Shawnna Bolick, who shared in the critique of the agency, brought back the bill for reconsideration. She added an amendment that will require the auditor general to do an annual review of various aspects of the agency's performance.\n\nThat addition flipped attitudes, and the House approved the eight-year extension on a 48-4 vote.\n\nThe bill has already passed the Senate but will need another vote in that chamber because of the change made in the House.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n10:45 a.m. Friday: Lawmakers return to work, rested but ready to wrap up\n\nLike schoolchildren on the last day of class, antsy lawmakers returned to work Friday morning to tackle two major issues left on the agenda.\n\n“I can sense the urge to be … excited that we perhaps are on our final day of voting,” Rep. Travis Grantham, R-Gilbert, told his colleagues as they started the day's work. He begged lawmakers to stay focused after two long days of work Wednesday and Thursday so they could wrap up the session Friday, potentially in just a few hours.\n\n\"We’re going to turn phones off, we’re going to sit at our desks,\" he scolded from the dais at the front of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Senate is expected to soon resume its deliberations on the major water policy bill and expansion of school vouchers.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n10:20 p.m.: Vouchers poised for Senate vote Friday\n\nA bill that would give Arizona the largest voucher program in the nation advanced Thursday to a vote of the full Senate, but only after a prolonged debate among members of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe argument over Arizona’s Empowerment Scholarship Account program started late, ran long and frayed the tempers of lawmakers as well as some members of the public speaking on the topic. House Bill 2853 would expand Arizona’s ESA program to all of the state’s 1.1 million schoolchildren, providing a taxpayer-funded voucher that parents can use for private school tuition, homeschooling or a variety of other educational purposes. It passed 6-3, with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed.\n\nThe Senate is expected to take up the voucher debate Friday. President Karen Fann announced the Senate would wrap up work Thursday night after doing a few final reads on bills. The $1 billion water legislation still needs work, and lawmakers are tired from Wednesday night's (and Thursday morning's) marathon session.\n\nThe House already had announced it was leaving and would return at 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nHB 2853 passed the House onWednesday, also on a party line vote that was greeted with shouts of “shame, shame” from public-school supporters.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n8:35 p.m.: Big boost in housing funds\n\nFacing an ongoing housing crisis, the Arizona Legislature's bipartisan budget put more money toward affordable housing programs than had been allocated for years.\n\nThe budget moves $75 million to the Arizona Department of Housing, with the biggest chunk — $60 million into the Housing Trust Fund — to be distributed as grants for projects across the state. One-third of that total is earmarked for rural counties.\n\nAnother $4 million of the total will go to affordable housing programs on the Navajo and Hopi tribal nations, adding to a federal grant of $134.6 million announced by U.S. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly last month.\n\nBy comparison, the state deposited about $16 million in the Housing Trust Fund in the past three years.\n\nTomas Robles, co-executive director for the activist group LUCHA, compared the housing funding to the proposed $335 million to be spent on a border wall.\n\n\"This choice does not prioritize the needs of our most vulnerable communities,\" Robles said.\n\nReps. César Chávez, D-Phoenix, and Steve Kaiser, R-Phoenix, who filed an unsuccessful bill earlier this year that would have put $89 million into the trust fund, both praised the new appropriation.\n\n\"With a historic investment into the Arizona Housing Trust Fund, we will be able to protect Arizonans facing hardships,\" Chávez said.\n\nKaiser said he strongly supported the fund deposit. Kaiser also saw the passage of a bill he sponsored that forms a bipartisan committee to study the state's housing shortage and look for ways to \"mitigate its causes.\"\n\nThe bill was passed as an emergency measure, allowing the committee to begin meeting immediately. It's supposed to provide a report to the Senate by Jan. 1.\n\nA Department of Housing study showed the state needs an estimated 250,000 new housing units to keep up with demand, the department's director, Tom Simplot, said in an October op-ed.\n\nThe new budget also adds $5 million for an alternative homeless transition services program and another homeless services pilot grant of $10 million that requires participating cities and towns to pitch in 50% of the state's funding for any project.\n\nSeparately, the budget provides another $10 million to the East Valley Institute of Technology to construct and furnish a 64-bed transitional housing facility for foster youths aged 17 to 21.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n7 p.m. Rental tax bill fails in the Senate\n\nThe Arizona Senate failed to pass a bill that could have lessened the tax paid by people who rent homes and apartments in the state.\n\nSenate Bill 1116 would have prohibited cities and towns from charging sales tax on landlords who rent property. The tax rate can vary by municipality. Its supporters said eliminating it would amount to a benefit for renters, who pay the tax passed on by landlords, and who face high rents due to demand as well as inflation drawing more from their budgets.\n\nOpponents, who included a group of developers, said it would remove a financial incentive for municipalities to allow multifamily zoning that could ease the rental shortage in some cities.\n\nThe bill failed on a 15-11 vote in the Senate, with only Republicans in favor. The House passed the bill 33-25 Wednesday.\n\nThe 16th Republican vote in the Senate, Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, voted with Democrats against the bill, citing the cost to city revenues. A fiscal estimate on the bill said municipalities would lose more than $200 million in tax collections the first year it was fully implemented.\n\nIn Boyer’s district, that would have meant a $60 million cut to Phoenix’s revenues and $9 million cut in Glendale, the senator said, adding that money is necessary to fund public safety services at a time when shortages abound.\n\n“They need more bodies, not less,” Boyer said.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n6:20 p.m.: Committees advance $1B in water spending\n\nArizona House and Senate natural resource committees advanced proposals Thursday afternoon that would empower the Water Infrastructure Finance Authority of Arizona to dole out $1 billion allocated over the next three years to shore up the state’s water supply.\n\nThe plan roughly follows a proposal that Gov. Doug Ducey made at the start of the session but uses the existing agency that handles federal grants and loans instead of creating a new water authority.\n\nMost of the money would go to water augmentation and importation projects, such as seawater desalination in Mexico or water recycling. More than $200 million could go to conservation projects such as grants for drip irrigation installation on farms.\n\nFederal officials last week warned that the seven states that share the Colorado River must produce a plan this summer to conserve roughly as much water as Arizona alone takes from the Colorado River — between 2 million and 4 million acre-feet — but a $1 billion investment will likely yield less.\n\nA Mexican desalination plant that Arizona could support, in exchange for some of Mexico’s Colorado River water, would cost more than $2.5 billion and produce about 250,000 acre-feet a year.\n\nThe House committee voted 9-5 to send the legislation on for debate on the House floor, while the Senate committee approved it, 7-1.\n\n— Brandon Loomis\n\n4 p.m.: Fix for marijuana sales fails\n\nLawmakers killed a bill intended to resolve multiple issues involving Arizona’s marijuana dispensaries, including a testing requirement to ensure tainted products are not sold to the public.\n\nHouse Bill 2050 went down on a 36-22 vote, four votes shy of the 40 needed to pass. It had previously won approval from the Senate, but House members, perhaps prodded by the dispensary lobby, declined to add their support.\n\nRep. Joanne Osborne, R-Goodyear, criticized the 11th-hour nature of the bill, which was done on a strike-everything amendment and had not been vetted in any committees, including the House health panel, which she chairs. Without that scrutiny, she said, it’s impossible to know if the bill will cause harm or fix problems.\n\nThe legislation was prompted after an Arizona Republic investigation found contaminated marijuana on dispensary shelves. The bill would have created a testing regimen, which Rep. Pamela Powers-Hannley, D-Tucson, called a common-sense protective measure for marijuana users, particularly those with medical ailments.\n\nThe bill also would have ironed out local zoning issues that could block the ability of holders of social-equity licenses to open shop.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n3:45 p.m.: After rest, lawmakers tackle final issues of session\n\nWith multiple references to sleep deprivation and eying the end of the session, lawmakers returned to the Capitol early Thursday afternoon to tackle a few remaining policy issues.\n\nCommittees in both the House and Senate are meeting to hammer out details of a bill that would determine how the budget’s $1 billion-plus investment in water can be spent, and who has authority to oversee that spending.\n\nThe Senate is also expected to consider a massive expansion to the state’s school voucher program before it adjourns.\n\nBut as can be the case in the Legislature as negotiations are ongoing, work is getting underway hours after it was scheduled, signaling another all-nighter in the making.\n\n“Thank you for being patient today,” Rep. Gail Griffin, R-Hereford, told the committee she chairs, House Natural Resources, Energy and Water, as it began meeting at 3 p.m. “Lots of things happening, as you’re very much aware.”\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n7 a.m.: Minutes after budget vote, Ducey shows support\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey applauded the first and only bipartisan budget of his tenure that caps his two terms in office.\n\n“These investments demonstrate an unwavering commitment to do what the people of Arizona expect us to do: address today’s needs and prepare our state for the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead,” the governor said in a statement about 5:30 a.m. “This budget will truly leave Arizona better than we found it.”\n\nThe budget passed by lawmakers is billions more than the $14.2 billion Ducey proposed in spending in January and draws on an unexpected over $4 billion in surplus state revenues. It includes many of the governor’s priorities, including funding for water issues, border security, raises for state employees and a deposit into the rainy day fund, the state’s emergency bank account.\n\nThe state's flush coffers reflect a vastly different financial reality than when Ducey became Arizona's 23rd governor in 2015. The state had a projected $1 billion shortfall then.\n\nAs lawmakers ground through the budget slog until the sun rose on the state Capitol early Thursday, the governor was scheduled to be in Washington, D.C., with a group of about 250 high school students on a civics-focused trip sponsored by the Arizona Cardinals. He was expected to return to Arizona on Thursday. It is not yet known when he will sign the budget bills.\n\nDucey, who is term limited and cannot run again, leaves office in early 2023.\n\n— Stacey Barchenger\n\n5:45 a.m.: Senate OKs budget; end of session looms\n\nSenators cast the final budget vote at 5:25 a.m. on the 165th day of the Legislature but not before indulging in some self-congratulation for producing a bipartisan $18 billion spending package.\n\nThe deal came together late Wednesday and resulted in an overnight session that no one really saw coming earlier in the day. Staffers arrived not realizing their work day would bleed well into Thursday.\n\nAs the Senate closed out its budget work with a series of bipartisan budget votes, lawmakers commented on the unusual moment.\n\n“I think this is what most Arizonans wanted us to do tonight – to come together, to vote on a bipartisan budget,\" said Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix. \"I hope this is a sign of what we can do in the future.”\n\nMajority Leader Rick Gray, R-Sun City, said he had never really seen a bipartisan budget until today.\n\n“It’s encouraging we have actually come together,\" he said. Maybe, he added, there's a lesson here: the value of compromise.\n\nDucey applauded the bipartisan work, although he only name-checked Republican leaders in a Twitter thread.\n\nNot everyone was feeling warm and fuzzy about this kumbaya policy move.\n\nSen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, noted the nearly $5 billion increase in the budget from last year and said the across-the-aisle compromise cost too much.\n\n“If there’s silver lining, though, it’s very reflective of everyone’s true colors,\" she said. “At least the public will know who the conservatives are and who is not.\"\n\nShe encouraged those who voted for the budget to campaign on their bipartisan move. And make sure you tell voters, she added, that the other side of the aisle will get half of everything.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n4:30 a.m.: House passes 'historic' budget bill\n\nHouse Republicans and Democrats joined together for the first time in years to produce a bipartisan budget that boosts K-12 funding, pays off $1.5 billion in debt and provides long-awaited funding for a number of needs.\n\nThe House approved the last of 17 budget bills about 4 a.m.\n\nThe budget package is now being voted on by the Senate. if approved, it will head to Ducey for his signature or veto.\n\nRepublicans control the House by a single vote, and divisions within the GOP caused leaders to seek out Democrats' votes to ensure the state would still be running past the budget deadline of June 30.\n\nSeveral House members praised the budget's passage as a significant achievement.\n\n\"Bipartisanship is alive,\" Rep. César Chávez, D-Maryvale, said before voting for one of the bills.\n\nAfter the last vote, House Majority Leader Rep. Ben Toma, R-Peoria, said he considered the bipartisan budget historic and that he couldn't remember the last time Democrats and Republicans joined forces to produce a budget palatable to members of both parties.\n\nThe weeks of negotiations before the vote were sometimes hostile, sometimes collegial, and some GOP members wanted to leverage their own agendas until the last minute.\n\nDemocratic involvement made the rebellious Republican House members unnecessary in the end.\n\nToma noted that the budget included $1 billion in water infrastructure, another billion for roads and other infrastructure, $1.5 billion to pay down the state's debt, and at the same time included the state's biggest-yet expansion of a program that uses state money to subsidize private school tuition.\n\n\"It's a big win,\" he said.\n\nMany of the votes passed with strong bipartisan majorities. It takes 31 votes to pass a House bill, and some \"yes\" vote tallies were in the 40s or low 50s. A bill that sets up a high-tech security system for schools passed 52-7, for instance, with one member not voting.\n\nSome members disliked the budget, though, calling it \"bloated.\"\n\n\"It was the first time in its history that the a Republican majority has passed a Democratic budget,\" said Rep. Jaqueline Parker, R-Mesa. \"We spent $6 billion more this year than last year.\"\n\nRep. Mitzi Epstein, D-Tempe, voted yes for the K-12 budget bill but insisted it was nothing like \"historic.\"\n\n\"It's not a budget you can pass in the daylight,\" she said. \"We have $5 billion (in surplus funds) and oh, boy, we've put a little into education.\"\n\nBut Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association, said the bill shows that legislators have interest in \"backfilling\" the funding hole that has existed for more than a decade.\n\n\"It's a better bill than we saw at the beginning of the day,\" Garcia said, referring to the education bill that boosted K-12 funding. \"It's better than we saw last year.\"\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n2:30 a.m. Bipartisan criminal-justice bill passes\n\nThe state House passed a criminal justice bill on a bipartisan vote that aims to improve investigations of police use-of-force incidents and allow women who give birth in jail to be released to a treatment center.\n\nSponsored by House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, the bill would create a new division within the state Department of Public Safety that would independently investigate use-of-force incidents by Arizona police agencies and law enforcement officers suspected of committing a crime. Police agencies would have to either use the new Major Incident Division investigators, another police agency or a regional police task force to investigate use-of-force incidents.\n\nDemocratic Leader Rep. Reginald Bolding, R-Phoenix, said before voting for the bill that it would be an important measure to build up more trust provide \"healing\" in the community.\n\nThe bill also creates an Anti-Human Trafficking Grant Fund that would \"keep our children safe,\" according to Rep. Walt Blackman, R-Snowflake. The fund would be administered by the Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, which would use the money for various state anti-trafficking programs.\n\nA floor amendment by Rep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, added the provision about pregnant women in jail. The state corrections department would have to contract with a nonprofit organization and place up to 20 women in the program the first year, with up to 50 women per year placed in subsequent years. Children living at the center would be subject to separate security rules.\n\nThe bill was moved to the Senate.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\n12:50 a.m. Thursday: Democrats voting for budget\n\nArizona House Democrats announced that they had negotiated a deal with Republicans on a bipartisan budget featuring \"significant new investment in K-12 public education and universities.\"\n\nSpecifically, according to Democrats, they bargained away roughly $335 million for a border wall, which was to be presented in a separate bill, while picking up about $526 million of new money for K-12 funds — an 8.8% increase to permanent base funding. A provision that would have called for a tripling of tax credits for school tuition organizations was stripped out.\n\nThe budget also began the day with tens of millions of dollars for long-desired road projects on the Navajo Nation, which was likely put there to entice Democrats to vote for it, said Robbie Sherwood, Democratic spokesman in the House.\n\nHouse Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, said the bipartisan budget evolved when Republicans offered Democrats more K-12 spending, agreed to hold back on some Republican bills, and split out bills that Democrats that did not agree with so they could be voted on.\n\nThe House was still voting on budget bills at about 12:30 a.m., with some members estimating it could go on to the wee hours of the morning. The early bills were passing with overwhelming bipartisan support not seen for many years.\n\n— Ray Stern and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n10:45 p.m.: Senate jets through work\n\nThe Senate has started its work on the 18-bill budget package. In another sign this is the real deal: Sen. Juan Mendez, D-Tempe, who was excused from in-person attendance all session due to COVID-19 concerns, is present, voting from his office.\n\nThe Senate is racing through part of its agenda, moving through bills with hardly no discussion or objection from anyone. That's perhaps another signal that a bipartisan deal was already agreed to.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n10:05 p.m.: A real bipartisan moment?\n\nCould it be? A budget with both Republican AND Democratic votes? Not since the days of former Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano has Arizona seen a spending plan that could seriously take that label.\n\nBut as budget work is dragging out through the nighttime hours, there is increasing talk that the final product will get across the finish line with more than just a token Democrat voting \"yes.\" That also means we're likely to see Republicans in the unusual position of voting \"no.\"\n\nThe proof will come in the votes — and no formal ones have happened as of yet. But with the smell of pizza wafting out of the House, and plates of Chinese takeout on Senate desks, indications are both the House and Senate will press on tonight, and for as long as it takes, to get a budget completed and on its way to Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n7:45 p.m. Wednesday: Lawmakers turn attention to a deal\n\nA sure sign the Senate is getting serious about voting on a budget: Sen. Tyler Pace, R-Mesa, has returned from a business trip in Alaska. Pace left several weeks ago but promised to come back with one day's notice when budget voting got serious.\n\nHis vote is important, as the Republicans can't afford to lose even one of its 16 members or they would have to turn to Democrats for support. Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, has harshly criticized the budget as spending too much, especially on a list of 40-odd road projects.\n\n— Mary Jo Pitzl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/12/sanatorium-suit-eleven-shootings-slave-ship-ceremony-news-around-states/50481119/", "title": "Sanatorium suit, 7-Eleven shootings: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the last African people abducted into slavery and brought to America’s shores gathered over the weekend on a riverbank to pay tribute to their ancestors. The descendants of the 110 people aboard the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to bring enslaved African people to the United States, held a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the vessel’s arrival. Dressed in white and walking slowly to the beat of an African drum, the descendants made their way to the banks of the Mobile River near Alabama’s coast. A wreath of white, yellow and red flowers was carried into the river by a kayaker and released into the waters. The event marked the anniversary of the ship arriving 162 years ago with 110 enslaved people brought to the country against their will from what is now the west African nation of Benin, said Darron Patterson, president of the Clotilda Descendants Association. The 1860 voyage, which happened decades after the law banning the importation of slaves had taken effect, began as a bet when a wealthy plantation owner wagered he could import a shipload of slaves without being caught. The 2019 discovery of the remnants of the Clotilda sparked renewed interest in its saga. But Patterson said the focus should be on the people it carried. “It’s not about the ship. It’s not about sails or nails or wood. It’s about the people who were in the cargo hold. And their stories were amazing stories,” he said. Patterson’s great-great-grandfather, Kupollee – a beekeeper, farmer and woodworker – was one of the 110 on the ship.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Masks are again required for people using federal buildings or riding buses inside Denali National Park and Preserve because of high COVID-19 levels in the broader community. The park is instituting the mandate per U.S. Interior Department guidelines, which require masks when COVID-19 community levels reach the high status in the surrounding area. Both the Denali Borough north of the park and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough south of Denali reported their status as high in data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Masks covering the nose and mouth will be required for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status. They must be worn in all common and shared workspaces in buildings owned or controlled by the National Park Service, including visitor centers, lodges, gift shops and restaurants. Masks also are required to ride buses and courtesy shuttles inside the park.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A three-member U.S. appeals court panel has sided with state prison officials’ ban on sexually explicit material for inmates, denying a prison journal’s claims of First Amendment violations. The 9th Circuit panel in San Francisco issued an opinion Friday mostly supporting the Arizona Department of Corrections’ previous censorship of various issues of Prison Legal News. The state had challenged a district court’s permanent injunction of the ban and an order to deliver four issues unredacted. “We conclude that most of the Department’s redactions of the Prison Legal News issues … abide by the First Amendment,” Circuit Judge Eric Miller wrote. For example, it found the redaction of graphic passages from an October 2014 article were “rationally related” to discouraging sexual harassment of corrections officers. Representatives for the Arizona Department of Corrections and the Human Rights Defense Center, which publishes Prison Legal News, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday. The department established an order in 2010 prohibiting prisoners from sending, receiving or possessing sexually explicit material or content seen as “detrimental” to the safety and operation of prison facilities. It was issued after mostly female staff complained inmates were harassing them with sexual images.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Police have arrested a man on an attempted capital murder charge in a shooting that caused mass flight from a concert in the state’s northwest. Officers arrived at Parsons Stadium in Springdale soon before 11 p.m. Saturday to find a crowd fleeing and a man in his 20s with a gunshot wound in the “upper torso,” city police said in a statement. Capt. Jeff Taylor told the Associated Press he did not know who was performing or whether anyone else was injured in the evacuation. Paramedics took the wounded man to a local hospital, where witnesses told investigators that the suspected gunman was Erik Navareyes, according to the statement. About 1 a.m. Sunday, officers found Navareyes at a hospital in the neighboring community of Rogers. Police said hospital staff told them the 21-year-old had sought treatment there, saying he was in a fight and shot someone. Police arrested Navareyes and took him to the Washington County jail. He was not listed in jail records Sunday afternoon, and Taylor said he did not know whether the man had a lawyer. Taylor said that the gunshot victim survived but that he could not provide additional information on his health.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two people were killed and three wounded in shootings before dawn Monday at four 7-Eleven stores in Southern California, and authorities said they were seeking a lone gunman in at least three of the shootings. The shootings appear to have occurred after robberies or attempted robberies at the four convenience stores on July 11, or 7/11 – a day when the national 7-Eleven brand was celebrating its 95th birthday by giving out free Slurpee drinks. “Our hearts are with the victims and their loved ones,” 7-Eleven Inc. said in a statement. “We are gathering information on this terrible tragedy and working with local law enforcement.” It wasn’t immediately clear to investigators what prompted the shootings in the cities of Riverside, Santa Ana, Brea and La Habra, nor why the violence occurred July 11. “I think the only person to answer that would be the suspect,” said Officer Ryan Railsback, a spokesperson for the Riverside Police Department, where the first shooting happened about 1:50 a.m. “There’s no way it can be a coincidence of it being 7-Eleven, July 11.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The state Department of Corrections has rescinded a new policy barring parole officers from seeking criminal charges for people escaping community-corrections halfway houses after criticism that it would jeopardize public safety. State corrections officials reversed course last week and reinstituted seeking arrest warrants for halfway house escapes, The Gazette reports. The move by the Corrections Department not to pursue arrest warrants for individuals transitioning from prison who had escaped from halfway houses had generated criticism from law enforcement officials, prosecutors and halfway house operators. “This is nothing short of a dereliction of DOC’s duty to keep local communities safe while transitioning offenders back into those same communities,” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader wrote in a June 27 letter to Dean Williams, the executive director of the Department of Corrections. Because of the pushback, Williams and Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety, the state agency that oversees community-corrections halfway houses, planned to discuss the subject last week. Late Wednesday afternoon, Merideth McGrath, the Corrections Department’s director of parole, announced to her agency that she was reinstating seeking arrest warrants for such cases.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Years of attack by an invasive beetle species have decimated the state’s population of ash trees, endangering power lines and roadways and stretching towns’ budgets as they attempt to remove potential hazards. The iridescent green emerald ash borer beetle is believed to have come from Asia through Canada to the U.S. about 20 years ago and into Connecticut about 10 years ago. Experts say millions of the trees are now dead or dying. “It’s fair to say that all ash trees will succumb, in pockets more dramatically than others,” State Forester Chris Martin told The Republican-American. Removing a dead ash tree from private property can cost between $400 and $1,200, and decisions about who is responsible for tree removal are made in consultation with local tree wardens. Falling trees have killed two people in the state in recent years. “Some weeks we get bills for $12,000 or $8,000. It’s costing the town a lot of money,” Goshen First Selectman Todd Carusillo told the newspaper. Eversource has a $33 million budget for tree removal in 149 towns along 16,000 miles of roads. Sean Redding, the utility’s manager of vegetation, told the newspaper most trees in western Connecticut have already been affected and have been removed or fallen down on their own without risk to overhead lines or motorists.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island: Golf carts and other low-speed vehicles are once again allowed on some town streets after a Chancery Court official ordered the resort town to temporarily suspend enforcement of its ban. Resident Kim Espinosa sued Fenwick Island in late June in an attempt to overturn the town’s ordinance that prohibited most low-speed vehicles, including the yellow Moke – a specific type of electric golf cart – that Espinosa and her family have been using to get around Fenwick for the past year. Espinosa said she attempted to work with the town before going to the court system, to no avail. While Fenwick officials did not wish to comment on the pending litigation, the March ordinance says the ban was designed to “promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the property owners and residents of the Town of Fenwick Island.” In the June 21 lawsuit, Espinosa argued that the town’s ordinance interferes with her property rights and is in direct conflict with the state law regulating low-speed vehicles. The Delaware law allows LSVs – four-wheeled vehicles, excluding trucks, that can reach up to 20 mph but no more than 25 mph on paved surfaces – on any two-lane roads with speed limits of 35 mph or less. LSVs are not permitted on any dual highways unless to cross the highway to get to the other side.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Park Service has proposed closing the upper portion of Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park in an effort to protect natural resources and improve recreation, WUSA-TV reports. The upper portion would be closed to cars from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day every year, as the summer season often brings more people out to enjoy the park. It would remain open to drivers when many tourists and nature-lovers retreat in the chillier months. According to Chelsea Sullivan, a public affairs specialist with the National Park Service, the seasonal closure would include Bingham Drive, Sherrill Drive and Beach Drive in three sections. In late April 2020, the NPS temporarily expanded the closure of the upper portion of Beach Drive to increase socially distanced recreational opportunities for pedestrians and cyclists. The Park Service said the 2020 closure provided a “valuable opportunity for park visitors to recreate more freely and safely within Rock Creek Park.” The agency is inviting the public to review the environmental assessment and share comments through Aug. 11.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: After an arduous five-year process that involved a series of state and federal approvals, a fundraising effort that generated nearly $1 million, logistical challenges, and unimagined complications that included a global pandemic, the towering marble statue honoring Mary McLeod Bethune will be unveiled this week in the nation’s capital. At 11 a.m. Wednesday, the sculpture that was artfully chiseled out of a 13-foot-long block of precious marble will be dedicated in the U.S. Capitol Building’s National Statuary Hall. Civic leaders and elected officials in Daytona Beach see the milestone as an opportunity to introduce the world to the accomplishments of one of the city’s iconic figures, depicted in a statue conceived and created with meticulous attention to detail. The statue will be one of the two representing Florida in the Capitol, replacing a nearly 100-year-old bronze sculpture of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. And Bethune’s statue will be the first representing a Black person in the state collection inside Statuary Hall. Four other Black people are represented in other parts of the Capitol: Martin Luther King Jr., Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks. The Smith statue was removed this past fall and will be placed in temporary storage at the Museum of Florida History in Tallahassee.\n\nGeorgia\n\nElberton: Two days after the Georgia Guidestones were destroyed by a bomb, a group of Elbert County residents gathered at the crime scene with a backhoe to dig further into the mysterious 42-year-old landmark. When the Stonehenge-type monument north of Elberton was unveiled in 1980, it was noted that a time capsule was buried 6 feet below the gigantic stone monoliths. “We dug down about 7 feet until we hit compacted Georgia red clay that had never been disturbed – and we found nothing,” Chris Kubas, executive vice president of the Elberton Granite Association, said Friday. “We didn’t know what we were likely to find anyway.” The lack of the time capsule is yet another mystery clouding the Georgia Guidestones, a roadside attraction that had brought thousands of tourists a year to Elberton. The granite sculpture generated publicity over the years in numerous books, television documentaries and social media hype. Before dawn July 6, someone set off a bomb that shattered one of the 19-foot-high, 28-ton blocks of granite. Now that the county’s most widely discussed landmark is gone, there is some talk about rebuilding. “I’ve had several granite manufacturers tell me they would be interested in donating resources and materials to rebuild if ultimately that is decided,” Kubas said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige signed a law Monday authorizing $600 million toward housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gem State native and “Breaking Bad” star Aaron Paul is putting his midcentury modern home in the city on the market, the Idaho Press reports. Designed by renowned architect Art Troutner and taking after the style of Frank Lloyd Wright, the home – known as “The Klein House” – boasts more than 2,000 square feet and was listed last week for more than $1.3 million. Paul and his wife also own a large home in McCall, Idaho, according to the newspaper.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The head of the Illinois Department of Human Services has been ordered to return to Sangamon County Circuit Court on charges of ignoring another court order to transport a county jail inmate into state custody. The court ruled Friday that Grace Hou, secretary of IDHS, must appear in court July 15 to respond to charges of ignoring an order to place Christopher Hall, 38, of Beloit, Wisconsin, in the Andrew McFarland Mental Health Center for psychiatric treatment. Hall, who had been charged last year on four counts of first-degree murder, aggravated discharge of a firearm, being an armed habitual offender and unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon in the shooting death of Hason Willis, 43, of Springfield, was ruled unfit to stand trial in May and ordered to be placed at McFarland. However, the order said that as of Friday, he had not been placed there, remaining in custody at the Sangamon County Jail. IDHS had previously been held in contempt last month in a similar case in which a Springfield man had not been transported to state custody despite a court order. Judge Adam Giganti had ruled that DHS would have to pay $100 a day each day that he was not in state custody.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette: Back a Boiler, Purdue University’s controversial income share agreement program, has been suspended for the upcoming academic year, but previous participants are still on the hook for costly contracts many say they signed after falling for deceptive marketing tactics. The decision to suspend the program raised questions for Purdue students and alumni holding Back a Boiler agreements, which require participants to pay back a portion of their post-graduation monthly earnings for a set period of time or until they hit a maximum payment cap. The program has been under fire since an advocacy group asked the U.S. Department of Education to investigate it, alleging that some of the marketing tactics and agreement terms violate federal law. Purdue has “brazenly ignored” rules and laws that govern financial products such as the income share agreements it offers, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center. In its letter to the education department, the nonprofit alleges that the university has done so “as part of a scheme to drive its students to take on risky, high-rate private student loans.” The university has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson said that the program was suspended due to a change in the third party that services the agreements and that it had no bearing on the outstanding contracts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A beach at Lake of Three Fires State Park is closed as a precaution after a swimmer was diagnosed with Naegleria fowleri, commonly called “brain-eating amoeba,” according to a news release from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. The closure is in response to the confirmed infection of the microscopic, single-celled, free-living amoeba in a Missouri resident with a potential exposure while swimming at the park in southern Iowa’s Taylor County. The swimmer, undergoing treatment in an intensive care unit for the infection, was likely exposed to the Iowa lake water over the last two weeks of June, though officials didn’t have specific dates. Iowa state health officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are testing to confirm the presence of the infection in the lake. Naegleria fowleri is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water such as lakes, rivers and ponds. It can “cause a rare, life-threatening infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis,” health officials said in the release. People are infected when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose, usually while swimming or diving in lakes and rivers. It cannot spread from one person to another, health officials said. Infections are rare, with 33 across the U.S. from 2011 to 2020, according to the CDC.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The city saw a 78% rise last year in the number of traffic crashes that occur at its intersections and is on pace to finish this year with a similar total. Meanwhile, a growing number of residents have told police Chief Bryan Wheeles they think Topeka’s intersections have become less safe – particularly due to drivers running red lights, police Capt. Colleen Stuart said. Officers are responding this month by cracking down on drivers who run red lights as part of an initiative to make Topeka intersections safer, the police department announced June 30 on its Facebook page. “You may see a concentration of officers at various intersections throughout our city reinforcing safe driving practices,” that post said. It drew an enthusiastic response from Facebook users, who made more than 200 comments in reply. “Thank you!” wrote local resident Susan Blanck-Harlan. “Innocent people are going to get killed, if this isn’t stopped.” Another person joked about how often he sees drivers run red lights. He wrote: “No cop, no stop.” Topeka Municipal Court assesses a $100 fine for a red light violation, plus court costs totaling $76, according to its website.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Another lawsuit has been filed over the historic Waverly Hills Sanatorium, touted by paranormal thrill-seekers as one of the most spirit-infested places in the world. The new filing last month by owner Charlie Mattingly and CEM Land Co., which Mattingly formed more than 20 years ago to buy the land, seeks to evict the historical society he created to maintain the facility and handle tours. The Waverly Hills Historical Society says it’s still on the premises, but Mattingly is pushing for the historical society to vacate the property within seven days of the court’s approval. The case filed in Jefferson District Court is set for a pretrial conference July 18. Mattingly and the Waverly Hills Historical Society already were engaged in a bitter legal dispute over its ownership. The historical society has argued Mattingly failed to maintain the grounds and damaged the property with its actions, prompting members to push to evict him. Mattingly counters that those claims are unfounded and that his ouster has sullied his reputation. Historical society President Renae Clark said in the 2021 lawsuit that Mattingly and his wife were “required” to leave the property nearly two years ago after his wife, Tina Mattingly, was fired as the historical society’s executive director over “internal complaints.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The superintendent of Louisiana State Police has acknowledged he was pulled over for speeding in an unmarked work vehicle but did not receive a ticket from one of his own officers. Col. Lamar Davis told WAFB-TV he accepts responsibility but does not remember how fast he was driving. A state trooper pulled Davis over June 28 on the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge along Interstate 10 west of Baton Rouge. “I was simply wrong in that situation,” Davis said in an interview Friday. “There is no excuse for it, other than I need to slow my butt down.” The head of Louisiana State Police public affairs, Capt. Nick Manale, said the trooper “utilized his discretion and did not issue a citation.” Manale said the trooper did not make notes about how fast Davis was driving in the area where the speed limit was 60 mph. WAFB obtained a copy of the trooper’s body camera footage through a public records request. On Thursday, Louisiana State Police released the trooper’s body camera footage and a snippet of video from the trooper’s dashboard camera. The body camera footage cuts off as soon as the trooper exits his vehicle and recognizes he has pulled over his boss. “Well, I’ll be,” the trooper says just before the video stops.\n\nMaine\n\nBrooksville: A superfund mining site is receiving $21 million in Environmental Protection Agency funding to expedite contamination cleanup efforts. The Callahan Mine superfund site in Brooksville originally received $9 million from the bipartisan federal infrastructure bill passed in November last year, but an additional $12 million has now been approved to address the contamination at the site, the EPA said in a statement. “It’s a priority for EPA to get this site off the Superfund backlog list. Cleaning up this site is key for the Brooksville community to develop alternatives for potential future uses in this area,” New England’s EPA director David Cash said in the statement. Brooksville site has been on a priority list for the EPA since 2002 and has been waiting for funding since the current cleanup phase in 2019. The funding is a part of a larger plan the agency has to help clean up superfund sites in communities across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: After securing a new state permit, a Johns Hopkins University researcher will be allowed to continue medical experiments on barn owls that have been criticized by a leading animal rights group. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has campaigned for years to end the researcher’s experiments it calls “cruel” and “worthless,” The Baltimore Sun reports. The group has lodged complaints with state regulators about the legality of Hopkins’ testing practices. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources last month issued Hopkins a new permit that allows the experiments to continue. The university has defended the experiments, saying associate professor Shreesh Mysore’s work could yield critical insight into medical conditions, including ADHD, autism and schizophrenia. The experiments involve the placement of electrodes into the brains of the owls. The electrodes do not hurt or damage the birds, though the owls are ultimately euthanized, Eric Hutchinson, director of the university’s Research Animal Resources, told the newspaper.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Signs around a construction site for what’s been called the first LGBTQ-friendly senior affordable housing project in New England were vandalized with threatening graffiti over the weekend, drawing quick condemnation from civic leaders. The messages in black spray paint were left on signs on the security fence around the former school in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood, according to LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc., the nonprofit behind the 74-unit complex known as The Pryde. The project that broke ground last month is expected to welcome its first residents in late 2023. Gretchen Van Ness, executive director of LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc., doesn’t live far from the construction site and said she started getting emails about the vandalism from neighbors out walking their dogs about 8:30 a.m. Sunday. “We’ve received such widespread support in the neighborhood, and we’ve really been welcomed,” she said. “This is not how the majority of people in Hyde Park feel.” The vandalism was reported to Boston police just before 11 a.m. Sunday, a department spokesperson said Monday. The matter was referred to the department’s civil rights unit, Officer Andre Watson said. There had been no arrests as of Monday morning. At an afternoon rally, Mayor Michelle Wu called the vandalism “pathetic.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Abortion rights are poised to come before the state’s voters in November after an abortion rights campaign turned in a record-breaking number of signatures Monday for a ballot initiative to the secretary of state’s office. The effort will further increase attention on Michigan’s elections, where the battleground state’s Democratic governor and attorney general have made abortion rights a centerpiece of their reelection campaigns. The push to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution comes weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave states the power to decide whether to ban the procedure. The ruling is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states. Michigan is among several states with a pre-Roe abortion law that was set to take effect if the federal judicial ruling was overturned. However, a judge issued an injunction that temporarily blocked the 1931 law, which would make abortion a felony in all cases, except when “necessary to preserve the life of such woman.” “The number of signatures showed that here in Michigan we trust women. We trust people. We trust doctors, not politicians, to make decisions about our body, our pregnancy and parenthood,” Reproductive Freedom for All spokesperson Shanay Watson-Whittaker said during a news conference in Lansing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A judge declared many of the state’s restrictions on abortion unconstitutional Monday, including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor can get an abortion. Ramsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan also struck down Minnesota’s requirements that only physicians can perform abortions and that abortions after the first trimester must be performed in hospitals. His order took effect immediately, meaning the limits can’t be enforced. Gilligan ruled in a lawsuit by Gender Justice and other abortion rights supporters that successfully argued the restrictions were unconstitutional under a landmark 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling known as Doe v. Gomez, which held that the state constitution protects abortion rights. The judge called that case “significant and historic” and said it’s unaffected by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. “These abortion laws violate the right to privacy because they infringe upon the fundamental right under the Minnesota Constitution to access abortion care and do not withstand strict scrutiny,” Gilligan wrote.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A judge has ruled that the mayor did not have the power to veto a contract that the City Council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage, news outlets report. The Jackson City Council sued after Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an emergency order to award a garbage collection contract to Richard’s Disposal. The council had voted multiple times against giving the contract to the the New Orleans-based company. “There’s nothing there to veto. The council didn’t pass affirmatively the matter. It rejected it,” said Roberts, a retired Mississippi Court of Appeals judge who was appointed to hear the case in Hinds County Chancery Court. Jessica Ayers, an attorney for the mayor, argued that he has the power to veto the negative vote. “You can expect the possibility of us appealing this matter,” Lumumba said.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A federal judge on Friday threw out a lawsuit by Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt that blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh said in his 38-page ruling that in this case federal rules prohibit a sovereign foreign entity from being sued in American courts. “All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh stated in the final line of the dismissal order. The judge noted earlier in the opinion that the civil suit against China is one of many filed “amidst the wreckage of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Schmitt’s office said it would appeal the ruling. The complaint filed in April 2020 alleges that Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.” Schmitt said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread. China criticized the lawsuit as “very absurd” and said it has no factual and legal basis. Schmitt called the lawsuit historic, but legal experts mostly panned it as a stunt aimed at shifting blame to China for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Kris Hansen, who recently departed the No. 2 post at the Montana Attorney General’s Office, has died at age 52, according to state officials. A news release from the Montana Department of Justice said Hansen died early Thursday, the Independent Record reports. No information about her cause of death was released. Hansen was named chief deputy of the Montana Department of Justice in December 2020. Before that, she worked for the Montana state Auditor’s office and represented Havre as a Republican state lawmaker. In late May, Hansen confirmed she was leaving the office but declined to say why. The Attorney General’s Office said at the time that she was leaving to “attend to personal and family matters.” “Kris was a dear friend, a conservative leader, and an amazing woman who dedicated her life to others,” Attorney General Austin Knudsen said in a statement Friday. Hansen was a central figure during the state Republicans’ conflict with the judicial branch last year. Hansen, representing GOP lawmakers who’d subpoenaed judicial records, wrote a public letter accusing the Supreme Court of interfering with a legislative investigation by quashing a subpoena for judicial records. The court ultimately ruled state lawmakers had overstepped their authority with the subpoenas.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Republican state Sen. Mike Flood will officially join the U.S. House on Tuesday, when he’s sworn in to fill the seat of disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry. Flood will take his oath of office at the U.S. Capitol. Flood, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, defeated Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks in a special election to represent the state’s 1st Congressional District, which includes Lincoln and dozens of smaller communities. Fortenberry, a Republican, resigned in March shortly after a California jury found him guilty of charges that he lied to federal investigators about $30,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a Nigerian billionaire. He was sentenced to probation and fined. Flood will hold the seat until at least January, for what would have been the rest of Fortenberry’s term. He’ll face Pansing Brooks again in the November general election to determine who serves the next full term.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Visitors to the Fremont Street Experience will be required to go through metal detectors and bag checks and will be subject to age requirements to enter the Las Vegas pedestrian mall in a new step to curb increased violence. Metal detectors, bag checks, a curfew for unaccompanied minors and 18- to 20-year-olds, and increased law enforcement presence will be used on weekends until further notice, according to Fremont Street Experience officials. The security measures come in response to increased aggravated assaults and a recent homicide at the downtown tourist spot. “The safety and security of our guests, employees and tenants has been and will always be our priority,” Andrew Simon, Fremont Street Experience’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “Everything else is secondary. The incidents from the past week cannot and will not be tolerated. Our tourism, jobs and safety will not be threatened by these actions.” Public safety officials said they have noticed an increase in violent crime on and around the five-block district, where visitors often gather to visit casinos, see concerts, drink and gawk at the canopied video screen.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranklin: Pots, pans, silverware and a foot warmer were among the nearly two dozen items stolen from the house where statesman Daniel Webster was born, a state parks official said. Webster, a lawyer and orator who served as secretary of state under three presidents and represented Massachusetts and New Hampshire in Congress, was born in the two-room cabin in Franklin in 1782. Randy Kovach of the New Hampshire State Parks told WMUR-TV that most of the items, which were taken sometime between July 3 and July 8, are replicas and don’t have much value. “They were all mostly either pewter, tin or iron,” Kovach said. “So if you wanted to melt them down, you’re going to weigh a lot, but you’re not going to get a lot of money.” Franklin police said they’ve reached out to pawn shops and are using K-9 dogs to try to track down the items. “It saddens me that we can’t give quite the educational show that we’d do if we had those items to explain to the children and the people about the way we lived in the 1700s,” Kovach said. “Whoever took them – I hope they can make a good home for them and needed them more than we did.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall: A black bear and two cubs were spotted at Shark River Park on Thursday amid a spike of sightings near the Jersey Shore. Summer Hill Camp decided to keep kids off trails after a staff member reported seeing the bear family, camp Director Lauren Cheney said. The sighting was just one of about a dozen and a half this year in Monmouth County. Bears have been sighted in Freehold Township, Holmdel, Howell, Middletown and Atlantic Highlands. Another bear was spotted in Wall in May, said Caryn Shinske, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. In 2021, there were two bears seen in Monmouth County, according to the DEP. Ocean County has also seen a sharp uptick. A bear or bears have been spotted in Barnegat, Lakewood, Little Egg Harbor, Stafford and Toms River. So why the Jersey Shore? Brooke Maslo, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources at Rutgers, said while the bear population is mostly concentrated in the northwest part of the state − hemmed in by Routes 80 and 287 because they’re so hard to cross − there are black bears in all 21 counties in New Jersey. It’s just that you don’t see them much. They steer clear of humans as a rule. “Bears are pretty secretive in general,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state is committing $1.7 million to repair a collapsed bridge and implement additional flood mitigation strategies in the area. Lujan Grisham made the announcement Saturday next to the damaged bridge in northeast Roswell. The city has received close to 3 inches of rain so far this year and began experiencing intense flooding following severe torrential rainfall last year. The $1.7 million is coming from the New Mexico Department of Transportation’s State Road Fund. The funding will go to repairing the bridge and implementing flood mitigation measures to be ahead of the curve before the next major storm hits, according to Lujan Grisham. “The more we put into communities, so that we have safe roads, safe bridges, safe flood mitigation, the better it is for these communities,” she said. The bridge previously collapsed due to flooding in 2013. Though it was replaced, additional changes to address the flooding vulnerabilities were not implemented, according to Albuquerque TV station KOB.\n\nNew York\n\nMelville: More sharks are being spotted in the waters off Long Island, a trend that is likely to continue – and experts say that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Cleaner oceans, warmer water temperatures and a resurgence of bunker fish that sharks feed on are seen as factors, according to experts. Detection, from drones to helicopters, also has improved, and reports are easily spread through social media. “There are a lot more sharks than 10 or 15 years ago,” Christopher Paparo, manager of Stony Brook University’s Marine Sciences Center, told Newsday. “In the 1960s, we did not have sharks, whales and dolphins.” Shark attacks in the area have been very rare until recently, with an average of about one reported per 10 years for the past century, Newsday reports. Within the past two weeks, two lifeguards suffered bites, and a third person was bitten in a possible shark attack, according to the newspaper. Experts say the increase in the number of sharks is a sign conservation efforts have succeeded in helping restore ecological balance to the oceans, after overfishing, pollution and a movement to kill sharks partly inspired by the 1975 movie “Jaws” reduced their numbers. Smaller sharks, seen closer to shore more often than larger ones, help keep prey species in check, and many shark types are scavengers that keep the ocean cleaner and healthier.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will begin installing body-scanning equipment in its middle schools this summer to ensure students don’t have guns or other weapons. The district’s Interim Superintendent Hugh Hattabaugh told The Charlotte Observer of the plans Friday. The technology is already employed in all 21 of the district’s traditional high schools. “It may seem (like) an inconvenience, but I see it as a positive for our students,” Hattabaugh said. “This is another one of those important steps to keep our schools safe and orderly.” The technology will be rolled out in phases beginning in August, the newspaper reports. Its implementation comes after guns turned up in the district’s schools at a record rate during the previous school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection won’t restore hours of operation to pre-pandemic levels at some ports of entry in the state, despite pressure from Gov. Doug Burgum. In a letter to the agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent Friday, Burgum said the reduced hours at several North Dakota port crossings along the U.S.-Canadian border “causes significant hardship on the movement of citizens, goods and tourists between our two nations.” In a statement to the Associated Press on Friday, the federal agencies said longer opening hours cannot be justified because of the shrinking volume of traffic at the border crossings – a decline that began even before the pandemic. “For several years, pre-COVID, CBP documented a reduction in vehicles and pedestrian traffic along our northern border, and CBP’s obligation is to utilize all available resources responsibly to perform our mission of safeguarding the homeland,” the statement said. North Dakota has 17 border crossings, and the one at Pembina on Interstate 29 in the northeastern part of the state is the busiest. In April 2020, hours of operation were reduced by several hours in the evening at 10 of crossings. Hours also were shortened at some ports of entry in Montana, Minnesota, Idaho and Washington, and they will remain that way, agencies said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A Democratic proposal to force “deadbeat dads” to pay for unintended pregnancies just got a boost from an unexpected source: Christian lobbyists. Senate Bill 226 would allow those who are pregnant to sue those who caused the pregnancy, regardless of the circumstances. A judge could award at least $5,000. State Sen. Tina Maharath, D-Columbus, said the bill is particularly important after Roe v. Wade was overturned, forcing people either to leave Ohio for abortions or to deliver babies from unintended pregnancies. Ohio law now bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is about six weeks into a pregnancy. At that point, many don’t yet realize they are pregnant. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. The average cost of childbirth in Ohio is $15,000, Maharath said. “Too often, this cost is solely the mother’s to bear, especially in the case of an unintended pregnancy. However, the father shares equal responsibility for the pregnancy, and it is only right that he pays equally for it.” On Friday, Center for Christian Virtue President Aaron Baer announced that his organization agrees. “Senator Tina Maharath’s legislation is an innovative approach to combat the hook-up culture that has led to broken lives, hurting women, and abandoned children,” Baer said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An influential political action committee that has helped elect Republicans to the state Senate has agreed to dissolve and pay a fine of more than $60,000 to the state after an investigation revealed multiple state campaign finance rule violations. The Republican Senatorial Committee entered into a settlement agreement Friday with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. The PAC officials acknowledged accepting more than $35,000 of impermissible contributions from corporations or contributions earmarked for a specific candidate or candidate committee. Both contributions violate state ethics rules. Glenn Coffee, the former Republican leader of the Senate and now an attorney representing the PAC, declined to comment on the settlement. Under the agreement, the PAC agreed to pay $37,750 to the state’s general fund, an amount equal to the impermissible contributions it accepted, plus another $25,000 in civil penalties. PAC officials also agreed to dissolve the committee and dispose of any remaining assets.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The patience of Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters seems to be growing thin as the state continues to violate the constitutional rights of criminal defendants charged with crimes who cannot afford an attorney. “Hundreds who are constitutionally entitled to counsel are being denied that right, and no end is in sight,” Walters wrote in a letter sent July 1 to the eight commissioners who oversee the state’s public defense agency. Four times in her six-page letter, Walters called on the board to “direct” the executive director of the Office of Public Defense Services “to prepare a plan for presentation” at a meeting later this month, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. She said she seeks a plan that proposes immediate steps that will enable the Public Defense Services Commission to fulfill its obligation to provide lawyers for those who have a constitutional right to representation. The person she asked commissioners to direct is Stephen Singer, who took over the Office of Public Defense Services in December. Many of the problems facing the public defense system in Oregon go back years. Since last fall, the state has continued to charge people with crimes and hold some of them in custody, despite a shortage of public defenders.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Nursing home trade associations in the state said Monday that they have agreed to boost staffing levels as part of a deal with Gov. Tom Wolf to increase aid to an industry struggling with high turnover. With Pennsylvania awash in surplus tax collections, Wolf on Monday signed legislation authorizing nearly $300 million a year – almost 20% more annually – in additional Medicaid payments to nursing homes, which were wracked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade associations had worked out a compromise on staffing levels with Wolf’s administration and SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, a labor union that represents about 5,000 nursing home workers, prior to the legislation being signed. “This is a major step forward for Pennsylvania’s long-term care industry,” Wolf told a Capitol news conference after signing the measure. Officials say the money should boost worker salaries, staffing levels and retention while stabilizing the facilities’ finances and improving the quality of care. Matt Yarnell, president of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, said the ravages of the pandemic on nursing homes helped persuade state budgetmakers to grant an increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate. Pennsylvania’s Medicaid reimbursement rate increase is the first in almost a decade, trade associations said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman hired to work for a house cleaning service was fired just days later after management found out she was pregnant, the woman said in a discrimination lawsuit filed Monday. The suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island on behalf of Bristol resident Julia Schultz alleges the owners of Merry Maids of Rhode Island violated state civil rights law. Schultz applied for the house cleaner position in late April 2021, when she was about 16 weeks pregnant, according to the lawsuit. She attended an orientation program for new hires in early May 2021, during which the company’s co-owner asked if she was pregnant, according to the suit. When she confirmed she was, the co-owner said she could not offer her the job because of its “physical demands” and said she “should be at home taking care” of the baby. She then suggested Schultz reapply after the baby’s birth. “When I left the building that day, I felt so ashamed, like I was doing something wrong by trying to work while pregnant,” Schultz said. “Especially with Roe v. Wade getting overturned, it’s even more important now to fight for our rights, fight against the wealth gap between men and women, and empower women, not try to keep them down based on old, outdated traditions.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two trains collided Monday morning, causing one of them to derail and leaving two railway employees hospitalized, according to the Columbia-Richland Fire Department. No additional injuries were expected. A diesel fuel leak was contained and posed no danger to the public or environment, Columbia Fire Chief Aubrey D. Jenkins told the Associated Press. The incident occurred in a wooded area in southeast Columbia with no nearby homes. The derailment will not negatively affect traffic or the environment, Jenkins said. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control was working with the fire department, private contractors and rail officials to reopen the rail line. Fire crews arrived on the scene shortly after the incident occurred about 8:20 a.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a company that wants to do some exploratory drilling for gold in the Black Hills. The land involved is near the Pactola Reservoir in the Black Hills National Forest and is owned by the federal government. Minneapolis-based F3 Gold has been seeking approval for its drilling project for several years. The Forest Service has now completed its final environmental assessment and issued a draft decision that would allow the drilling to move forward, but with numerous restrictions to protect cultural sites, water and other natural resources, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. The draft decision is subject to a 45-day objection period. The Forest Service would consider any objections before issuing a final decision. “After an exhaustive, multi-year process atypical for a small-scale exploration drilling project, we are pleased that we are finally getting our permit,” F3 Gold Vice President Brian Lentz said in a statement. The Forest Service draft decision allows for 47 drilling pads on more than 3 acres near Jenny Gulch. Lilias Jarding of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance said exploratory drilling could eventually lead to a gold mine, which could pollute the Pactola Reservoir, which is a popular recreational destination and a storage reservoir for water systems including Rapid City’s.\n\nTennessee\n\nMartin: The University of Tennessee at Martin has committed to improving its landscape for pollinators and is now an affiliate of the Bee Campus USA program, officials said. Bee Campus USA is an initiative of the nonprofit Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. The goal is to sustain pollinators by providing healthy habitats that include a variety of native plants without pesticides, the school said in a statement. “UT Martin serves a key agricultural region and protecting our bee population is necessary for our farms and communities,” UT Martin Chancellor Keith Carver said in a statement last week. UT Martin professor of wildlife biology Eric Pelren said the school has added more trees and plants that are beneficial to pollinators, is committed to minimizing the use of dangerous pesticides, and will work to raise awareness about pollinators.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A pregnant woman ticketed for driving in a high occupancy vehicle lane plans to fight the charge in court by arguing that her unborn daughter now counts as a person. When an officer pulled Brandy Bottone over for driving by herself in a HOV lane just days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she pointed to her belly. “I said, ‘Well, not trying to throw a political mix here, but with everything going on, this counts as a baby,” said Bottone, who was eight months pregnant when she was pulled over June 29. Bottone, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Plano, said she’ll fight the ticket in court next week. Her story was first reported by The Dallas Morning News. “I was driving to pick up my son. I knew I couldn’t be a minute late, so I took the HOV lane,” she said. Bottone’s ticket came five days after the Supreme Court stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion. In Texas, that put in motion a trigger law that will ban virtually all abortions in the coming weeks and defines an unborn child as a living human from fertilization to birth. Bottone said the stand she’s taking on the ticket isn’t for or against abortion, but the law should be uniform. “If there’s a pro-women category, that’s my stance,” she said.\n\nUtah\n\nPark City: A member of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” pleaded guilty Monday to a fraud conspiracy charge that could result in a prison sentence of over 11 years. Jennifer Shah, 48, of Park City, entered the plea to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in Manhattan federal court after signing a plea agreement with New York prosecutors a day earlier that carries a recommended sentencing range of 11 to 14 years behind bars. She told a judge that beginning in 2012, she participated in a massive telemarketing fraud for nearly a decade that prosecutors say cheated thousands of people nationwide, including some over age 55. She said she knew that she was teaming up with others to market products to people “that had little or no value.” “I knew this was wrong and that many people were harmed, and I’m so sorry,” Shah told Judge Sidney H. Stein. Sentencing was set for Nov. 28. Shah remained free on bail but did not speak as she left the courthouse and walked a short distance to a waiting vehicle. In a statement afterward, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Shah a “key participant in a nationwide scheme that targeted elderly, vulnerable victims.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ten of the state’s immigrant farmworkers filed a joint petition June20 for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop their deportations. The 10 farmworkers are all men from Mexico who have lived in Vermont for years. Some arrived to U.S. on the H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers, but those visas have since expired, and the workers are now unable to obtain legal permission to live in the country. The 10 workers are also active members of Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based nonprofit that works for the human rights of Vermont’s immigrant communities. “I came to Vermont from Mexico when I was 16 years old and have been working on dairy farms ever since. I was pulled over by ICE in 2019 for no reason and detained,” Pedro Ubaldo, one of the ten workers, said through a translator. “Now they are trying to deport me to Mexico, but my life is here. I am fighting to stay in Vermont to provide for my family and organize with my community for a better future.” Migrant Justice said the men – who have been dubbed the “Migrant Justice 10” – were racially profiled by ICE and arrested for lacking immigration papers. They were each arrested separately over the past several years and incarcerated in immigration detention facilities until they were released on bond.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: New round-trip Amtrak routes began Monday between Washington, D.C., and two Virginia cities: Norfolk and Roanoke. The additions bring to eight the number of state-funded round trips from the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reports. “We’re adding more options for people at the right time,” said Michael McLaughlin, chief operating officer at the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. “Capacity on the trains is getting full, and ridership is at record-high levels.” The extra train to Norfolk will be the third round trip to the area, according to the newspaper. It will depart Norfolk at 1 p.m. and arrive in Washington in a little over 4.5 hours. A new southbound train will depart Washington at 12:05 p.m. Amtrak already runs one morning trip from Roanoke to D.C. and an evening return trip. Starting Monday, a new train will leave Washington for Roanoke at 8:05 a.m., and a Washington-bound train will leave Roanoke at 4:30 p.m., arriving shortly before 9:30 p.m. Amtrak, which expanded service to Richmond last year, said the additions will give riders more options to travel in Virginia and boost connections to the Northeast. Virginia is among 17 states that have state-sponsored Amtrak service, the Post reports.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new program in King County is tapping people who have experienced homelessness in the past to help currently unhoused people get off the street. The King County Regional Homelessness Authority hopes the program will get nearly every person living outside downtown into long-term, stable housing. Kirk Rodriguez does outreach work talking to people around Pioneer Square. Rodriguez used to be homeless when he moved to Seattle six years ago. After about two years on the street, he got into state-sanctioned housing. Rodriguez said that when he was figuring out where to live and finding other services he needed, he did it alone – he didn’t have anyone to help guide him through the process. “No, I did not; I wish that I had,” he told KUOW near City Hall Park recently. “It would have made a huge difference.” Rodriguez works on the City Hall Park Neighborhood Outreach Team, a group of about eight who go out multiple times a day to check with people in the area. The team gives out food, hand warmers, and toiletries like tampons and condoms. “If there’s somebody who’s looking like maybe they’re having a rough day or could use some snacks or whatever else, we’ll engage,” Rodriguez said. “We make sure to say hi no matter what.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRocket Center: Northrop Grumman Corp. plans to build a new missile integration facility in the state. The company announced plans last week to build the 113,000-square-foot facility to increase its capacity to deliver weapons to meet warfighter needs. “Our new missile integration facility is a factory of the future, designed to affordably produce high quantities of missiles to meet increasing customer demand,” said Mary Petryszyn, corporate vice president and president, Northrop Grumman Defense Systems. The facility won’t be limited to producing one type of missile but will be able to adapt manufacturing techniques to quickly pivot as demands change, the company said in a statement. Construction on the new facility is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Local health officers can unilaterally issue orders to slow diseases, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a decision upholding contentious orders limiting indoor gatherings and mandating masks that Dane County officials handed down during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 4-3 decision affirms that state law grants local health officers the ability to do what they deem necessary to stop communicable diseases without oversight from governing bodies such as city councils and county boards. Liberal-leaning Justice Jill Karofsky wrote for the majority that Wisconsin law clearly authorizes public health officers to issue such orders and has since the state was a territory. She added that if local elected officials don’t like the orders, they can remove the health officer, creating a strong safeguard for the people. “Today’s ruling is a win for every resident of our community,” Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said. “This ruling ensures that our public health department will have the ability to keep our community safe – and that decision making will remain science-based.” The ruling marks the culmination of a lawsuit two parents filed in Dane County in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A 24-hour fundraising campaign Wednesday will allow people to donate to more than 250 different nonprofits around the state through one online portal. WyoGives, an annual event begun in 2019 by the Wyoming Nonprofit Network, aims to amplify fundraising efforts and centralize access to donations, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Donors can look up the mission and other information of various organizations through wyogives.org, where they can search by cause, location and other information.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/03/17/national-police-association-says-its-helping-police-chiefs-say-its-scam/3144585002/", "title": "National Police Association says it's helping police. Chiefs say it's a ...", "text": "An elderly man in Trenton, Michigan, received a dire letter that warned about the \"greatest threats to our public safety in our nation's history.\"\n\nThe solution, the letter says, is clear: “Give our law enforcement officers the crime prevention tools they need.” A donation of $10, $15 or $25 would help keep communities like Trenton safe.\n\nDonations, however, aren’t directed to the Trenton Police Department — or typically any other police agency, for that matter. Instead, the money makes its way to a new nonprofit based in Indianapolis.\n\nAt least four police departments in four states have found the letters to be confusing and misleading enough to issue \"scam alerts\" in their communities. One police chief even reported the operation to a federal postal investigator.\n\n“I’m thinking, ‘What the hell is this, using our name and our police department to raise funds?’” Trenton Police Lt. Mike Hawkins told IndyStar. “Get out of here.”\n\nThe group behind the letters is the National Police Association, a nonprofit that raised more than $100,000 in its first 10 months, according to a 2017 tax filing, largely through letters critics say use fear-mongering language to target vulnerable people.\n\nAnd the president of the National Police Association is a 59-year-old Hamilton County man named Eddie Hutchison, who says he volunteers just a few hours each week to the cause.\n\nBy day? He works for the Indiana attorney general's office as a fraud investigator.\n\nHutchison did not agree to an interview request. But several IndyStar questions sent to Hutchison were answered through a local attorney, Derek R. Peterson, who is listed as the nonprofit's treasurer. Peterson also previously worked for the Indiana attorney general.\n\nWe live here, work here and fight for you. Help us make Central Indiana better.\n\nIndianapolis crime:This condo complex is 'McDonald's for drugs'\n\nPeterson and Hutchison deny any characterization that they’re running a scam. Neither are paid by the organization, according to the tax filing. They say their volunteer activities are separate from their professional lives.\n\nIndiana Attorney General Curtis Hill’s office declined an interview request. When presented with a list of questions, including whether Hill found the scam accusations against the National Police Association to be problematic, Hill's spokesman Chris Proffitt issued a brief statement: “Our office has no association with the National Police Association, nor did we have prior knowledge of the employee’s association with this group.”\n\nAt a time of overheated political rhetoric, the National Police Association is hauling in money and gaining attention by leaning into culture wars. In fundraising letters, it paints a dystopian picture of communities and police departments under attack. In press releases and legal filings, it advocates for criminal justice policies.\n\nBeyond Hutchison and Peterson, an IndyStar investigation could only confirm the identity of one other person formally involved with the organization. Another person, who was initially named as a vice president, has denied knowledge of the nonprofit. Two other names included in documents tied to the National Police Association could not be found by IndyStar.\n\nHutchison has an eclectic background, including a brief congressional run in the 1990s, guest spots on talk radio and past jobs in the sport of boxing and operating USA Dream Girl, a model search website that displayed photographs of scantily-clad women and then asked users to rate their appearances. In 2016, according to his bankruptcy filing that year, Hutchison owed more than $13,000 in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service dating back 10 years.\n\nThe National Police Association, which was formed in 2017, is not a membership organization. Its only physical presence is a P.O. Box in Indianapolis. With no paid staff, the nonprofit is run by three volunteers.\n\nYet despite his nonprofit's infancy and small size, Hutchison has pushed his nascent organization into national conversations by advocating for conservative criminal justice policies alongside more established law enforcement groups — at times, appearing to benefit from a name that sounds official and implies police membership.\n\nThe organization has solicited donations in at least 40 states, Hutchison told an Oregon journalist. Indiana is not one of them, Peterson told IndyStar. Although the fundraising letters promise to direct money toward crime prevention tools, the money typically pays for activities such as urging a boycott of Nike over Colin Kaepernick’s ad campaign and filing a court document in support of the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.\n\nIf the National Police Association's objectives are political, Peterson said so too is the reason for the backlash by police chiefs against the organization.\n\n“The NPA is well-aware that there are many individuals in and around law enforcement, who take positions contrary to the educational and advocacy efforts of the NPA,” Peterson wrote in a statement.\n\n'It's a scam'\n\nThe National Police Association's fundraising letters raise different issues depending on the city.\n\nFundraising letters in Germantown, Wisconsin, last year falsely warned that Germantown is a sanctuary city, a term that refers to states and municipalities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n\"Countless Americans have already been robbed, mugged, raped and even murdered as a direct result of Sanctuary policies of allowing known criminals to remain on the streets,\" one copy of a National Police Association letter says, adding, \"your gift of $15 is needed to reach citizens like you ... so they realize the kind of risks they're facing because their elected officials have allowed their communities to become sanctuaries for violent criminals.\"\n\nGermantown Police Chief Peter Hoell told IndyStar the group “must not have researched the demographics.”\n\n“It’s so far-fetched, especially if you know Germantown,” Hoell said of the sanctuary city claim. “It’s a highly conservative community.”\n\nHoell told residents to disregard the letter. He also reported the National Police Association to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service over what he considered to be fraudulent mail.\n\n“It’s a scam,” Hoel said. “It’s no different than any other scam — just a different angle.”\n\nHoell said he typically does not receive updates after reporting fraudulent mail so it's unclear what the status of any investigation might be.\n\nIn response to questions from IndyStar, the National Police Association insisted it does not misrepresent itself. The nonprofit, which first incorporated in Delaware and then registered in Indiana, also said it does not raise money or advocate for policy positions in Indiana.\n\n\"The NPA utilizes a third-party company to conduct fundraising,\" Peterson said. \"The NPA has been advised that through the third-party fundraising company, the NPA does not solicit funds on behalf of local police departments.\"\n\nThe National Police Association outsources its fundraising to Virginia-based Direct Response Consulting Services, a company formerly known as Watson & Hughey. The fundraising company changed its name in the early 1990s after a scandal in which it collected millions of dollars for a defunct Carmel organization, the United Cancer Council, which had its nonprofit status revoked by the IRS, according to The NonProfit Times, a trade publication.\n\nDirect Response Consulting Services declined to comment on the record regarding its fundraising letters on behalf of the National Police Association.\n\nPeterson said both the fundraising company and the National Police Association comply with the law. Peterson dismissed as unfair and unsubstantiated allegations from police departments that the National Police Association's fundraising letters used scam tactics.\n\n“The Police Chiefs that you refer to have not made those assertions to the NPA,” Peterson said. “The NPA does not know the basis of such alleged comments, nor the context of such comments. Further, the NPA is reasonably certain that if you asked them whether they had contacted the NPA (to) express any such concerns, there (sic) response would have been ‘no.’”\n\nThat's not true, said Laura Houston, the chief of the Belle Isle Police Department in Florida. When people in her community started receiving mail that claimed they lived in a sanctuary city, Houston said she called the phone number listed on the National Police Association’s website and left a voicemail message. She said she did not hear back.\n\nHouston, noting that her city has a large population of elderly residents, said the letter was crafted as “pleas to those who are easily preyed upon.” Belle Isle on March 6 posted a message to Facebook telling residents that “Belle Isle is not a sanctuary city and efforts to contact the National Police Association have been unsuccessful.”\n\n“I can’t substantiate that this is a legitimate organization and the fact that it announces we are a sanctuary city, and we’re not, that is enough for me to recommend our residents not send something out,” Houston told IndyStar.\n\nWhen asked by IndyStar to provide names of police officers who could say how the nonprofit helped them, the National Police Association gave one example.\n\nRichard Bennett, a sheriff's deputy in Dane County, Wisconsin, told IndyStar he was running low on safety brochures that he hands out at community events. He found the National Police Association's website through Google and sent an email to see if the nonprofit could help him out.\n\n“We got like 3,000 brochures from them,” Bennett said. “There was no money exchanged. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was. On my end, I can say it worked out nicely.”\n\nWhile the National Police Association said it generally does not donate to police departments, Peterson highlighted that interaction — and the estimated cost of $1,000 — to show how it can support law enforcement.\n\nReporting this story took time. Support reporters who bring you news that matters.\n\n'Where's the rest of the money going?'\n\nThe National Police Association spent more than $217,000 in its first year, according to its 990 tax document in 2017 — which is more than twice as much as it received in donations.\n\nFundraising expenses alone totaled nearly $107,000. All of its revenue — $103,000 — resulted from donations collected through Direct Response Consulting Services' national letter campaign.\n\nJamie Levine Daniel, a nonprofit management professor who reviewed the tax document for IndyStar, said it's difficult to assess a nonprofit's spending behavior using only one year of information.\n\nBut one thing about the National Police Association's tax document stood out: Only 25 percent of the group's spending went to programming. A number that low, she said, raises questions about why an organization isn’t spending more money on its core mission.\n\n“I’m not going to tell you what the right number is, because I don’t know,” said Levine Daniel, a professor at the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. “But 25 percent is not a great look. And it makes me say, ‘Where’s the rest of the money going?’”\n\nPeterson said the National Police Association is paying for attorneys, media communications and fundraising.\n\n“I am not surprised that they have a deficit — that their numbers on the surface don’t look that great — because it is the first year of operation,” Levine Daniel said. “So, I’d hesitate to label or classify the organization based on the numbers.”\n\nPeterson made a similar point in response to IndyStar’s question about the National Police Association’s low spending on program activities.\n\n“It is the NPA’s understanding that it takes time to come by repeat donors,” he said.\n\n“It is the participation of repeat donors that lowers the fundraising expense.”\n\nListed VP hadn't heard of organization\n\nFred Berns does not recall agreeing to become an officer for the National Police Association.\n\nBerns, 79, a former boxing promoter, was listed as vice president in a July 2017 filing with the state. Berns told The Baltimore Sun he knew Hutchison, but was not familiar with his latest venture.\n\n“He’s always got something going like that,” Berns told The Sun. “He’s a pretty bright kid.”\n\nHutchison said in a statement to IndyStar that he approached Berns about joining the organization in 2017, but soon after “there were other events whereby it was determined it wasn't for the best.”\n\nBerns did not respond to three IndyStar phone calls and one voicemail seeking comment.\n\nBerns is among three names that show up in National Police Association documents and correspondence whose official roles with the organization could not be verified by IndyStar.\n\nUntil recently, the National Police Association listed a treasurer named Arnold Musungu, whose name is also spelled as Munsungu in some filings. Its press releases include a contact for Adam Colton, a name that has appeared on statements relating to Hutchison’s businesses dating back to at least 2003, when he was listed as a media contact in a press release announcing the monthly winner of a USA Dream Girl model search.\n\nIndyStar could not find records for anyone with Colton's or Musungu's names who might have a role with the National Police Association.\n\nThe National Police Association provided IndyStar with contact information for Berns and Brad Shaw, who is listed as the organization’s secretary. But, in response to questions about the existence of Colton and Musungu, the nonprofit declined to offer details that would help locate them.\n\nHutchison said he would “reach out to Adam Colton.” Peterson added, “Arnold Musungu was replaced as treasurer” by himself.\n\nMedia fuels the National Police Association's rise\n\nThe National Police Association has quickly succeeded at positioning itself as an expert representing the views of law enforcement.\n\nThe National Police Association is the latest venture for a founder who has spent more than two decades honing his media skills. Hutchison's background includes providing radio commentary and publishing a political newsletter called the Indiana Conservatives’ Letter.\n\n“I find the Republican party to be more supportive of law enforcement than other parties,” Hutchison said in response to a question about how his past prepared him to run the National Police Association.\n\nNow, armed with a trustworthy name while serving a hungry media, the National Police Association has filled a news vacuum with everything from tips on staying safe during the holidays to commenting on criminal justice issues — all the while raising donations with the implication it's directly supporting local police.\n\nInstead, the National Police Association is focused on sending fiery press releases, filing friend-of-the-court briefs and submitting statements through social media that dive into hot-button political issues, such as saying the ACLU consists of “activists who represent cop killers.”\n\nThe group started a Change.org petition and created its first political Facebook ad to urge people to boycott Nike over the company's ad featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick famously knelt during the playing of the national anthem to protest what he considered police injustice.\n\nThe National Police Association's tactics appear to be working.\n\nIn April 2018, The Cincinnati Enquirer called it a \"national police group\" and quoted from a statement in a nine-paragraph story about a man accused of shooting at police officers.\n\nIn December 2018, the Boston Herald and an NBC affiliate devoted articles to the group's complaint against a progressive prosecutor, Rachael Rollins, who pledged not to charge people for actions such as drug possession or resisting arrest.\n\nLast month, The Baltimore Sun wrote about the group's letter urging President Donald Trump to water down a federal consent decree in the city.\n\nBut it's not just the media that have given the National Police Association an elevated status in the law enforcement world.\n\nThe established National Sheriffs’ Association, whose president is former Marion County Sheriff John Layton, teamed with the National Police Association and two other organizations last September. Together, they filed an amicus brief opposing California’s sanctuary state law.\n\nPatrick Royal, a National Sheriffs' Association spokesman, told IndyStar he did not know how the National Police Association joined the brief.\n\n\"You're used to the other guys,\" Royal said, referring to well-known groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Fraternal Order of Police. “It’s not a great excuse, but there’s a lot of people on (the brief) and someone maybe got (Hutchison) to sign on.”\n\nAlthough the National Police Association has been portrayed as an expert on criminal justice policy and as an advocate for local law enforcement, it is virtually unknown to police officials.\n\nPolice organizations in the nonprofit's hometown — the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Marion County Sheriff's Office and Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police — told IndyStar they've never heard of it.\n\nNeither had the leader of the national FOP when contacted by the Baltimore Sun last month.\n\nNor had Todd Scheffler, the police chief in Trenton, Michigan.\n\nAmid all the questions about what the National Police Association does, Scheffler knows what it doesn’t do: give money to his police department.\n\n“People think they’re doing something beneficial to the community (by donating) and the community doesn’t see any benefit from this,” Scheffler said. “They’re just giving money to somebody. We don’t know who this is. It comes back to a P.O. Box.”\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Ryan Martin at 317-444-6294 or ryan.martin@indystar.com.

The school is trying to raise $2 million total. Any proceeds will also go to improve the campus, restore the school’s athletics program and establish an endowment fund. President Alvin Cleveland said the private school wasn’t recertified for the Federal Student Financial Assistance Program because of inadequate paperwork and incomplete files, so it’s being required to pay back financial aid. Selma University is affiliated with the Alabama State Missionary Baptist Convention. Another small, church-affiliated school in Selma, Concordia College, closed last year amid declining enrollment and financial problems.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: An accidental release of a smelly nontoxic chemical commonly added to propane and natural gas to give them a fragrance that can be detected caused multiple people to report a gas leak in downtown Fairbanks. The city said there was no gas leak or fire hazard. The owner of C&R Pipe and Steel Inc., Dennis Wilfer, said the chemical was mixed with water inside an unmarked cylinder that had been dropped off at his business for recycling. As workers sorted the metal, mercaptan leaked out, releasing a foul odor that moved north into downtown Fairbanks. City officials said the Fairbanks Fire Department responded to reports of a possible gas leak. The city confirms there was no gas leak or fire hazard.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Republic reported that the new downtown nightclub Track Club has closed less than a month after opening, according to a statement posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday afternoon. The post notified fans of the immediate closure and included instructions for what to do if you bought tickets for an upcoming show at the venue. Track Club was a collaboration between Phoenix developer Charles “Chuckie” Duff, Relentless Beats music promoter Thomas Turner and Rattle and Rum cocktail master Damon Scott. Duff, known for his adaptive reuse projects around Phoenix, oversaw the development and remodeling of DeSoto Central Market, transforming the space into a music venue complete with a full stage and multiple bars. Turner took the reigns for the music, scheduling EDM DJs to perform at the new nightclub. Scott designed cocktails for inside the music venue and more complex craft drinks for the outer bar area. The partners did not respond to request for comment before publication.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:The city will continue to levy 2.0 mills on real estate and personal property, the City Council decided Monday night. Council members on Oct. 17 voted to keep the city’s general millage at 2.0 mills for next year, but then later that meeting expressed an interest in revisiting the topic. The city’s millage rate was one of three topics scheduled to be discussed at Monday night’s meeting. All cities in Baxter County – and most in the state of Arkansas – levy a millage against real estate and personal property. That millage is collected by the county tax collector’s office when residents pay their property taxes and goes toward that city’s General Fund for various city expenses. During Monday night’s meeting, council member Jennifer Baker made the motion to raise the millage. The city is struggling with how to pay for a 23% increase in its health insurance premium. The city will need an additional $400,000 in 2020 to cover the rise in its health insurance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLake Elsinore:A small earthquake rattled the Lake Elsinore area on Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake struck at 2:44 a.m. with a magnitude of 3.0 at a depth of 5.6 miles. Its epicenter was 6.5 miles west-northwest of Lake Elsinore and about 7 miles northwest of Lakeland Village, according to data from the USGS.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Most school districts in the Denver and Colorado Springs area canceled classes Wednesday, a day after many of them sent home students early because of snow. The weather shut down a stretch of Interstate 70 east of Denver International Airport but it reopened early Wednesday. The snowy weather has been accompanied by cold temperatures. Denver broke a record for the lowest maximum temperature for Tuesday by reaching 18 degrees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: A New England aquarium beloved for its beluga whales is hoping to get five more of the marine mammals as part of a research project. Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut is home to the largest outdoor beluga whale habitat in the country. Three of the whales live in the habitat. The aquarium said it’s awaiting approval from the federal government for the transfer of five belugas that were born at a facility in Canada. Stephen Coan, president of Sea Research Foundation, said the whales would become part of a research program designed to increase general knowledge about the species and inform conservation efforts. The foundation operates the aquarium. Belugas are white whales that can weigh up to 3,500 pounds. Some of their populations are considered endangered.\n\nDelaware\n\nSlaughter Beach: Officials said three homes near the coast were heavily damaged in an accidental fire. News outlets reported the State Fire Marshal’s Office said an outdoor generator sparked the flames that burned the houses Wednesday afternoon in Slaughter Beach. Delaware Assistant State Fire Marshal Michael Chionchio said the damage is estimated at $800,000. No injuries were reported. The town doesn’t have fire hydrants. Mayor Harry Ward said 11 fire companies responded to help douse the flames. The fire happened on the same street where flames erupted on Christmas night in 2017 and destroyed at least two homes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The U.S. Air Force sent a letter to Balfour-Beatty Communities, one of the private companies that manage military housing, to demand an improvement plan, WUSA-TV reported. The letter follows up on issues WUSA-TV has been reporting on for months. Military families told the station they have been living with mold, lead paint and maintenance issues, which create safety concerns. The Air Force is requiring Balfour-Beatty to submit a comprehensive improvement plan by the end of the year. The letter goes on to detail the consequences if the Air Force does not see “prompt and substantial improvement.” WUSA-TV contacted a spokesperson for Balfour-Beatty Communities, which has its headquarters in Philadelphia, who said, “The company is redoubling its efforts to address the issues raised in the letter. We are committed to ensuring that the housing we provide to all of our residents is of a high standard. We are taking a number of steps to address maintenance concerns, including hiring specialists to provide additional oversight, training our people on best customer service practices, and hiring more maintenance and quality control experts. Balfour Beatty Communities is working directly with Air Force representatives to ensure their expectations are met.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A Bengal tiger has died at Busch Gardens after getting into an “atypical altercation” with its brother. The park announced Bala’s death in a statement Tuesday. Officials said a necropsy was being completed. Siblings Bala and Bhutan had lived in the park since 2007. Park spokeswoman Rebecca Romzek said Bhutan isn’t being treated for injuries, but they are closely checking him. The Tampa Bay Times reported eight tigers live at Busch Gardens and they rotate on and off in the park’s Jungala habitat where visitors can see them. Bala was known as the “redhead” of the park’s tigers. She had a strawberry white/blonde coloration, which is caused by a gene mutation that makes the tiger’s striping paler than usual.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Wildlife officials used a bulldozer to help rescue a manatee that got stuck in sand near Savannah. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources said the manatee was navigating a manmade shortcut between rivers near Savannah on Oct. 1 when it got stranded at low tide. That’s because the cut is being filled by the Army Corps of Engineers to create wetlands. The state agency posted a video online that showed wildlife workers keeping the manatee wet until a bulldozer plowed a trench that allowed river water to reach the animal. Workers then rolled the manatee onto a stretcher and guided it to deeper water. Manatees are protected as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They pass through Georgia waters on their way to Florida for the winter.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Federal geologists are examining samples of water from a growing pond in a Hawaii volcano’s crater. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory used a drone to collect water samples from a growing lake in Kilauea volcano’s crater, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. They will test the water’s chemistry to find out more about its origin and how much it is interacting with volcanic gases that come from deep magma. Geologists confirmed the presence of the water in the bottom of Halemaumau crater this summer. It is the first time in recorded history that water has appeared in the crater. Kilauea had a major eruption last year that caused the collapse of the crater to below the water table. Patricia Nadeau, a research geologist with HVO, said there has always been groundwater near the Kilauea summit but it had never reached the surface. Besides confirming that the water is not rain pooling in the crater, its composition can also tell researchers more about what’s happening deep underground where the volcano’s magma is.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal lawsuit challenging Idaho’s ballot initiative process as unconstitutional because it requires signatures from multiple legislative districts has been dismissed. Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye ruled Tuesday that Ryan Isbelle lacked standing to bring the lawsuit but didn’t rule on the merits of the case. Nye said Isbelle lacked standing because he hadn’t tried to get an initiative on the ballot. Nye didn’t rule on Isbelle’s claim that Idaho’s initiative rules violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Isbelle argued that an Idaho law passed in 2013 requiring signatures from 6% of registered voters in 18 legislative districts was unconstitutional. Before 2013, ballot initiatives required signatures from 6% of statewide registered voters. Isbelle argued the change unconstitutionally gave more weight to signatures in some districts.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: It was a real dog of a ceremony this week during a swearing-in at the state’s attorney’s office in Chicago. The newly sworn-in worker is a Labrador retriever named Hatty. The 2-year-old will ease the strain of criminal proceedings on young children and those with mental-health issues who have been victims of assault. She will handle up to 200 cases annually. Hatty is the office’s first emotional-support dog and was trained partly by inmates. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx presided over Tuesday’s swearing-in. Hatty stood on her hind legs over a table and placed her paw across a law book as an oath was administered.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:State officials are suspending work requirements for low-income residents who receive their health insurance through Medicaid while a federal lawsuit challenging the plan is sorted out. The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said it won’t be enforcing rules that require those not qualifying for exemptions to report 20 hours a month of work or related activity or face coverage loss after Dec. 31. The move comes after a lawsuit was filed in September against Indiana’s plan. Federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from allowing similar work requirements for Arkansas and Kentucky. Attorneys for Medicaid recipients said Congress intended medical care as the Medicaid program’s goal, and the Trump administration failed to account for potential coverage losses for thousands of people from work requirements.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: Some Iowa State students are pressuring the university administration to take action against people who have scrawled anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi slogans on campus. Dozens of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon at university President Wendy Wintersteen’s office to push their goal of a zero-tolerance university policy toward racism and anti-Semitism. Protest organizers said “Heil Hitler,” “no trans rights” and anti-Semitic slogans were written in chalk at various places on the campus last week. The Des Moines Register reported that posters and stickers advocating white nationalist viewpoints have been found on campus since 2016. Wintersteen spoke to a couple of the protest organizers and later emailed a statement that said she was proud of the students “for standing up against bigotry and racism.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Topeka Zoo officials said a 30-year-old Malayan sun bear was euthanized after suffering from several age-related medical conditions. The female bear, called Cup Cake, was euthanized Monday. She and a bear called Ho Ho came to the zoo in 2017 after their exhibit at a previous zoo was closed for construction. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said both bears were elderly when they arrived in Topeka and zoo officials anticipated they would not live long. He said they were kept in an area with keepers who specialized in working with geriatric animals. Cup Cake began limping on Saturday and her hind legs were useless by Sunday. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported the decision was made to euthanize Cup Cake when she developed head tremors Monday morning.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Distillers’ Association said distilleries filled more than 2.1 million barrels of bourbon in 2018. The state’s inventory of aging spirits reached 9.1 million barrels, mostly bourbon. The group said both figures are modern-era records. It’s the highest inventory in the 52 years that records have been kept. It’s also the only time since 1967 that Kentucky distillers filled more than 2 million barrels. The association said the figures came from Kentucky Department of Revenue data. Despite the continuing surge, the group said trade disputes and tariffs pose an industry threat. The association said Kentucky bourbon exports to European Union countries – the industry’s largest market – have plummeted through August, compared to the same time last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A Louisiana appeals court has overruled a judge who said prosecutors could not use the word “rape” during a man’s rape trial. In a ruling filed Wednesday, Judge Ben Willard in New Orleans granted a defense request to bar prosecutors and prosecution witnesses from using the word rape in an ongoing trial. Prosecutors appealed, noting the defendant faces multiple charges, including first-degree rape. A three-judge panel of Louisiana’s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that Willard was wrong to ban the use of the word rape by prosecutors. It’s unknown why attorneys with the New Orleans Public Defenders office made the request. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Willard did not spell out his reasoning in a filing with the appellate court.\n\nMaine\n\nArundel: A report from the Maine Center for Disease Control found PFAS chemical contamination in nearly half the public water supplies tested. The agency had 19 water supplies tested because of their proximity to potential sources of PFAS contamination, such as airports, landfills and paper mills. PFAS chemicals, which are sometimes described as “forever chemicals,” were found in nine of the water supplies. Maine CDC provided its report on Tuesday to a PFAS task force organized by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. PFAS chemicals were found in towns including Arundel, Georgetown and Topsham. Maine CDC’s summary of the findings said a high percentage of water systems declined to take part. A Maine CDC spokesperson said the data is evidence for mandatory monitoring for the chemicals in community water systems.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: A community service agency has come to the rescue of a deaf Maryland woman who faced a nearly $5,000 water bill because she couldn’t hear her toilet running. The Frederick News-Post reported the Frederick Community Action Agency stepped in Tuesday to help cover Denise Sansonese’s bill. Agency Assistant Director of Community Services Brad Peterson said it wants the city to reduce the bill by any amount and will do what’s necessary to take the balance down to zero if that doesn’t happen. Blake Sansonese said his mother went to the city to address the bill but was told there wasn’t an interpreter available to help her. Denise Sansonese said she never saw a letter city left on her door about the bill.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSpringfield: An MGM dealer said the casino has been paying him less than minimum wage and shorting overtime pay. Shawn Connors, of Uncasville, Connecticut, filed a complaint Monday in U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, alleging that he is entitled to more than the wage MGM Springfield has been paying. The Boston Globe reported Connors began working at the casino last summer, shortly before it opened. Connors said he should be paid more than the approximately $5 per hour rate he has been paid because he also receives tips. He added MGM never notified him that he would earn such a low basic wage, as is required by law. The lawsuit also claimed the casino underpaid tipped employees who worked overtime. An MGM spokesman said they have received the filing and will “respond accordingly.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: State environmental regulators are promising faster reviews of applications to protect homes or structures threatened by rising Great Lakes levels. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said Wednesday it will expedite permits for actions such as placing rocks or building seawalls to prevent erosion. Director Liesl Clark said permit consideration requires a balance between protecting property and safeguarding environmental features such as dunes, shorelines and bluffs. She said excessive or poorly designed shoreline protection structures can disrupt natural processes and damage neighboring properties. It usually takes 60 to 90 days to process shoreline permits. EGLE said it will act much faster where homes or infrastructure are at risk. The number of shoreline protection permits granted has risen sharply in recent years. In many cases, permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also are required for placing materials along the water.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A plan to dispose of deer carcasses during Minnesota’s upcoming rifle hunting season is unraveling over a waste hauler’s fears of spreading chronic wasting disease. The state placed special dumpsters in parts of central and southeastern Minnesota where the fatal deer brain disease has been found. The plan was to use the containers to safely dispose of potentially infected deer carcasses. But Waste Management will not accept deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting or that have the potential of being infected. With Minnesota’s rifle season about to start, officials are worried hunters will toss bones onto the land where the disease can spread to other deer. Officials of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources told state lawmakers Tuesday that Waste Management does not want to be held liable if the infectious material that causes chronic wasting spreads into the wild, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Waste Management spokeswoman Julie Ketchum told the Associated Press that the waste disposal company will handle any deer carcasses already in the dumpsters. But Waste Management is concerned about the prions, a misshaped protein that causes the disease in deer and elk and remains infectious in the environment for years, Ketchum said. The DNR has had difficulty convincing landfills to take potentially infected deer, MPR reported. Chronic wasting is still rare in Minnesota, but its potential spread is a worry for state conservation officials who oversee Minnesota’s $1 billion annual deer-hunting industry.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Construction will begin next year for a veterans’ nursing home near the Gulf Coast. The 100-bed facility will be in the Tradition development north of Gulfport. News outlets reported that the executive director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board, Stacey Pickering, spoke at a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday. He said the state has 189,000 veterans and 26% of them live in the three coastal counties. The closest veterans’ home to the coast is in Collins, about 2 hours away. Pickering said the state Legislature agreed to provide $16 million to go with a federal grant of $29.3 million to build the center.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it has signed a lease for permanent office space at a building in downtown Kansas City for two of its research agencies. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a news release Thursday that signing the lease is an important next step for the agencies’ efficiency, effectiveness and service to customers. The USDA announced plans in June to move roughly 550 employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture by the end of September to the Kansas City area. The announcement of the new office space comes amid charges from a federal employees union that the move has left them critically understaffed, saying it will take years to hire replacements for the highly specialized positions.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: With snow on the ground in Montana, fire agencies from across the state are sending 20 engines and 72 firefighters to California to help battle wildfires there. Gov. Steve Bullock approved sending crews as part of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. About 18 agencies are sending personnel and equipment for 14-day deployments. Flathead County Fire Services Manager Lincoln Chute and Helena firefighter Owen Koeppen said the work will allow Montana firefighters to gain experience, knowledge and skills they can use at home. Helena Assistant Fire Chief Mike Chambers said six firefighters are going to California and the rest of the department will fill in and maybe work some overtime to cover shifts. Blazes fanned by strong winds are burning in northern and southern California, destroying homes and threatening others, forcing thousands of people to evacuate\n\nNebraska\n\nMaxwell: The Nebraska State Patrol said troopers have seized 91 pounds of marijuana found in a sport utility vehicle during a traffic stop on Interstate 80 near Maxwell. The patrol said the stop happened Tuesday night when the driver of the SUV was pulled over on suspicion of having an obscured license plate. During the stop, a police drug dog indicated the presence of drugs in the vehicle, and a search turned up the marijuana, which was concealed in bags in the SUV’s cargo area. The 36-year-old driver and 61-year-old passenger, both from Kansas City, Missouri, were arrested, as was a 34-year-old passenger from Mexico, on suspicion of various drug violations.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists are suing the Trump administration to try to block mining exploration in Nevada they said would wipe out the only known population of a desert wildflower. The Center for Biological Diversity filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this month to list Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species. The new lawsuit accuses the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations requiring a formal environmental review and public comment on any land disturbances larger than 5 acres. BLM lists one of the exploration projects as 4.98 acres and the other as 4.04 acres in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County about 120 miles southeast of Reno, where a lithium and boron mine is planned. Bureau spokesman Rudy Evenson said the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation. But he said it “takes the protection of this species seriously and is committed to the deliberate process to ensure it is protected.” The delicate wildflower – typically about 2 feet tall with white to cream to yellow blooms – plays an integral role in the desert ecosystem by stabilizing soils and dispersing seeds, the lawsuit said. The estimated 20,000 to 43,000 individual plants that remain are found only in specific soil conditions on 21 acres spread across 3 square miles of Nevada in a narrow elevation band between 5,960 and 6,200 feet, according to the petition filed Oct. 7 seeking protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A watchdog report based on a review of child fatalities called on New Hampshire’s child protection agency to address systemic problems, including an outdated filing system, strained relationships with other agencies and internal biases among staff members. The Office of the Child Advocate was created in 2017 as part of a larger effort to reform the state’s Division of Children, Youth and Families. It released a report this week based on a monthslong review of six cases that focused not on the actions of particular individuals, but rather the environment in which they occurred. Child Advocate Moira O’Neill said the goal is to shift from “blame and shame” to system accountability. DCYF officials noted the report raises several long-standing issues that are already are being addressed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Transportation Security Administration agents at Newark Liberty Airport uncovered a more decorative than deadly item when they checked a passenger’s carry-on. Agents on Tuesday thought there was a gun in the bag when they put it through the X-ray machine. However, a closer inspection revealed a gun-shaped toilet paper roller. The realistic replica gun was designed to spin paper instead of bullets. Travelers are not permitted to bring real or replica firearms through security checkpoints. TSA said it gave the man the option to place it in a checked bag, hand it off to a companion or surrender it. He decided to give it to the TSA.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHolloman Air Force Base: The Air Force said a pilot successfully ejected from an F-16 before the fighter crashed in southern New Mexico during a training flight. Holloman Air Force Base officials said the F-16 assigned to the 49th Wing at the base crashed Tuesday night about 80 miles southeast of the base. Officials said in a statement that the pilot was taken to a hospital for treatment, but it did not provide information on any injuries to the pilot, whose identity was not released. The statement said a board of officers will investigate the crash and that its cause wasn’t determined immediately.\n\nNew York\n\nRotterdam: A dog hit by a car in upstate New York rode for 45 minutes wedged between the broken bumper and the grille before the driver realized she was carrying an injured passenger. Coco the Shiba inu was being treated for a fractured elbow after being struck Monday morning in Albany. Rotterdam Police Lt. Jeffrey Collins said the driver knew she hit something and noticed the car’s damage but didn’t see the dog at first. She drove about 15 miles to Rotterdam before hearing noises and stopping to recheck her car’s front end. She called 911 after she saw the dog gazing from below the license plate. A Schenectady veterinary clinic worker told WNYT-TV that 16-pound Coco “fit perfectly” in the space behind the bumper and was lucky to be alive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A gleaming abstract sculpture that’s lit from within will be the centerpiece of a new park honoring the contributions of African Americans to North Carolina that has been in the planning stages for more than a decade. The state Historical Commission approved the new design for Freedom Park on Wednesday. The park will be located on a 1-acre site between the state legislature and the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh. Inspirational quotes from African Americans from North Carolina will be engraved on walls along walkways that lead to the 48-foot-tall Beacon of Freedom sculpture. Plans for the park began in 2002, and an architect was chosen in 2004. But the Great Recession dampened fundraising, and supporters learned that potential donors found the design’s focus on slavery too depressing, board member Reginald Hodges said Wednesday. The design includes no monuments; the walls carry no quotes from people outside North Carolina. The walls will be made of precast concrete and tinted to resemble the red clay of North Carolina, said architect Michael Stevenson of Perkins and Will. One quote located in a prominent place comes from John H. Wheeler, president of Mechanics & Farmers Bank from 1952 to 1978 and a founder of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs: “The battle for freedom begins every morning.” A groundbreaking for the park is planned for December. Stevenson estimated that completing it will take about a year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Water Commission has unveiled a new interactive mapping tool that provides information on potential flooding in the state. State risk map coordinator Laura Horner said the map shows where flooding might occur and to what extent it could happen in various scenarios. The Bismarck Tribune reported that the North Dakota Risk Assessment Mapservice was on display Wednesday at the Bismarck Event Center. The tool is intended to help people make informed decisions about flood protection and provide resources to community leaders who want to keep citizens safe. It uses base-level engineering that combines elevation data with advancements in modeling technology. The state partnered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the project.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringfield: The 178th Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard is set to get its first female commander. Col. Kimberly Fitzgerald is scheduled to assume duties as commander of the 178th Wing from Col. Gregg Hesterman during a ceremony Sunday at the Springfield Air National Guard Base. Fitzgerald is currently the vice commander of the 178th Wing. She has 26 years of service including a total of more than 4,000 flight hours as a KC-135 navigator, a KC-135 pilot, MQ-1 Predator pilot, and MQ-9 Reaper pilot. She transferred to the 178th Wing in 2011 and served as the 162nd Flying Squadron commander and Mission Support Group commander before taking on the role of vice commander. Hesterman will serve as the director of staff for the Ohio National Guard.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma judge on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a Democratic state lawmaker and gun safety advocates to block a new law that will allow most people in the state to carry a firearm in public without a background check or training. Oklahoma County District Judge Don Andrews rejected a request by Oklahoma City Democratic Rep. Jason Lowe for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the “permitless carry” law from taking effect on Friday. Lowe’s attorney, Melanie Rughani, argued that the bill violated the state’s constitutional single-subject rule that requires bills to deal with only one topic. But the judge said Rughani failed to prove that the law taking effect would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. Lowe promised to appeal the judge’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. According to the National Rifle Association, at least 14 states have approved some version of permitless carry.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Wildland firefighters worked to contain blazes across Western Oregon as windy conditions and low humidity gripped the state. KVAL reported strong east winds caused wildfire danger levels to climb, the Coos Forest Protective Association said Wednesday. The agency said southwestern Oregon is experiencing a similar weather pattern as California, where multiple fires have destroyed homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The Coos Forest Protective Association responded to four fires since Sunday, one of which the agency said was power-line related. Firefighters in Lane County have brought two fires that started Tuesday under control. Firefighters also contained a small blaze near Eagle Point on Tuesday. Firefighters continue to work a small fire in Josephine County that started Saturday. Fire crews are also working to control two somewhat larger fires in northwest Oregon east of Molalla and near Detroit. No injuries have been reported and no structures have been reported destroyed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A proposal to allow hunting on three Sundays a year in Pennsylvania is on its way to the state Senate for a final vote. The House voted 144-54 on Wednesday for the bill that would also require a landowner’s written permission. The bill would permit Sunday hunting one day during rifle deer season, one during statewide archery deer season and a third day the Game Commission would select. It also would make it easier for wardens to enforce the anti-trespassing law.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Public utilities regulators said a natural gas outage that affected more than 7,000 customers during a particularly cold spell last winter was caused by low pressure in a pipeline. The 74-page Division of Public Utilities and Carriers report released Wednesday blamed the low pressure on high demand for gas driven by low temperatures; failure of a power system at a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporization facility in Providence; and a malfunctioning valve at a meter station in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The agency said it will oppose any efforts by National Grid to recover the $25 million in costs related to the outage from ratepayers. Thousands of residents of Newport and Middletown went without gas or heat for nearly a week last January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJoint Base Charleston: Melania Trump and Karen Pence traveled to South Carolina on Wednesday to get briefings about some of the military’s emergency preparedness and humanitarian efforts in a state where both are often needed because of active hurricane seasons. During a few hours in and around Joint Base Charleston, where several branches of the military have operations, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence were updated by a handful of agencies, whose officials described how they mobilize federal resources before and after natural disasters. That often means natural disasters in South Carolina, where the coast was evacuated earlier this year as Hurricane Dorian swirled in the Atlantic Ocean. Skirting the Carolina coast just after Labor Day, Dorian’s high winds and rain spun off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles. Earlier, at an elementary school just off the base, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence also met with fifth-grade students participating in the Red Cross Pillowcase Project, which helps children mentally and physically prepare for natural disasters. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence have previously toured military installations together, including North Carolina’s Fort Bragg earlier this year. To close out their South Carolina trip, both women made remarks to several hundred service members and their families on the base, thanking them for serving the country. Mrs. Pence reminded the crowd of the importance of military spouses and families, and Mrs. Trump focused on heralding the strength of the U.S. military.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Authorities have been staking out a cornfield in northern Sioux Falls for more than 24 hours, waiting out a loose, recluse moose that has taken shelter in the field near 60th Street North and Marion Road. \"He kind of disappeared on us. We think he's napping,\" said Julie DeJong, the animal control supervisor. Animal Control responded to the report around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Game, Fish and Parks and South Dakota Highway Patrol also are involved in the situation. There were also reports of a moose in Hartford over the weekend, DeJong said, though she didn't know if this was the same moose. Authorities will continue to monitor the cornfield until the moose comes out, DeJong said. When he does come out, the moose will either wander out of town and authorities will leave it alone or, if it moves closer to Sioux Falls, authorities will try to contain him, sedate him and move him outside of the city. There have been two other instances of a moose on the loose in the Sioux Falls area within recent years. The two were weeks apart in fall 2016 when a female and then a male wandered into Brandon and the Sioux Falls area. October and November are part of the mating season for moose. The moose could have come from northern Minnesota or from North Dakota, DeJong said. For now, the moose is taking its time, likely eating corn in the field, as authorities wait it out, DeJong said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country star and Grammy winner Marty Stuart will be the celebrity guest on the annual CSX Santa Train, which visits towns in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia in November to hand out gifts for families. The holiday train, which has run every year since 1942, makes a dozen stops in three states, starting in Shelby, Kentucky, and ending in Kingsport, Tennessee, on Nov. 23. The train delivers food, toys and winter clothing on the 110-mile trip. Stuart, who was recently prominently featured in Ken Burns’ “Country Music” PBS documentary, has released 18 studio albums. Born in Mississippi, Stuart started his career playing bluegrass with legend Lester Flatt and later in Johnny Cash’s band. He’s also a photographer and is planning to open a music museum in Mississippi.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A woman is accused of spraying blood and urine on security guards and paintings of governors at the state Capitol. According to an affidavit, Amber Lynette Green was arrested Monday after spraying a Texas Department of Public Safety corporal and another employee with “an unknown liquid in a bottle.” Green sprayed the liquid on paintings of governors in the Capitol rotunda before telling the corporal “there was blood and urine in the bottle.” The officer said he could smell urine. The officer tried to arrest Green, but she ran from the Capitol grounds. Department of Public Safety officers arrested her. Green was charged with harassment of a public servant, evading arrest and other counts. She was booked into Travis County Jail. Bail was set at $25,000.\n\nUtah\n\nBrigham City: Officials in a Utah community say they have received “more than a few” complaints about a family’s Halloween display that includes a guillotine chopping off the heads of baby dolls. However, the city attorney for Brigham City, Michael Christiansen, said the display isn’t a public nuisance under the city code even though “it’s distasteful to some.” KUTV-TV reported that In addition to the guillotine, the lawn display also includes a bloody nurse standing over a baby incubator containing angry-looking babies and baby parts. Julie Bawden said her family’s annual Halloween displays are just intended “to be spooky and fun.” Neighbor Claudia Perry said she objects to the display, saying it’s too much. In Perry’s words, “how far are they going to go? And where are we going to stop?”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Officials said a dam previously deemed a public safety hazard has been demolished. The Dunklee Pond Dam in Rutland came down Wednesday. The Rutland Herald reported that the city and state have been looking at removing the dam since at least 2016. In August, city officials said the structure was one bad rainstorm away from complete failure, which would be compounded by the dam’s massive sediment buildup. Houses downstream were evacuated in early 2017 when erosion from a sudden rainstorm triggered fears it might fail. The Board of Alderman declared it a public safety hazard last year. A no-bid contract for emergency measures was approved last week after a dam retaining wall shifted 3 ½ inches following an Oct. 17 storm.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The Virginian-Pilot reported Thursday that a juvenile humpback whale washed up dead on the north end of Virginia Beach. The spot is along the Atlantic Ocean and just south of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The whale might have been the same animal that someone spotted floating near the bay’s mouth earlier in the week. Alexander Costidis of the Virginia Aquarium said the whale was “pretty decomposed.” He said the whale was tossed around in the waves so much that there wasn’t much left inside the animal to test for a cause of death. But he said that a ship strike was unlikely. The mammal was 26 feet long and was probably between 1 and 3 years old.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court said in a split decision that the state cannot be held at fault for an accident that caused the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River to collapse in 2013. A truck carrying an oversized load struck the overhead support beams of the bridge, causing the structure to fall into the water. No one was killed, but three people in two vehicles plunged into the water. The state sued the Canadian trucking company, Mullen Trucking 2005 Ltd. The company countersued, saying the state was partially at fault and should have to pay some of the damages. Mullen Trucking said the state was negligent in issuing a permit for the load and in maintaining the bridge. In a 5-4 decision, the court Thursday pointed to a state law that said vehicle owners or operators must exercise due care in making sure their vehicles can pass under a structure, and that the state can’t be held liable for damages caused by an overheight vehicle. The dissenting justices said the state could not be found liable under that law, but that it still could be at fault if it failed to properly maintain the bridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Regulators said a state-record chain pickerel was caught in Preston County. The Division of Natural Resources said in a news release that Matt Born of Reedsville used an in-line spinner to catch the fish Oct. 13 at Upper Deckers Lake. The fish measured a record 27.87 inches, besting the record of 27.75-inches caught by Steven Demma at Tuckahoe Lake in 2001. The chain pickerel is a member of the pike family.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A large storm system moving through the Midwest delivered some early season snow to much of Wisconsin. As much as 6 inches of snow was expected in the southern part of the state. Forecasters expected lesser amounts elsewhere, including near Lake Michigan. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory Thursday from northeastern Wisconsin to southern counties. Falling snow slowed the morning commute. In Milwaukee County, the interstate system was slick. Temperatures Thursday night were expected to drop to the 20s.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Wildlife managers have authorized 375 permits for this year’s elk hunt at Grand Teton National Park, which begins Saturday. They will allow hunting in an area mainly east of U.S. Highway 89 in the southeast part of Grand Teton in western Wyoming. Hunting in two different portions of the hunt area will end on Nov. 25 and Dec. 8. Hunting typically isn’t allowed in national parks but the 1950 law authorizing Grand Teton allows elk hunting in the park. Park officials call the hunt an “elk reduction program” intended to cull animals in the Jackson elk herd. Hunters must abide by several rules that often don’t apply outside the park. They include requirements to carry bear spray and use nonlead ammunition", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/liz-cheney-donald-trump-2022-election/index.html", "title": "Liz Cheney is already looking beyond 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nLiz Cheney didn’t come right out and say she expects to lose her primary next month. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "Des Moines Register\n\nThe numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly. They appear in our inboxes and on our feeds like clockwork, sandwiched between big box store discounts and emails from friends.\n\n4,706 positive cases one day.\n\n40 deaths another.\n\nOver 400,000 recovered to date.\n\nMore than 6,100 lost.\n\nIn the routine of it all a callus grows, a protection against what these numbers actually stand for — people.\n\nBehind these figures are storytellers and hard workers, Cubs fans and pie bakers, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories.

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/30/mile-challenge-bean-field-ravine-mountain-lion-attack-news-around-states/118483226/", "title": "80-mile challenge, bean field ravine: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s top health official said Friday that he and his colleagues are “intensely frustrated” as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise, a surge he partly attributed to people who have refused to get vaccinated or change their behavior. The state is grappling with an intensive care unit bed shortage, and federal medical teams and mobile morgue units have been sent to hospitals in the South. “We are really in a crisis,” Health Officer Scott Harris said during his Friday briefing. “We’ve said that over and over for several weeks. We need people to understand that you, yourself – if you’re hearing these words – you’re the person who’s going to make a difference. You need to be responsible for your behavior. You need to do what it takes to not continue this situation. I don’t know how much longer we’re going to be able to do this.” Alabama ranks fourth for new cases per capita and continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. “So much of what we’re seeing is preventable,” Harris said. “We’re seeing this because people don’t want to get vaccinated, and they don’t want to change their behavior. They would rather have an argument about masks than have an argument about how we keep our children safe or how do we protect Alabama hospitals. It is very frustrating for all of us.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state last week reported its highest daily number of resident COVID-19 cases so far this year as health officials struggle to keep pace with coronavirus testing and contact tracing and as hospitals juggle a surge in patients with staff shortages and admissions for other conditions. Gov. Mike Dunleavy and members of his administration on Thursday announced plans aimed at increasing staffing to help with COVID-19 cases, including speeding the licensing process for health care workers and seeking federal contracts for more workers, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, said hospital staffing is a concern. Alaska reported 701 resident COVID-19 cases Thursday – one of the highest daily tallies since the start of the pandemic. That number may be lower than the real number of infections, health officials said, because of testing and contact tracing backlogs. According to the state hospital association, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 are nearing pandemic highs. Combined with staff shortages and busy summertime admissions, Alaska’s health care system faces the threat of being overwhelmed, providers and state officials said. Health care providers are deciding which patients get intensive care unit beds and are struggling to transfer severely ill patients elsewhere.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Supreme Court is eliminating the long-standing practice of allowing lawyers in criminal and civil trials in state courts to remove potential jurors without explanation, a move that proponents said would help prevent discrimination in the selection of trial jurors. So-called peremptory challenges will end Jan. 1, under a groundbreaking rule change ordered Tuesday and released Friday by the state’s highest court. In the meantime, a court task force will recommend possible changes to current court rules that also allow opposing sides in trials to ask judges to remove potential jurors for valid reasons such as stated bias or inability to serve, the order said. Peremptory challenges are a hot-button legal issue nationally, as illustrated by jury selection in the trial that resulted in the conviction of a former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death. Robert Chang, a Seattle University law professor, said he believed Arizona’s impending outright elimination of peremptory challenges is believed to be a first such step by a U.S. state, though others such as Washington and California have placed new restrictions on the challenges. “Arizona clearly has gone further,” said Chang, the director of a legal center that endorsed a competing Arizona rule-change proposal to restrict but not eliminate peremptory challenges.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: More than 3,100 active coronavirus cases have been reported in Arkansas public schools among students and employees, according to newly released numbers from the state. Most students returned to the classroom last week, and the majority of public school students attend districts that are requiring masks. Such rules emerged after a judge in Little Rock temporarily blocked a state law that bans mask mandates in schools and public places. The Arkansas Department of Health’s latest report on schools, released Thursday, found 3,102 active cases in 173 school districts in the state. The Bentonville, Springdale, Rogers, Cabot and Fort Smith districts all reported more than 100 active cases among students, faculty and staff. A week ago, the state reported just under 1,800 active cases at schools. Meanwhile, a judge in Lonoke County on Friday ruled against a group of parents who sued to block Cabot schools’ mask requirement. Circuit Judge Barbara Elmore wrote that most of the parents who sued had already received mask exemptions for their children or withdrawn them from the district, so she denied their request to block the requirement. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalabasas: A mountain lion that attacked a 5-year-old boy and dragged the child across his front lawn was shot and killed by a wildlife officer, authorities said Saturday. The 65-pound mountain lion attacked the boy while he was playing near his house Thursday in Calabasas and “dragged him about 45 yards” across the lawn, said Capt. Patrick Foy, a spokesman with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The boy suffered significant traumatic injuries to his head and upper torso but was in stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital, Foy said. “The true hero of this story is his mom because she absolutely saved her son’s life,” Foy said. The mother was inside the house when she heard commotion outside. “She ran out of the house and started punching and striking the mountain lion with her bare hands and got him off her son,” he said. The parents immediately drove the boy to the hospital, where law enforcement was notified of the attack and sent a wildlife officer to the scene. Once at the house, the officer discovered a mountain lion crouching in the bushes with its “ears back and hissing” at him, Foy said. Subsequent DNA tests confirmed that the lion was the one responsible for attacking the child, the wildlife department said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Jurors convicted two former sheriff’s deputies accused of causing the death of an intoxicated man by placing him on his stomach and squeezing him into a van to take him to a detox center. Former Boulder County sheriff’s deputies James O’Brien, 52, and Adam Lunn, 39, were found guilty Friday of manslaughter in the death of Demetrius Shankling, 23, in 2018, the Longmont Times-Call reports. According to an arrest affidavit, they put the 6-foot-tall man, with his hands behind his back, in a compartment that was less than 5 feet long. O’Brien and Lunn had to press on the compartment door to close it, causing Shankling’s leg to get wedged against the inside of the door, the affidavit said. When they reached the detox center the early hours of Sept. 9, 2018, Shankling was unresponsive and not breathing. He died after spending 27 days in a coma, Senior Deputy District Attorney Christian Gardner-Wood said. An autopsy found that Shankling died of suffocation because of his positioning, with alcohol and amphetamine as contributing factors.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s plan for using $110 million in federal pandemic relief funds to reopen K-12 schools for in-person learning, while addressing the effects of lost instructional time last school year and reducing education gaps over the long term, has been approved by the federal government, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday released the remaining $369 million in federal pandemic relief funds for education to the state. With this latest batch, Connecticut will have received approximately $1.1 billion under the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, according to federal figures. The state previously received $737 million in March. When combined with other federal COVID-19 relief funds for education, Connecticut has received roughly $1.7 billion since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Education. “This historic level of funding allows us, as one educational community, to be bold and innovative as we forge our path to a transformative and equitable recovery,” Connecticut Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials are now asking New Castle County residents to “squish on sight” if they see an invasive spotted lanternfly. The county’s population of the bug has surpassed the level for which the Delaware Department of Agriculture recommends reporting, Delaware State News reports. In Kent and Sussex counties, officials are still asking those who spot adult lanternflies to report them for verification. Spotted lanternflies pose a risk to the grape, orchard, nursery and landscape, and hardwood industries, Stephen Hauss, an environmental scientist with the state Department of Agriculture’s Plant Industries Section, told the newspaper. Native to China, India and Vietnam, the insect is about 1 inch long and half an inch wide at rest. Its forewings are gray with black spots, and the hindwings are red with black spots. The insect was first found in North America in 2014. The first one in Delaware was spotted in 2017, Hauss told the newspaper. Between 2018 and 2019, the insect’s numbers took off, especially in New Castle County.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands of voting rights advocates rallied across the country Saturday to call for sweeping federal laws that would wipe out voting restrictions advancing in some GOP-controlled states that could make it harder to cast a ballot. The rallies, held in dozens of cities, were intended to increase pressure on Democrats to rewrite procedural rules that would allow Democrats to pass the legislation without Republican votes. But they were also aimed at coaxing President Joe Biden to become a more forceful advocate on the issue. “You said the night you won that Black America had your back and that you were going to have Black Americans’ backs,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, who helped organize the national demonstrations, said at a rally in Washington. “Well, Mr. President, they’re stabbing us in the back.” More than a thousand people turned out in sweltering heat on the National Mall on Saturday, the 58th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. His son Martin Luther King III used the occasion to call on the Senate to scrap the filibuster rule. “Our country is backsliding to the unconscionable days of Jim Crow. And some of our senators are saying, ‘Well, we can’t overcome the filibuster,’ ” King told the crowd. “I say to you today: Get rid of the filibuster. That is a monument to white supremacy we must tear down.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Mounting deaths from the latest COVID-19 surge have strained capacity at hospital morgues and funeral homes across central Florida. While the state’s record levels of new cases and hospitalizations for the disease have leveled off over the past week, averages of daily reported deaths have continued to climb. Hospitals across Florida have reported to the federal government that roughly 279 patients have died every day for the past week, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, though that figure includes deaths suspected, but not yet confirmed, to have been from COVID-19. The figure just a month ago was 52 deaths per day. AdventHealth’s hospitals in central Florida are scrambling to secure additional resources to deal with the surge in deaths, said the hospital group’s spokesperson, Jeff Granger. The Orlando Sentinel reports the health system had reached morgue capacity at 10 of its hospitals in five counties: Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole and Volusia. “We have begun utilizing rented, refrigerated coolers at 10 of our campuses,” the hospital group said in an email obtained by the newspaper. “These coolers are quickly becoming filled also.” Funeral directors also warned that their facilities are being overwhelmed, according to numerous news outlets.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court’s ruling that said requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications does not amount to an unconstitutional poll tax. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter filed a lawsuit in April 2020 saying that Georgia’s postage requirement for absentee ballots and ballot applications effectively imposes a poll tax and is therefore unconstitutional. The challenge was brought on behalf of voters and a group seeking to empower communities of color, the Black Voters Matter Fund. “We hold that the fact that absentee voters in Georgia who decide to vote by mail must pay their own postage is not a ‘tax’ or unconstitutional fee on voting,” Circuit Judge Elizabeth Branch wrote in the opinion for a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That affirmed an August 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta. “We are disappointed in the outcome. The ACLU of Georgia will continue to protect the sacred fundamental right to vote,” ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. Totenberg had acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during the pandemic, but said the fact that it’s available means the postage requirement is not tantamount to an unconstitutional poll tax.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: In an effort to address vaccine hesitancy, a group of businesses and nonprofits launched a public service campaign Thursday aimed at Native Hawaiians, many of whom harbor a deep distrust of the government dating back to the U.S.-supported overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. The campaign reminds Hawaiians that they were nearly wiped out by disease in the 1800s and that the kingdom’s rulers at the time pushed people to get vaccinated against smallpox. About 20 Hawaiian leaders stood in rows 6 feet apart Thursday at a statue of Queen Lili’uokalani, the kingdom’s last monarch, imploring people to wear masks and get vaccinated to ensure the survival of the Indigenous people of Hawaii. Meanwhile, as visitors continue to fly to Hawaii and locals go about their business, state officials say the islands may need to go into lockdown if the surge in coronavirus cases linked to the delta variant continues. County mayors are asking for more restrictions, and Gov. David Ige told Hawaii News Now on Thursday that strict mandates are being considered. If case counts continue to rise, “and we push the hospitals across that line, then we will have to go to more extreme measures, lockdowns and potentially shutting businesses,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has been ordered to turn over several public documents regarding her education task force to journalists after a judge found she had no legitimate reason to withhold the materials. In a scathing ruling Thursday, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler said McGeachin’s attempts at withholding the documents from public view were so baseless and frivolous that her office should pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees plus an additional $750 penalty. “If public officials were required to disclose public records only to those, including media, they believe will support the government’s actions, we will have shed the principals of our democracy and evolved into an autocratic state where criticism of public officials is not permitted,” Hippler wrote. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July, after several journalists said they were wrongly denied access to public records about her newly created Education Task Force charged with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. McGeachin’s office responded to some of the requests well past the time limits set by state law and denied many of the records under a variety of exemptions, some so irrelevant – including one specific to fishing and hunting licenses – that it appeared she “may have blindly selected them at random,” the judge wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials on Friday accused DoorDash and Grubhub of harming restaurants and their customers by charging high fees and through other deceptive practices when delivery and takeout business became essential to the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. The officials believe their lawsuits against the delivery companies are the most sweeping of their kind brought by a city. “It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times, using unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. Representatives for the two companies called the lawsuits filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court “baseless.” Delivery companies have been the target of legal authorities in other cities and states before, but those efforts have targeted specific policies, compared to Chicago’s attack on numerous elements of the companies’ operations. According to the lawsuits, both companies advertise delivery services for restaurants without their agreement, hurting the businesses’ reputation when customers are unhappy about the cost or service. City investigators also found that they charge higher prices than restaurants set on their own menus and charge more fees than initially disclosed.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A statue of a top Indiana suffragist has been erected outside the library where she trained and organized other activists for women’s right to vote. The bronze likeness of Marie Stuart Edwards was unveiled Thursday at the Peru Public Library, where Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch and Edwards’ two grandsons spoke about her dedication to the cause. The statue depicts a young Edwards standing by her bicycle and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, gazing into the distance with a look of determination, the Kokomo Tribune reports. Crouch said women like Edwards made it possible for her to become the state’s second in command. “We here in this crowd are able to participate in the democratic process, all of us, because of Marie Stewart Edwards,” she said. “We have her, and all that she did and all that she stood for, to thank for our ability to stand here as equals.” In February 1920, Edwards helped found the nationwide League of Women Voters. Within a year, about 2 million women had joined the nonpartisan organization that pushed to educate women about their new rights as voters. Congress passed the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote in August 1920. Work on the $105,000 statue and pocket park surrounding it began after Rediscover Downtown Peru was awarded a $35,000 grant last year to help pay for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s chief justice on Friday signed an order making masks mandatory in areas controlled by the courts, a contrast to a state law that bans similar mandates in public schools where children have resumed classes amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases. The order signed by Chief Justice Susan Christensen said all people entering court-controlled areas must wear a face covering regardless of vaccination status. “This requirement applies statewide and does not depend on a particular county’s or area’s positivity rate or transmission status,” Christensen wrote. She said the Iowa Supreme Court reviewed recent revisions to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding mask-wearing in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. The order contradicts Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ long-term policy against mask mandates. In May, she signed a law that bans cities, counties and school districts from requiring masks. Reynolds has been put on notice by U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, who said in a letter last week that the Iowa law is “against science-based strategies for preventing the spread of COVID-19.” Reynolds lashed out at President Joe Biden after receiving the letter and suggested the CDC has no scientific proof masks stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state agency is pushing to process hundreds of applications for coronavirus relief funds from renters facing eviction and their landlords after spending weeks this spring hiring and training more than 100 new employees to do the work. The state’s Housing Resources Corporation is handling the bulk of the emergency rental assistance in Kansas, and most of its money hasn’t yet been distributed. Questions about how quickly tenants’ overdue rent and utility bills are being paid off became even more compelling late Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a federal moratorum on evictions. States, cities and counties have until 2025 to spend some of the dollars, but the federal government hoped for 65% of the first tranche of aid – $15.7 billion total – to go out before Oct. 1. Although the state’s largest city, Wichita, has hit that target with its own program, the Kansas housing agency, like such agencies in most states and most cities and counties with their own programs, was far short at the end of July, the U.S. Treasury Department reported last week. “It’s just not getting the money to people fast enough,” said Dustin Hare, an organizer for the tenant advocacy group Rent Zero Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and several other elected Republicans joined a “freedom rally” Saturday, where they disparaged COVID-19 restrictions and Gov. Andy Beshear in front of a supportive crowd. Massie, Kentucky Auditor Mike Harmon, and state Reps. Josh Calloway, Savannah Maddox and Felicia Rabourn gathered on the steps of the State Capitol and took turns giving speeches to a crowd of at least 300 people. The rally came at the end of a week when Kentucky repeatedly broke grim records for the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19. “COVID is a serious disease,” Massie said during his speech, noting he has known people who died from it. “But there’s another disease, another virus, in the state of Kentucky. ... It’s called the Beshear virus.” The congressman joked he thought former Gov. Matt Bevin had gotten rid of the “Beshear virus” when he succeeded former Gov. Steve Beshear as the state’s top official. But then the commonwealth ended up catching the “Andy variant,” he said, referring to Andy Beshear, the son of Steve Beshear who followed in his father’s footsteps. Symptoms of the “Andy variant” include “loss of balance in your bank account” and confusion, Massie joked. At one point he derisively referred to masks as “face diapers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A man is celebrating his 80th birthday by cycling 80 miles a day for 10 days straight. His personal challenge began last Tuesday and will continue through this Thursday. Phil Baker’s actual birthday is Aug. 28. He travels a route that largely uses River Road, with some variations, to take him 40 miles from home and then 40 miles back. He leaves his house at 5:15 a.m. and gets back about 10:30 a.m. A fellow cyclist is riding with him each day. Baker, a lifelong athlete who’s competed in Ironman triathlons, began training for his birthday-week rides about a year ago. He had been walking and hiking up to 20 miles a day, to take a break from cycling, then picked up the bike again, starting his training by traveling 10 miles in an hour, then slowly increasing his speed over longer periods of time. “I got up from 10 miles to 20, 25 miles, then 30 and 35 miles, and up to 40 and 50 miles for a longer length of riding,” Baker said. “It wasn’t all done in an hour, but the hour goal was a way to start.” Baker said he also bought a “brand new, beautiful bike” – a Canyon bike he admires that’s used by one of the teams in the Tour de France. A local bike shop helped Baker adjust the bike seat and handle bars to fit him, he said. “It’s all about where you are on the bike,” Baker said. “Fit is everything.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s annual bear hunt gets started for the season Monday as hunters prepare for another year of pandemic-era fall hunting. The Maine bear hunt runs from Monday to Nov. 27, though most of the season takes place between now and Sept. 25. That’s the period of the season in which it’s legal to hunt bears using bait. The season kicked off Saturday with Youth Bear Day, which is reserved for young hunters. The state’s other big fall hunting seasons for deer, moose and wild turkey will begin later in the fall. Maine officials have encouraged more hunting during the pandemic because it’s an outdoor activity that easily lends itself to social distancing.\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport: A select group of inmates is being trained by national experts to restore weathered and disturbed gravestones at a historic cemetery. Officials announced the initiative Friday in Williamsport, saying it would provide the inmates an opportunity to learn stone masonry skills that pay between $20 to $35 an hour in Maryland. The work will take place at Riverview Cemetery, where more than a dozen headstones were damaged last month in a case still under investigation. The plan outlined Friday also calls for inmates to clean all the gravestones and reset them, as many have become destabilized over the years. Craig Rickets, 54, was one of the inmates from the Maryland Correctional Training Center south of Hagerstown who has been involved. Of all the jobs he’s done through prison training programs – including landscaping, shipping and handling, and janitorial work – Rickets said restoring gravestones was the most “productive.” “It makes me feel like I have new life,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit challenging a requirement that students at the University of Massachusetts campuses in Boston and Lowell be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to return to campus. Students at the schools sued in July, asking the judge to find the vaccination mandates to be unconstitutional. The UMass Boston student also alleged she was improperly denied a religious exemption. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said the schools have a strong interest in reducing the spread of the disease. And she found that despite the students’ assertion that the policy is “arbitrary or not based in science,” the schools “based the decision upon both medical and scientific evidence and research and guidance and thus is at least rationally related to these legitimate interests.” The judge also noted that students who refuse to get vaccinated may still take online classes or defer their enrollment a semester. But even if the policy meant they would be deprived of a UMass education, their argument still fails, she said. “Moreover, the balance of equities tips in Defendants’ favor given the strong public interest here that they are promoting – preventing further spread of COVID-19 on campus, a virus which has infected and taken the lives of thousands of Massachusetts residents,” she wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nEagle Harbor: A group of Michigan Tech University alumni have submitted the winning bid for a former U.S. Air Force radar station in the Upper Peninsula that they hope can become a tourist destination. The bid was $227,000, The Daily Mining Gazette reports, citing a statement from Keweenaw County, which controls the property. The former base, which has more than 100 acres in Eagle Harbor Township, is known locally as Mount Horace Greeley. For nearly 40 years, it served as a radar station during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The winning bidder was identified as Zach Garner of Perry, who said he submitted an offer on behalf of himself and Michigan Tech alumni who are engineers. The school is 30 miles away in Houghton. “We are passionate about the Keweenaw Peninsula and respectful of the deep history rooted in the area, including this site itself,” said a letter that accompanied the bid. The goal is to address any environmental issues at the former base, employ local residents and turn the land into a tourism spot, the letter said. The group said it has “dreamt for years about the prospect of turning the aforementioned property into a destination that anyone and everyone can enjoy.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nClimax: Some consider it a geological wonder. A crack in the soil of a bean field in northwestern Minnesota has caused the ground to collapse 25 feet, creating a quarter-mile-long ravine. Wayne and Erllene Erickson are the fourth generation on the family farm near Climax in Polk County and say they’ve never seen anything like it, WDAY-TV reports. “(It’s) kind of scary. It is sad, sad to see it,” said Erllene Erickson as she surveyed the fallen bean field. “Mother Nature does what she wants.” The fallen land is pushing under the river bank, sending more dirt into the Red River. Wayne Erickson is trying to make sense of what happened on his farm. “When I drove out here, it looked like the Grand Canyon. We didn’t have all that slumping going on; it was just straight down. Straight up and down,” Erickson said. Geologists with the University of North Dakota say the dry weather, a drop in water levels on the Red River and recent rains can form a perfect storm for something like this to occur. Crevasses are still forming as the land continues shifting. Soil experts were expected to visit the field to study the natural phenomenon.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The board governing the state’s public universities voted Friday not to require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 despite the objections of the two medical doctors who are part of the board. During a special meeting, nine members of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees said the vaccine should not be mandated. Many said they support students getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but shots should be voluntary. Dr. Alfred McNair Jr. and Dr. Steven Cunningham were the only two board members who voted to mandate inoculations. “This volunteer thing is ridiculous,” said McNair, who is chief of medical staff at Biloxi Regional Medical Center. “If they had polio, it wouldn’t be a volunteer thing.” Mississippi’s public universities already mandate that students be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, according to Institutions of Higher Learning bylaws. Students studying in a health-related field must be vaccinated against hepatitis B. McNair said cases among young people are rising in the state, and he’s seeing children hospitalized with more severe symptoms than ever before. He said people who recover from the coronavirus can have long-term side effects.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Intensive care units are nearly full across the area, creating challenges for hospitals battling to keep up with the high number of COVID-19 patients. The Kansas City Star reports 215 ICU beds in the region were in use last week – the most since the onset of the pandemic – and that number has grown almost every day since. As of Wednesday, 224 people were hospitalized in ICUs, according to hospital data tracked by the Mid-America Regional Council, a regional planning agency. The data includes hospitals in Jackson and Clay counties in Missouri and Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas. Kansas City isn’t unique in Missouri. Data posted Friday on the state’s COVID-19 dashboard showed 690 ICU patients across the state among 2,395 people hospitalized with COVID-19. On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson rescinded the COVID-19 related state of emergency that was put in place March 13, 2020, and replaced it with a narrower state of emergency that focuses on the health care system. Parson, a Republican, said in a statement that the changes acknowledge the progress the state has made when it comes to the pandemic, particularly now that vaccines are available. But he continued regulatory and other procedures that will allow the still-struggling health care system to respond to increased caseloads.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Several parents are suing Missoula public schools over a mask requirement as the school year is set to begin amid a new wave of COVID-19 cases. An attorney representing parents of students in Missoula said the requirement is in violation of the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades said Thursday that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override that individual right. Kevin Twidwell, an attorney at the Kaleva law office representing the schools, said they disagree with the allegation that face coverings violate the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. An online fundraiser organized to cover the costs of filing the lawsuit raised $10,000 as of Thursday. Matt Stivers, who donated $100, wrote that his son has difficulty breathing while wearing a mask because of a heart defect. “Kids need to see each others’ faces and deserve a normal experience in school. They are being deprived of non-verbal communication with other students,” Stivers wrote on the fundraiser page. The Missoula County Public Schools Board of Trustees voted earlier this month to approve the mask mandate for the first six weeks of school.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The Nebraska State Fair has kicked off and will offer a full slate of attractions and music a year after the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the annual event’s concerts, carnival and other draws. Besides the rides, gooey fried food and livestock shows, this year’s fair in Grand Island will feature a bevy of concerts, including Modern West featuring Kevin Costner on Thursday, BandaLos Sebastianes on Friday and Jon Pardi on Saturday. Warrant and Skid Row, both wildly popular “hair bands” in the 1980s, will perform Tuesday in the Events Center. The theme of this year’s state fair is “Nothing More Nebraskan,” and the event will run through Sept. 6. Executive Director Bill Ogg said this year’s fair has more 4-H entries and FFA exhibitors than it had in 2019. “So there’s a rebound effect,” Ogg told the Grand Island Independent. “We should have one of the strongest participation years in 4-H and FFA.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An equestrian supply store has sold out of a drug primarily used to deworm horses that vaccine skeptics are peddling as a remedy to the coronavirus. V & V Tack and Feed no longer has any of the drug, ivermectin, KTNV-Las Vegas reports. The store in the northwestern Las Vegas metropolitan area fields multiple calls daily about whether it has the drug in stock and now requires customers to show proof that they own horses to buy it. Store associate Shelley Smith told the TV station that people coming into the store have told her they were taking the drug for coronavirus and experiencing side effects including loss of vision. “You should not be taking this product. This is not for humans to take. This is to treat parasites in horses,” Smith said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a health advisory Thursday urging people against taking ivermectin, saying that poison control centers had experienced a five-fold increase in calls for symptoms ranging from hallucinations and confusion to gastrointestinal issues. The Southern Nevada Health District warned people Wednesday that, although the drug could be used to treat conditions like head lice and worms in humans, taking doses manufactured for horses could result in hospitalization or death.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Lottery generated a record $518.5 million in total sales in the fiscal year ending June 30, officials said. It surpassed its previous record from the last fiscal year of $392.2 million. “With an expanded menu of games, new offerings like KENO 603, sports betting through our collaboration with DraftKings, NH iLottery, and a consistent focus on engaging our current audience and tapping into new markets, we feel confident we have positioned the New Hampshire Lottery for continued success and growth as we look toward the future,” Charlie McIntyre, the lottery’s executive director, said in a statement. The New Hampshire Lottery and DraftKings launched mobile sports betting in the state in December 2019, and retail locations followed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former government official who says she is a sexual assault survivor is demanding that the Republican gubernatorial candidate stop using her story as a “political prop” in a campaign video that bashes Gov. Phil Murphy. Katie Brennan, who has said she was sexually assaulted by a peer while they both worked on Murphy’s behalf in 2017, said Friday that she wasn’t consulted before Jack Ciattarelli launched PhilMurphyDoesNotCare.com. The site prominently features a video of Brennan publicly testifying before legislators and charges that Murphy uses women as “political props.” She said in a tweet earlier she wasn’t a prop or a pawn herself. “Take it down,” she said Friday. “I wasn’t consulted prior to the creation of the website and the ad campaign, and had I been, would have expressed my displeasure with it. It looks like an endorsement of the Ciattarelli campaign, which is not my intent,” she said in a phone interview. “There is a way to hold people accountable and talk about the mistakes of the past and what their vision and plans for betterment and equity and reform are in the future without dragging me into the fight in a way that I certainly did not ask to be.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state is flush with cash due to a quick recovery of oil and gas markets and higher-than-expected gross receipts tax revenues as consumers spend federal pandemic relief checks and tap into other recovery aid, state finance officials and legislative analysts said. The officials briefed a key panel of state lawmakers Friday and said while revenues are expected to hit record levels for the next fiscal year, the pandemic remains a risk factor that still has the potential to derail economic recovery if cases continue to surge or shutdowns are imposed again. While widespread shutdowns are not likely, the forecast shows what analysts described as a significant upward revision in recurring revenues for the current fiscal year – up more than $632 million from estimates made just six months ago. Nearly $1.4 billion in new money is expected for the 2023 fiscal year, marking growth of nearly 19%. That means lawmakers will have more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs. It also means more money is expected to be funneled into the state’s permanent endowments. Some lawmakers warned that the federal recovery aid won’t be around forever and urged others on the Legislative Finance Committee to keep building the state’s reserves.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Cutting-edge DNA technology will be used to analyze the remains of more than 1,100 victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center that have yet to be identified. Newsday reported Saturday that the New York City medical examiner’s office has been approved to use the forensic method known as Next Generation Sequencing, which is already being used by the Department of Defense to identify remains from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. Thousands of human remains from Sept. 11 have yet to be identified because they’re too damaged and degraded to be analyzed by conventional methods. They’re currently being stored at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. The medical examiner’s office could begin using the process before the end of the year, Mark Desire, chief of the office’s missing persons and body identification unit, told the newspaper. While the remains of about 1,600 of the 2,754 World Trace Center victims have been identified, the process has slowed over the years, and the last identification was made in 2019. The medical examiner’s office began studying Next Generation Sequencing in 2018, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the approval process until this year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A panel of state trial judges refused Friday to halt its order restoring voting rights for tens of thousands of residents convicted of felonies whose current punishments don’t include prison time. The three judges denied the delay sought by attorneys for top Republican lawmakers on the same day the panel’s majority filed an explanation about why they authorized voting access for potentially 56,000 offenders in North Carolina otherwise unable to cast ballots. One of the judges announced that decision earlier last week, in advance of a written order. GOP lawmakers wanted the temporary delay while they appeal the ruling. A trial concluded last week in a lawsuit filed in 2019 by several civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. The two Superior Court judges who agreed to issue Friday’s preliminary injunction wrote that the harm the offenders alleged they would experience by having to wait another election without voting was “both substantial and irreparable.” Friday’s order said election officials can’t deny voter registration to any convicted felon who is on probation, parole or post-release supervision.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Human cases of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus are on the rise in the state, with the severity of symptoms resulting in some hospitalizations, according to health officials. So far, five people have confirmed cases, with four in the hospital, as well as two of six people with pending cases. The confirmed cases are in Cass, Mercer, Sargeant and Stutsman counties, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, body aches or rash. People with severe cases may experience a stiff neck, altered mental status, paralysis, coma and possibly death, health officials said. Most people infected with West Nile experience no symptoms. The number of West Nile cases in North Dakota varies year by year, with seven confirmed human cases last year and nine in 2019. But in 2018 there were 204. “Peak WNV activity historically has occurred in August,” state Department of Health epidemiologist Amanda Bakken said. “This is the time to be vigilant and take precautions, not just when people are aware mosquitoes are biting them.” Three of the five confirmed cases in people this year have affected the nervous system. “Because our cases have had particularly severe symptoms … it is especially important that people protect themselves,” Bakken said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s correctional agency terminated seven employees Friday after officials say prison guards used excessive and unjustified force against a Black inmate before he died in custody in February. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction sent a notice of removal to five corrections officers, a supervisor and a licensed nurse following an investigation into the in-custody death of 55-year-old Michael McDaniel. Security footage released by the agency in July showed McDaniel collapsing on his own and being taken down to the floor by prison guards at least 16 times before he died at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, a Columbus suburb, on Feb. 6. “We’re responsible for what happened in that video,” director Annette Chambers-Smith told reporters in July, after releasing surveillance footage of the incident. “There is no question about that.” One of the officers involved, Heath Causey, is accused in the records released Friday of performing a “take-down” of McDaniel while the inmate was being escorted outside without shoes and a coat and while wearing a ripped T-shirt, “causing his body to veer off the walking path and land face-down in a snow-covered area.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city must pay nearly $1 million to five attorneys who successfully challenged an anti-panhandling ordinance adopted by the city, a federal judge ruled last week. U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton issued the order approving 2,474 billable hours that attorneys spent on the case for a total of $986,350. A federal appeals court determined in 2020 that the ordinance placing restrictions on panhandling on street medians is an unconstitutional violation of free speech. Plaintiffs included two homeless men who used the medians to panhandle, including one who sold issues of the Curbside Chronicle newspaper, two joggers, a journalist, and a community activist who has used medians to protest and erect signs for his legislative candidacy. Several attorneys for the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union were among those who represented the plaintiffs. “We hope this fee amount will deter Oklahoma City from violating the constitutional rights of Oklahomans and encourage them to consider the concerns of the community in the future,” Megan Lambert, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Oklahoma, said in a statement. “We will continue our fight for the free speech rights of all Oklahomans.”\n\nOregon\n\nSpringfield: A COVID-19 outbreak at an assisted living facility that has infected 64 people and killed five began with an unvaccinated worker, public health officials said. The outbreak at Gateway Living in Springfield began July 5. The facility has 105 employees and 101 residents; only 63% of the staff and 82% of the residents are completely vaccinated. Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis said the outbreak began with an unvaccinated employee who worked while infectious. The outbreak arrived as an immense surge of coronavirus cases hit Oregon, driven by the especially contagious delta variant as well as vaccine obstinacy in some quarters. COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased 990% in Oregon since July 9, according to health officials. Many hospitals have canceled elective surgeries, and some patients are housed in hallways instead of rooms. More than 90% of the state’s intensive care and hospital beds are full, and health officials say the overwhelming majority of people hospitalized are unvaccinated. The state is deploying crisis teams of hundreds of nurses, respiratory therapists, paramedics and nursing assistants to the hardest hit regions. Officials in Tillamook County said Friday they no longer have capacity to store the bodies of the dead and are asking for refrigerated morgue trucks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A juvenile detention center in western Pennsylvania will close next month after state officials revoked its license. Allegheny County Manager William McKain says the Shuman Juvenile Detention Center in Pittsburgh will close Sept. 18. Youths being housed there will likely be transferred to other facilities the state operates, but specific plans have not yet been disclosed. The state’s human services department notified the county Friday that the license for the 46-year-old facility was being revoked. Officials cited the center’s “continued failure to follow regulations and failure to improve on past violations.” The Shuman Center’s fourth provisional license was issued July 1 and was set to expire Jan. 1, 2022. Provisional licenses are issued to facilities where violations are found so that the sites have time to address the problems, officials said. Shuman has been operating under a provisional license since December 2015. The latest violations, stemming from an investigation between June 16 and July 1, included a heroin overdose and the theft of $140 from a nurse’s purse when a child was left unattended. Twenty children and young adults were being held at the facility as of last Monday. They range in age from 14 to 20.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has made it easier for retired nurses and other health care workers to reenter the workforce without affecting their pension. Gov. Dan McKee signed the executive order Thursday to make sure there are enough health care professionals during the pandemic. Many hospitals have experienced staffing shortages, and there are concerns about another resurgence of coronavirus cases caused by the delta variant. If a retiree is determined by the state Department of Health to have the skills necessary to address the pandemic, the agency can provide a written certification that their reemployment is of finite duration and is necessitated by the good faith belief that their skills are needed, the order says. McKee previously said that workers at state-licensed health care facility are required to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 1. There have been protests against the requirement. The state is also preparing a field hospital Cranston for possible reopening if it is needed to help handle a surge in new cases. The site originally opened in December and was taken out of service in March but kept stocked with medical equipment and other supplies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The daily numbers of new COVID-19 cases are reaching levels only seen in the worst days of the pandemic before vaccines were widely available, leading hospitals to warn that unless the spike in cases is curbed soon, there will be dire consequences. There were 6,697 new cases of the disease reported Friday in South Carolina, the Department of Health and Environmental Control reported. The only days with more cases reported since the pandemic started 18 months ago were 7,680 cases on Jan. 6 and 7,450 on Jan. 8. “The expected surge in new cases once children returned to school across South Carolina and the proliferation of the highly transmissible delta variant has fueled a spike that requires our attention and legislative consideration of the removal of masking restrictions,” the health agency wrote in a statement. The Republican-dominated General Assembly in June passed an item in the state budget threating to take state money away from school districts that require masks. Back then, South Carolina was averaging 150 new COVID-19 cases a day. Now that average is above 4,500 new cases. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is one of the biggest defenders of the mask ban and hasn’t directly addressed the pandemic since Aug. 9.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Four universities are partnering on a new center to disrupt criminal networks. The schools will use a $4 million state grant to create the Center for Understanding and Disrupting the Illicit Economy. South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota State University in Brookings, Dakota State University in Madison, and the University of South Dakota in Vermillion are involved in the project. Dr. Jon Kellar, a professor at South Dakota Mines, will lead a team focused on identifying counterfeit goods, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Kellar said it’s a widespread problem that can have big implications. “Let’s say you buy a counterfeit purse – you think, well, I got a good deal, and it looks good. And, well, you probably think it’s a victimless crime,” he said. “Well, in fact, those products are being used by terrorists to generate cash to fund their networks.” Kellar said it’s important to be a conscientious consumer. “The first rule of thumb is if it seems too good to be true, it probably is,” he said. “You’ll notice some of the packaging may not look right; there may be misspellings. Or instead of a regular branded box, it comes in a white bag with some cheese cloth.” Researchers will also focus on tracking fake pharmaceuticals and exploring the dark web and other networks used by criminals.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State House Speaker Cameron Sexton has announced the members selected to serve on the House’s redistricting committee. According to a news release, Sexton’s office on Thursday said the committee will include eight Republicans and four Democrats. Deputy Speaker Curtis Johnson, R-Clarksville, will chair the committee, and Speaker Pro Tempore Pat Marsh, R-Shelbyville, will be the committee’s vice chair. “The makeup of this panel is representative of the distinctive voices of Tennesseans from across all three grand divisions of our state,” Sexton, R-Crossville, said in a statement. Lawmakers will use newly released U.S. Census Bureau data to redraw state and congressional districts currently dominated by Republicans. The proposals will be taken up in the 2022 legislative session that begins in January. Republican Gov. Bill Lee has veto power over the finalized plan, but he’s not expected to put up many objections.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The University of Texas is providing cash and other prizes to encourage UT community members to get COVID-19 shots. UT students, staff and faculty who have received at least one vaccine dose at any location can upload their vaccine card on UT’s portal to be eligible to enter into the university’s weekly prize drawing. The drawings will occur from Sept. 3 to Oct. 8, and the prizes will vary each week, according to UT’s Protect Texas website. Prizes for students include up to $10,000 in cash, gift cards, parking permits, wireless headphones, tickets to a home football game with UT President Jay Hartzell, and various other prizes. Faculty and staff members can win cash prizes up to $500, coolers, tumblers and the opportunity to take a tour of the new Moody Center with UT athletic director Chris Del Conte. UT is encouraging but not requiring community members to get vaccinated and wear masks. Gov. Greg Abbott has prohibited agencies that receive public funding in Texas from instituting vaccine and mask requirements. UT spokeswoman Eliska Padilla said the incentive program, which was announced Thursday and is funded by gifts from a variety of donors, aims to increase the vaccination rates of 18- to 24-year-olds. She said UT has no plans to incentivize vaccinations after Oct. 8.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Hospitals operated by Intermountain Healthcare have hit 100% capacity at their intensive care units because of increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19, and doctors and nurses are growing increasingly frustrated. During a live update Friday, Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious disease physician, said health care workers are seeing two growing trends: children with COVID-19 and severe infection in those seeming to be young and healthy. “Children’s Hospitals are seeing more COVID cases this round and more children coming in because of it,” Webb said. Statewide, 16 children have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past week, according to the Utah Department of Health, with 1,132 children ages 5 to 13 having tested positive. There were 467 people hospitalized overall as of Friday, including 184 who were in intensive care units. One reason that more children are contracting COVID could be the high amounts of exposure in classrooms and social gatherings, Webb said. However, the different coronavirus variants have also played a role in higher infection rates across the board, not just in children. “Delta is simply a different disease in some ways than the other variants,” Webb said.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: Farmers and their crews from around the state are ready to battle in the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont’s sixth annual Farmer Olympics. The event will be held Tuesday at Honeyfield Farm in Norwich. Teams will compete in skills ranging from physical to cerebral to ridiculous, organizers said. Among the past events were the zucchini relay, squash shot put and blindfolded seeding. Awards will go to the best-performing teams. “The Farmer Olympics are all about joy, celebration and connection, and this year, after the challenges farmers faced over the last 18 months, this event is really needed,” said Zea Luce, NOFA-VT’s events and engagement coordinator. Farms can register teams through NOFA-VT.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: Liberty University announced a temporary campuswide quarantine Thursday amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. The quarantine is set to begin Monday and last until Sept. 10, news outlets report. The university has about 15,000 students and 5,000 faculty or staff on campus. There were 159 known, active cases among students, faculty and staff as of Wednesday, according to the university’s online COVID-19 dashboard. Of those cases, 124 cases were among students. It was a sharp increase from the prior week, when 40 students and staff tested positive for the coronavirus as students were welcomed back to campus. It also surpasses the highest confirmed active caseload last September, when at least 141 people on campus tested positive, and nearly 1,200 people were quarantined. As the university began its fall semester last week, the university, which doesn’t require vaccination, lifted building capacity restrictions and distancing and masking requirements. The university changed its protocol late Thursday to enact the campuswide quarantine, moving classes online and suspending large indoor gatherings. Outdoor events will continue as scheduled, and worship services will move to the stadium.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state judge struck a measure on homelessness from the November ballot even as the city remains mired in a long-term humanitarian crisis. The so-called Compassion Seattle proposal would direct the city to provide 2,000 units of emergency or permanent housing within a year and require the city to ensure parks, playgrounds and sidewalks remain clear of encampments. King County Superior Court Judge Catherine Shaffer said Friday that it would conflict with state law and usurp the City Council’s power. Shaffer said she and other voters might like what the measure’s proponents are trying to do, but it exceeds what can be accomplished through a local charter amendment. “You can’t amend a city charter to conflict with state law,” Shaffer said. “I like this charter amendment as a voter. But as a judge, it cannot stand.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness and the Transit Riders Union sued to block the measure, officially known as Charter Amendment 29. They argued that it is beyond the scope of local initiative power and violates state law on how local governments can address homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLogan: Guided tours of elk have returned to southern West Virginia. The West Virginia State Parks system announced that viewing tours will be held on weekends starting Sept. 11 and ending Oct. 24. They will start and finish at the Chief Logan State Park lodge in Logan County, the parks system said in a news release. There also will be a few midweek evening tours. Morning tours start at 5:30 a.m.. and evening tours start at 4 p.m. Each tour is limited to 12 people. The tours typically will last four hours, depending on weather and viewing conditions. Groups typically walk or hike up to 3 miles. Tickets cost $30 and can be purchased online. Elk have been transplanted over the past five years at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area in Logan County. They were brought from the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in western Kentucky and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A suburban school district is meeting to possibly reconsider opting out of a federally funded free meal program, a move that met with widespread criticism from parents after school board members said they were concerned participating students would “become spoiled.” The Waukesha school board planned a special meeting Monday to discuss its participation in the program, after parents and other advocates put pressure on the board to reconsider. The Alliance for Education in Waukesha held a rally outside the district office Friday to call for reinstating the program. Administrators opted into the supplemental program last year during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the school board has decided to end it. “As we get back to whatever you want to believe normal means, we have decisions to make,” Joseph Como, president of the school board, said in a meeting. “I would say this is part of normalization.” Board member Karin Rajnicek said the free program made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Waukesha students from low-income families will still be able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A judge is offering defendants a break in their court fines if they agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Natrona County Circuit Court Judge Steven Brown began offering the deal earlier this summer after seeing vaccination rates stagnate. Less than 40% of eligible people in Wyoming are fully vaccinated, putting it among the bottom five states in vaccination rate. The city of Casper has a community service program that works with courts to offer a $10 reduction in fines per hour of work for local charities, nonprofits and other organizations. Getting vaccinated is “just another form of community service,” Brown said Thursday. One woman making an initial appearance in Circuit Court on Monday was offered a $200 reduction in her $560 fine if she was fully vaccinated within 30 days. The fine would be reduced when she returned with proof of receiving the shot. Brown said he doesn’t require vaccination, just incentivizes it, noting other states hold cash drawings, some with million-dollar prizes. The court doesn’t track how many people have accepted the deal. The two other judges in the circuit have not been offering fine reductions for vaccinations.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/06/bounty-bags-parrot-false-alarm-virtual-hike-news-around-states/40948393/", "title": "Bounty of bags, parrot false alarm: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Litter crews gathered more than 113 tons of roadside litter in the Tuscaloosa area alone in 2019, officials say. If the litter were measured in plastic bottles, it would stretch from Tuscaloosa to Dallas “with a few miles to spare,” says John McWilliams, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Transportation’s West Central Region. The state’s costs to clean up roadside litter have reached $200,000 in Tuscaloosa County and $6.8 million statewide. State officials have highlighted problems with roadside litter in the past and launched a statewide litter awareness campaign in 2018, naming it “Trash Costs Cash.” It included public service messages on social media sites, television and radio.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A rural state senator has called on Gov. Mike Dunleavy to seek a delay in the implementation of Real ID driver’s licenses. Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, on Thursday said Dunleavy should use his influence with President Donald Trump to delay the Real ID requirement, scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to increase driver’s license security standards. Starting Oct. 1, Alaskans must have a Real ID or another form of federal identification, such as a passport, to pass through security at airports and other federally secured areas. Alaskans without the REAL ID driver’s license could be barred from travel. Olson noted in a press release that the state Department of Administration is seeking $60,000 in donations from Alaskans for an outreach program that could help those without Division of Motor Vehicle offices in their communities obtain REAL ID driver’s licenses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state is facing a critical shortage of blood after donations fell during the holidays, the state’s primary blood supplier said Friday as it issued an urgent call for donors. Arizona has less than a day’s supply of the universal blood type, O-negative, and less than a two-day supply of O-positive, which can be used on anyone with a positive blood type, according to Vitalant, the organization formerly known as United Blood Services. The group provides blood for 62 Arizona hospitals. There are shortages of other blood types as well. Blood supplies always fall during the holidays, the slowest period for donations, but this year’s shortage is more severe than typical, says Sue Thew, a spokeswoman for Vitalant. “It’s bad enough to think about people being in the hospital this time of year,” Thew says. “They shouldn’t have to worry about having an ample blood supply.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s finance office says higher-than-expected sales and corporate income tax collections in December helped keep the state’s revenue above forecast for the current fiscal year. The Department of Finance and Administration reports the state’s net available general revenue in December totaled $547.6 million, which was $6 million above December 2018 and $5.6 million above forecast. The state’s net available revenue so far for the fiscal year that began July 1 totals $2.9 billion, $93.1 million above forecast. Arkansas’ sales tax collections in December totaled $225 million, which was $9.4 million above the same month the previous year and $1.3 million above forecast. The state’s corporate income tax collections totaled $74.1 million, $13.5 million lower than the same month the previous year but $7 million above forecast.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A skeleton found by hikers this fall near the state’s second-highest peak, Mount Williamson, was identified Friday as a Japanese American artist who had left the Manzanar internment camp to paint in the mountains in the waning days of World War II. The Inyo County sheriff used DNA to identify the remains of Giichi Matsumura, who succumbed to the elements during a freak summer snowstorm while on a hiking trip with other members of the camp. Matsumura had apparently stopped to paint a watercolor while the other men continued toward a lake to fish. His body wasn’t found for another month, and the tragedy was overshadowed in the immediate days after his Aug. 2, 1945, disappearance when the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb, hastening Japan’s surrender in the war. Matsumura was one of more than 1,800 detainees who died in the 10 prison camps in the West, though it’s one of the more unusual deaths.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: Demonstrators have welcomed the new Bureau of Land Management headquarters in opposition of the acting department director as his appointment was extended. U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed an order Thursday extending the appointment of acting department director William Perry Pendley until April despite criticism, the Daily Sentinel reports. Pendley has drawn criticism for positions he held prior to joining the department including his support of selling public lands, officials said. Dozens of people showed up to the headquarters location in Grand Junction to wave signs and voice their concerns, officials said. The department is responsible for managing public lands, but Pendley is an “anti-public-lands advocate at the helm of an agency that belongs to us,” rally organizer Cody Perry said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorth Haven: A university laboratory began tests Friday on skeletal remains found beneath an 18th-century home in the hopes of identifying the three people believed to be soldiers killed during the Revolutionary War. In December, while homeowners were renovating their house in Ridgefield, the remains were discovered in a grave under the foundation. “These bones are so robust, they’re dense, they’re thick with muscle attachments, (and) they’re long,” says Nick Bellantoni, emeritus state archaeologist of the Connecticut Museum of Natural History. While much remains unknown, researchers believe the remains belonged to men and possibly date to the Battle of Ridgefield in April 1777. The way the men were buried in a haphazard grave also lends credibility to the idea that they were victims of the Battle of Ridgefield. If confirmed, Bellantoni says they would be the first remains from a Revolutionary War soldier recovered in Connecticut.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: At her investiture to the state Supreme Court on Friday, Tamika Montgomery-Reeves’ remarks were full of gratitude. She thanked her family, mentors and colleagues for supporting her. She thanked the governor and lawmaking body for nominating and confirming her to the bench. And she thanked the crowd in the Howard High School auditorium for coming to watch the historic moment. “I do not feel the least bit entitled to be sitting in front of you,” she said. At 38, the former vice chancellor is not only the youngest person to sit on Delaware’s Supreme Court bench but also the first African American Supreme Court justice in the state’s history. Montgomery-Reeves’ choice to hold the event at Howard High was an intentional nod to Delaware’s civil rights history: At the end of the 19th century, the school was one of only two options for black students to receive a secondary education in Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Anti-war protesters gathered outside the White House on Saturday to oppose any war against Iran or Iraq, WUSA-TV reports. Brian Becker, national director of the ANSWER Coalition, said the message from demonstrators was that they want peace, not war. “There’s no reason the United States needs to act as the policeman of the world,” Becker said, joined by what appeared to be several hundred other protesters who blocked streets as they made their way from the White House to the Trump International Hotel. Protesters held signs calling for the removal of troops from Iran and Iraq. Climate activist Jane Fonda was also at the demonstration. She said people should fight climate change and peace simultaneously. “The younger people here should know all the wars that have been fought since you were born were fought over oil,” Fonda said.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Worth Beach: When someone heard chilling cries and the words “Let me out!” they dialed 911. Little did the good neighbor know the cries were that of a 40-year-old parrot named Rambo. After the call, four Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies pulled up and questioned a man who appeared to be repairing a car in his driveway. The Palm Beach Post reports that when the deputies explained their concerns, the man smiled, then told deputies he’d introduce them to the perpetrator. When he returned with the parrot, the deputies burst out laughing. The man told officers that he taught Rambo to scream “Let me out!” when he was a kid and Rambo lived in a cage. PBSO officials could not be reached for more details. The agency did tweet a link to a video Saturday, saying, “Our deputies in Lake Worth Beach came to the help of someone screaming for help. Hilarity ensued.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: City leaders are preparing for another attempt by lawmakers to put the world’s busiest airport under the state’s control. Some prominent politicians say establishing a strong and independent inspector general position could be key to staving off a state takeover of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The inspector general position is seen by some as key to combating City Hall corruption – and helpful in keeping airport operations under local control. The City Council in November solidified its opposition to a state takeover of the airport. They say that’s a top goal when the Georgia General Assembly begins its session later this month. The council has also sponsored legislation to establish the inspector general position.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Authorities will start towing vehicles operated by people on Maui arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Maui County Council passed the DUI tow regulation and Mayor Michael Victorino signed it into law in December, The Maui News reports. Maui Police Department officials expect to implement the new law by the end of the month, authorities said. “We’re trying to change behavior to prevent drunk driving,” said Lt. William Hankins, commander of the police Traffic Section. The law allows police to tow vehicles operated by drivers who are arrested for driving under the influence, driving without a license, or driving after their license is suspended or revoked for impaired driving, authorities said. The registered owner of the vehicle would be responsible for paying the towing and storage fees.\n\nIdaho\n\nBonners Ferry: The tracks have reopened after a train derailment Wednesday stranded locomotives and caused fuel spills in a river in northern Idaho. BNSF Railway spokesman Gus Melonas said the tracks reopened Saturday afternoon after three locomotives and six rail cars derailed in the remote area 10 miles east of Bonners Ferry on the main line. No one was injured. Melonas said crews were still trying to determine how to remove two locomotives still at the scene, including one on the banks and another in the water of the Kootenai River. Melonas said the derailment was caused by a rock slide. The only access to the area is by train or boat, he said. Forty trains use the track daily, including company freights and Amtrak passenger trains traveling between Seattle and Chicago, Melonas said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Efforts to remove invasive plant species at eight area forest preserves appear to be paying off, according to a volunteer restoration project. A project by the Centennial Volunteers has been targeting river-edge sites in Cook County. Group officials say native plants appear to be returning to the locations, which include Clayton Smith Woods near Niles and Miami Woods near Morton Grove, which saw its native plant coverage jump from 56% in 2016 to 68% in 2019. Invasive plants can affect native growth and block sunlight from reaching the ground, which can hurt soil conditions and habitat for wildlife, according to the group. The removed invasive species include buckthorn and honeysuckle. Funding for the project comes from a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The volunteer project was started in 2014 by several organizations including Friends of the Chicago River and the Forest Preserves of Cook County.\n\nIndiana\n\nSeymour: Rocker John Mellencamp has donated $50,000 to his southern Indiana hometown for construction of a plaza near a mural that pays homage to the singer-songwriter and his 1980s hit “Small Town.” Seymour Mayor Craig Luedeman announced Mellencamp’s gift last week at the end of a municipal board meeting before reading a letter from the singer-songwriter, who grew up in the city about 60 miles south of Indianapolis. Mellencamp wrote in the letter that the money is earmarked for creation of a plaza in a parking lot adjacent to the mural, which is painted on the side of This Old Guitar Music Store, the Seymour Tribune reports. The mural celebrating Mellencamp’s career was completed last fall by Indianapolis artist Pamela Bliss and features a 35-foot image of Mellencamp leaning on a guitar, plus a smaller image of him wearing a Seymour FFA jacket.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of car owners ticketed by automated speed cameras are not a public record, a divided Iowa Supreme Court ruled Friday. The court was considering a lawsuit filed by a former Ottumwa police sergeant who was ticketed while driving a city-owned car in May 2016 by the city’s speed camera. Mark Milligan filed an open records request after he was given the ticket as the driver. Typically such citations go to the vehicle’s owner. He wanted to see the names of car owners caught on camera and ticketed and those caught speeding by the automated camera but not given a ticket. Many cities do not enforce the automated fines against public officials driving government vehicles. The city denied his request arguing that the names of people ticketed are confidential under the federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act passed in 1994 and a similar state law designed to protect personal records maintained by state transportation officials.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Gov. Laura Kelly says a troubled unit within a state hospital for the mentally ill is “not a therapeutic environment” and has promised changes. Kelly discussed the latest problems at Osawatomie State Hospital on Thursday after federal inspectors again threatened to pull Medicare funding, The Wichita Eagle reports. Kelly said the facility’s 60-bed Adair Acute Care unit is “way too small to have 60 people with some serious mental health issues in that one place.” She said the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, which oversees state hospitals, is working on improvement plans to lower the number of patients in the unit and provide beds elsewhere. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services has filed a plan to correct the problems, promising to provide more individualized treatment for patients.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Louisville Zoo family has two new members. The new 1-year-old male and female two-toed sloths are “getting acclimated to their new surroundings” and will be available to meet the public starting this spring, according to the zoo’s website. The yet-to-be-named sloths will hang out in the South America zone by the Chilean flamingos, according to the Louisville Zoo. The new exhibit was possible thanks to funding from the Friends of the Louisville Zoo and other donors. The Linneaus’s two-toed sloths hail from South American forest canopy and can be found in Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, and the upper Amazon Basin of Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. The nocturnal, solitary sloths are known for their slow movements and tendency to hang upside down in trees.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A hotel that partially collapsed, killing three people, won’t be totally demolished until the end of the year, city officials said Friday. City officials told local media that the developers who own the building submitted updated demolition plans that significantly changed when the demolition process would get underway. Demolition is now expected to start in May instead of the end of February, pushing back the expected completion date to December. New Orleans Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said the process is going to be more labor intensive than had been previously thought. The fire chief said city officials are not happy with the longer timeline, and the city is urging the company that owns the building to find a way to speed things along. The Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A developer has announced plans to use a former monastery to house newly arrived asylum-seekers. Josh Soley says he’ll offer rentals in a boardinghouse-style project, which includes communal kitchens and bathrooms. He says there will be 40 units available. “Tons of my peers in the real estate industry are building high-end condos,” Soley said. “But there’s not a lot of people who really build on the lower end of the market, and I think there’s tremendous need for that.” Maine is home to thousands of African newcomers, many of them asylum-seekers, and an influx this past summer briefly overwhelmed local shelters. The city has not issued the permits needed for the building, and it is not clear when the units would become available, The Portland Press Herald reports.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Recent comments from the head of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Chesapeake Bay Program about pollution limits designed to improve the health of the bay have sparked concern among environmental groups and some state officials. EPA’s bay program Director Dana Aunkst said at a conference last week in Annapolis that 2025 pollution goals set forth in 2010 for Chesapeake Bay states and the District of Columbia are “an aspiration” and not an enforceable deadline, according to The Capital. Will Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in a statement that position “should put fear in the hearts of all who care about clean water.” He called it a sign that President Donald Trump’s administration is retreating from the bay cleanup effort.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Plans to install a plaque at the Statehouse to mark the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s address to lawmakers in the building in 1965 are moving forward. Masslive.com reports the state House of Representatives on Dec. 23 passed a resolve filed early last year by Democratic state Rep. Bud Williams, of Springfield, that would authorize the installation of a plaque in the House chamber. The address was delivered April 22, 1965, to a joint session of the Legislature during King’s two-day visit to Boston that included a march by thousands from Roxbury to the Boston Common the following day to protest segregation in schools and in other areas of life. After he was refused entrance to the William Boardman School in Roxbury, King said, “I am here to remove segregation from every area of life in Boston.” The measure has been referred to the Committee on Senate Rules.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: For the past few months, visitors at Detroit Metro Airport have had the chance to go through security and send off their loved ones or greet them at the gate. Now, the practice will continue into the new year and possibly beyond, the airport announced. The DTW Destination pass program, in which non-ticketed visitors can access the post-security side of the McNamara and North terminals, was introduced as a pilot phase in October and was scheduled to end Jan. 5. However, officials with the Wayne County Airport Authority have extended the initiative indefinitely, the agency said in a news release. Detroit Metro is one of the few airports in the country to have such a program, as the practice of allowing people to wait at the gate has been discouraged since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWalker: Organizers have canceled the International Eelpout Festival on Leech Lake, saying the economics and other restrictions on the celebration of the state’s ugliest fish no longer work. The organizers said Thursday that they could not reach an agreement on a number of terms with the Cass County officials. So they canceled what would have been the 41st annual event, which had been planned for Feb. 20-23. Past festivals have brought more than 12,000 people to the northern Minnesota town for four days of outdoor winter activities. Cass County Administrator Josh Stevenson said he wasn’t aware of the “impasse” cited by organizers. He wondered whether they might have been glossing over other issues, such as the unpredictability of the weather and the state’s plans to impose limits on how many eelpout anglers can catch.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: A site is being cleared for a new military monument eight months after a tornado destroyed a monument to the fallen soldiers of Neshoba County. Col. Ray Crocker, vice chairman of the Fallen Soldiers Monument Committee, told the Meridian Star that the prep work in Deweese Park included removing the old monument and tree stumps. Organizers are in the process of raising $100,000 for the new monument. “Half of that, which buys all the granite, will have to be raised by the end of February, so we can go ahead and place the order in time to dedicate the monument in May of 2020 on Memorial Day,” Crocker said. He said the monument’s new design will be low to the ground, making it sturdier in bad weather. The height is calculated to make the names visible from a wheelchair and for people who are standing.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Residents living in the city’s poor, segregated neighborhoods are at a greater risk of cancer from air contaminants, and proximity to congested traffic makes up a significant share of that vulnerability, according to a study from Washington University. Christine Ekenga, an assistant professor of public health at the university and the study’s lead author, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the pollutants that conferred the greatest dangers were traffic-related. “The closer a neighborhood was to a major interstate highway, the more elevated their risk was,” she added. “African American neighborhoods were more likely to be in these hotspot areas.” The findings support the university’s other recent research that details how St. Louis is plagued by inequalities. The city’s stark racial divide makes it one of the most segregated in the U.S. and contributes to differing outcomes across a wide range of environmental health concerns.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The Red Cross of Montana seeks more drivers to transport donated blood, plasma and platelets. The organization has set a goal of recruiting 20 more drivers to keep donations moving from donor centers to a testing lab and hospitals. Donated blood has just 33 hours to make it from donor centers to the Red Cross’ only Montana testing lab in Great Falls, the Missoulian reports. “Platelets only stay viable for about five days, so there’s always a huge demand for them, whether it’s treating certain diseases or cancers. Red blood cells give you a little more time with three weeks, but there’s always a real need,” donor and volunteer driver Phil Carlos says. The Red Cross provides training and a vehicle for all potential drivers, who must possess a valid driver’s license, Red Cross spokesman Matt Ochsner says.\n\nNebraska\n\nYork: An anonymous $3 million donation will help York College renovate the oldest surviving original structure on campus, Hulitt Hall. Constructed in 1903, the hall will be transformed into a focal point for visitors and a hub for student services, college officials said. Preliminary renovation plans call for construction of a new entryway and several interior features to make the building comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Hulitt Hall has served as the college’s music conservatory and then as a dormitory until 1972. It’s been used mostly for offices and classrooms since then. It was named for John Hulitt, who donated $5,000 toward the $15,000 cost of construction.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Gov. Steve Sisolak and the state’s entire congressional delegation are trying to persuade the Air Force to make the Nevada Air National Guard Base in Reno the home for a new regional air squadron to respond to emergencies and disasters. Sisolak and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen led a letter to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett on Friday touting the Reno base as the best location for the planned expansion of the Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron. They say the base’s 152nd Airlift Wing is uniquely suited to house the squadron partly because of its proximity to the West Coast and the Airlift Wing’s experience in natural disaster and medical emergency response. Only four such units are currently located west of the continental divide. The officials say placing the 10th unit in Reno would help mitigate the disproportionate allocation of the units in the East.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A program that trains volunteers to promote wildlife conservation and forest stewardship in the state is ready for new participants. The New Hampshire Coverts Project, sponsored by UNH Cooperative Extension and New Hampshire Fish and Game, is accepting applications for its workshop to be held May 13-16. The 25 participants will spend four days learning about ecology, habitat management, land conservation and effective outreach. There is a $50 registration fee, but the program’s sponsors cover lodging, food and other expenses. Participants must commit to spend at least 40 hours in the following year volunteering and motivating others to become wildlife and forest stewards.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSandy Hook: A species is making a comeback along the Jersey coastline. Seabeach amaranth, an Atlantic Coast native once thought extirpated from the state, has rebounded despite long odds, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe says. Seabeach amaranth, a threatened species, is just one of six federally endangered or threatened plants in New Jersey. It’s an annual plant with short bunches of spinach-like leaves trimmed in light red, supported by fleshy red stalks. Biologists from the state and the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey counted 7,195 plants – a 600% increase – during the 2019 survey, conducted on beaches south of Sandy Hook. More than 1,500 of the plants were found at Ocean County’s Island Beach State Park, state officials said. Just 300 were found at the park in 2018.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Animal advocacy groups have filed complaints with federal officials about the treatment of monkeys and other animals at a research facility in New Mexico. The Ohio-based group Stop Animal Exploitation Now outlined its claims against the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in a letter sent Thursday to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The group accuses the lab of a pattern of negligence and carelessness that resulted in the deaths of monkeys. The group is asking for U.S. regulators to investigate the lab and issue penalties for what it claims are violations of federal laws. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent its own letter to the National Institutes of Health on Friday asking that the lab’s public health service animal welfare assurance be withdrawn. Both groups pointed to a November inspection report that outlined inadequate veterinary care and improper animal handling.\n\nNew York\n\nLockport: An upstate school district has begun using facial recognition technology to look for threats, over the objection of civil rights advocates who say it compromises student privacy. The Lockport Central School District said it activated the system Thursday after meeting conditions set by state education officials, including that no students be programmed into the system’s database. Superintendent Michelle Bradley said on the district’s website that the Aegis system is capable of alerting staff to guns as well as individuals who pose a potential threat, including level 2 or 3 sex offenders, suspended staff members, and people flagged by law enforcement or prohibited by court order. The district originally planned to include certain students but backed off amid privacy concerns raised by the New York State Education Department.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Ninety years after its opening, the city’s only historic hotel is in the midst of a more than $2 million facelift. Summit Hospitality Group, which owns the 10-story Dunhill Hotel in uptown, started the renovations last month in a project expected to cost between $2 million and $2.5 million. The changes include replacing the carpets, wallpaper, lighting and much of the furniture in the guest rooms, as well as updating some of the furniture in the meeting rooms. Some of the existing antique furniture will be incorporated into the new design, said Meredith Zingrass, project manager for renovations and development at Summit. The Raleigh-based hotel and restaurant management company expects the revamp to be complete in February. The hotel will stay open during the upgrades.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: An anonymous donor gave Fargo Public Schools more than $28,000 to pay the lunch debt of all students for the first semester of classes. Superintendent Rupak Gandhi told KFGO-AM that no student is denied a hot lunch, but the district must still keep track of expenses because the meals are federally subsidized. “We had an individual step up, and they were going to take care of all outstanding lunch debt that we have from the first half of this year, from the first semester,” Gandhi said. He said the district is working with community organizations to put on fundraisers to cover any future lunch debts. For the rest of this school year, several organizations have already agreed to cover any lunch debt, Gandhi said.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron: An unusual new collection is in the bag at the University of Akron. Roughly 12,000 bags – made of paper, plastic, metal and even glass – and bag-related pieces make up the Lee L. Forman Collection of Bags. The big batch of bags donated to UA includes shopping bags autographed by artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and at least one bag from every presidential election since 1948. There’s a cheeseburger bag signed by Elvis Presley and a 100-year-plus saddle bag made to sit on a horse. Sometimes Forman, who lived in McLean, Virginia, and died in 2009, had a loose definition of bag – the assemblage includes a 45 rpm record sleeve signed by all four Beatles. “Bags are an everyday item that some people don’t think about,” said Jodi Kearns, director of UA’s Institute for Human Science and Culture. “But they are such a significant part of our cultural lives.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nMcAlester: Police are investigating the slaying of a prominent local advocate for transgender rights who was shot and killed on New Year’s Day while driving a cab. Dustin Parker, 25, was found dead early Wednesday in the driver’s seat of the cab he was driving in McAlester, said Preston Rodgers, a police sergeant in the city about 105 miles southeast of Oklahoma City. Police are searching for a suspect or anyone with information about the killing, he said. Rodgers said it was still early in the investigation, and police have not determined whether Parker’s gender identity had anything to do with why he was killed. Brian West, the owner of Rover Taxi and a longtime friend, said Parker had a wife and four children, ages 2 to 13. Parker was well-known in the LGBTQ community and helped found a local chapter of Oklahomans for Equality in McAlester. According to the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, Parker is the first transgender person killed in the U.S. in 2020.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: City officials have not fulfilled a promise to open 140 homeless shelter beds after a public camping ban was enacted more than two weeks ago. The city had not opened any new shelter beds as of Friday after initially promising progress by Jan. 1, KGW-TV reports. There are currently 330 shelter beds available each night, and city churches have the ability to open another 256 beds when the temperature drops to 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below, city officials said. However, opening those additional beds depends on volunteer availability, officials said. City Council has authorized funding support to keep the existing network of shelter available in cold temperatures with the intent to add more beds to the program, but they were unable to meet the additional need, officials said. There are about 1,800 homeless people living in Salem, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man says he carried his mother down 10 flights of stairs to escape an overnight fire at a senior living facility. Officials say one person was treated at the scene after a fire broke out on the fourth floor of Brith Sholom House in the Wynnefield Heights section of the city early Saturday. Shawn Smith tells WPVI-TV that he lives at the facility as his mother’s caregiver. He says they started smelling smoke on their 10th floor hallway following the 1:40 a.m. fire. Smith says he put his mother on his shoulder and carried her all the way down to escape. Fire officials say they had the fire under control in about 20 minutes.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea is hosting a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the state ratifying the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. The Democrat has planned the event for 10 a.m. Monday at the Statehouse Library. In commemoration of women’s suffrage, Gorbea will announce programs and activities to be offered throughout the state this year to increase civic literacy and engagement, including new resources for educators and a new partnership with the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities. “The anniversary of the 19th Amendment is a powerful opportunity to engage Rhode Islanders, especially our youth, in important conversations about the complex history of the women’s suffrage movement and how that history relates to their own civic engagement today,” Gorbea said in a statement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nPickens: A virtual reality project is letting people experience a tough hike at a state park in a matter of minutes and without taking a step. Many people aren’t able to make the strenuous 3.6-mile trek that climbs 2,000 feet to the top of Table Rock Mountain because of mobility or health restrictions, State Park Service Director Paul McCormick told The Post and Courier. The 5-minute virtual reality experience, the first of its kind for the state’s parks, lets them take it in from a chair in the visitor center. They can see the waterfall at Carrick Creek, a shelter marking the halfway point, as well as the views from Governor’s Rock and the top of the mountain. McCormack said the reactions from the roughly 40 people who tried it after it was unveiled Wednesday were “overwhelmingly positive.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The city set a record last year for the value of building permits, according to officials. The Rapid City Journal reports nearly $330 million in projects were approved by the city, the fourth straight year it has topped $300 million. Last year’s figure was bolstered by the permit for a new $111.5 million arena, scheduled to be completed in 2021. The city issued a total of 3,968 permits, the second-highest since 2014. City officials said 30 of the permits generated two-thirds of the overall valuation. Other top permits went for a new Fleet Farm Retail Store at more than $20 million, the Rapid City Economic Development for Ascent Innovation’s new facility at more than $9 million, and Rapid City Regional Hospital renovations at $7.5 million.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: The Tennessee Valley endured its second-highest rainfall total on record in 2019, second only to the rains endured in 2018, according to a federal utility. The Tennessee River Basin averaged almost 15.5 inches above normal last year, including its wettest February recorded, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports, citing the Tennessee Valley Authority. The river basin saw 66.47 inches of rain last year, compared to 67.02 inches in 2018, according to the utility’s River Forecast Center. Another wetter-than-normal weather is forecast for the next three months, a River Forecast Center official said. The Tennessee Valley Authority is the largest public utility in the U.S., spanning 10 million people across Tennessee and parts of six other southeastern states. The utility also uses 49 dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries to avert flood damage.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man who became known as the “affluenza teen” for his unusual defense at a 2013 manslaughter trial was set to be released from jail after prosecutors raised questions Friday about a drug test that triggered an alleged probation violation. Ethan Couch, 22, avoided prison following his initial conviction for killing four people while driving drunk. He was instead sentenced to 10 years of probation after a trial in which a psychologist testified that Couch – 16 at the time of the crash – was affected by “affluenza,” or irresponsibility caused by family wealth. Couch was arrested Thursday after probation officers reported that a drug monitoring patch he wears returned a “weak positive” result for THC, the psychoactive substance found in marijuana, District Attorney Sharen Wilson said in a statement. But it is possible the patch was set off by legal CBD oil, and it will take further testing to be sure, she said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Health officials plan to award pharmacy licenses to 10 companies to dispense medical marijuana at 14 sites across the state, a major development in the program’s approaching launch. The chosen sites announced Friday by the Department of Health are largely in metro Salt Lake City or elsewhere in northern Utah but also include two in southern Utah and one in rural eastern Utah. Along with multiple sites in Salt Lake City, other northern Utah sites include West Bountiful, Ogden, Logan, Park City, Provo, Linden, Springville, and a location that would be Box Elder County, Morgan County or Rich County. The southern sites are Cedar City and St. George, while the sole site in eastern Utah is Vernal. Eight sites may open as early as March, while others would open by July, the department said.\n\nVermont\n\nWest Rutland: The fire department is getting a new Chief Skaza. Joseph Skaza, who has served as the chief of the West Rutland Fire Department for 28 years, announced his retirement. The department’s members unanimously selected First Assistant Chief Michael Skaza to become chief, succeeding his father. Joseph Skaza, who started with the department in 1972, said his father served for 30 years as a firefighter. Joseph Skaza oversaw the modernization of the department’s fleet and the construction of a new fire station. “At the end of a call, coming back to the station and knowing you helped somebody – that gave you a good feeling,” Joseph Skaza told the Rutland Herald. “I would encourage some of the young fellas to get involved. It’s so hard to find volunteers today.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is promising sweeping changes to the state’s criminal justice reforms that include decriminalizing marijuana, softening the penalties for people caught stealing smaller-dollar items, and reducing the number of Virginians whose driver’s licenses are suspended. Northam, a Democrat, said Friday that he wants Virginia to approach criminal justice with compassion, fairness and mercy. “Civilized societies must have laws and punishments for those who break them,” Northam said at OAR Richmond, a center that provides services to adults newly released from jail or prison. “But justice must be fair and equitable, and the punishment should fit the crime.” The package unveiled Friday is part of an ambitious agenda Democrats have promised to pass after winning legislative elections two months ago.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state lawmaker has announced plans to introduce legislation that would cap insulin costs at $100 a month. State Sen. Karen Keiser introduced the bill last month after a report showed patients have spent three times more on insulin increasing from $231 to $736 between 2002 and 2013, KING-TV reports. The measure mandates that health plans issued or renewed on or after Jan. 1, 2021 must cap insulin copayments, deductibles and other forms of cost sharing at $100 for each 30-day supply, officials said. Keiser also introduced multiple other bills in December that target increasing medication costs, including one creating a cost monitoring board and another creating a work group to look at allowing a single statewide insulin purchaser, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: Registered Republican voters in the state have increased since Donald Trump won office but still lag Democrats entering a presidential election year, according to voter registration figures from the secretary of state’s office. Overall registration numbers in West Virginia have fallen as residents continue to leave the state and as elections officials have removed invalid registrations, The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register reports. There were 488,148 registered Democrats in the state at the end of December, a 14.5% drop since November 2016. Meanwhile, there was a 3.2% increase in registered Republicans to 411,872 since the election of Trump, according to secretary of state figures. There also were 278,851 registered voters without a party affiliation, a 4.4% jump from the 2016 election.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has elevated the state to a high flu category after a dramatic increase of cases at Children’s Hospital. Wisconsin had been in the low flu category, but the CDC made the change Thursday. Children’s Wisconsin Hospital said 829 pediatric flu cases were reported in December, which is an increase of nearly 9,000% from December 2018. WISN-TV reports the hospital had nine flu cases and four hospitalizations in December last year. This December, 46 of 829 flu cases have required hospitalizations. “It’s been quite busy in the emergency department,” Aurora West Allis Medical Center Dr. Michael Becker said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A portrait of former Gov. Dave Freudenthal has joined those of other past governors in the Capitol. Freudenthal and other current and former elected officials took part in an unveiling event Friday in the Capitol rotunda. The portrait now hangs in the recently restored building’s east wing, joining those of almost every other former governor who served at least one full term. The exception is Republican Gov. Matt Mead, who served two terms from 2011 to 2019 and whose portrait is still in the works, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. A Democrat, Freudenthal served two terms from 2003 to 2011. Freudenthal and his family unveiled the portrait by Michele Rushworth, who has painted several governors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/27/hemingway-look-alike-shrinking-great-salt-lake-polish-war-hero-news-around-states/117668764/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The founder and chief executive of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama will leave the nonprofit organization at the end of the year, the group said in a statement. Isabel Rubio, who has led the Birmingham-based organization for 20 years, will be replaced by chief operating officer Carlos Aleman, who went to work for the group as deputy director three years ago. The coalition, which advocates for Latino and immigrant families in Alabama, helped lead opposition and provided community services when the state passed a restrictive law dealing with immigrants a decade ago. Court challenges later gutted the law. Growing from a staff of one, the coalition said it now has a staff of more than two dozen bilingual workers who serve more than 5,000 people annually. Rubio has raised more than $19 million to support the Hispanic community with small business development, citizenship, college and home ownership.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A popular strip club that once beckoned customers off a busy highway leading into Anchorage is now a church offering salvation – instead of temptation – behind the daughter of a former exotic dancer. Linda Dunegan believes divine intervention played a hand in transforming the building that housed Fantasies on 5th into the start-up Open Door Baptist Church, turning the show floor into a sanctuary and trading the dancer’s pole with a pulpit. “This church came about because I prayed for five years,” said Dunegan, who tried to buy the building before but walked away – for good, she thought – when she and the owner couldn’t come to terms. Then the owner gave a real estate agent a week to sell it and suggested the agent call Dunegan. This time, the deal went through. “God has been very good to me,” Dunegan said, “to give me a family, a wonderful husband, food on the table, a place to live.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:An Arizona Republican official said ballots stored for the review of the Maricopa County 2020 election were not damaged by water leaking from the ceiling at a state fairgrounds building during Phoenix-area monsoon thunderstorms. “No ballots are at risk,” Randy Pullen, representing state Senate Republicans who ordered the election review, told the Arizona Republic. Pullen said he was at the building when leaks began. He said workers covered boxes with tarps for protection and moved them away from the leaks inside the Weslin Bolin Building as rain poured outside. Pullen identified four leaks above where work is taking place, as well as leaks in other parts of the building. He told the Republic he called fairgrounds management to fix them. The Bolin building is an exhibit hall usually used for trade shows. It is not air-conditioned. The ballot review moved to the building earlier this month after the state Senate’s lease ended at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, also on the fairgrounds property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: COVID-19 continues to rage through Arkansas as new day-over-day cases topped 2,000 for the first time since February. State health officials reported 2,015 new cases Saturday as the highly contagious delta variant swept across the state, prompting the state to resume weekend daily updates. Another 1,022 were reported Sunday. Forty-eight more COVID-19 cases required hospitalization over the weekend, and 13 more deaths were reported. The state averaged 626 new cases a day per 100,000 population over the past two weeks, an increase of 140.7% and a rate that topped the nation’s states, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. Although the Arkansas vaccination rate has been among the nation’s lowest, State Epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that 32,466 first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered last week, the most since late April.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The state has given the University of California, San Diego $35 million to build a coastal research vessel that will focus on such pressing topics as sea-level rise, the health of marine fisheries, ocean acidification, El Nino and the atmospheric rivers that periodically bring damaging storms to California. The university’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography will oversee the design and construction of the 125-foot vessel, which will have a hydrogen-hybrid propulsion system, an emerging technology meant to limit the release of greenhouse gases. The vessel – whose funding comes from the state’s general fund – will primarily sail in California waters, and also will be able to operate with diesel fuel. The ship will be used for research and education, replacing the research vessel Robert Gordon Sproul, which is nearing the end of its 40-year service life. Scripps also operates two large research ships, the Sally Ride and the Roger Revelle, and a small, near-shore vessel, the Bob and Betty Beyster.\n\nColorado\n\nLa Junta:Nine Otero County restaurants received nearly $622,000 in federal COVID-19 relief funding from Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund was designed by Congress as part of this year’s American Rescue Plan Act. About $28.6 billion worth of grants were awarded to restaurants, bars and food trucks throughout the nation. Nearly $500 million was awarded to Colorado alone, according to Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper. Otero County restaurants receiving grants included Copper Kitchen, Eagle’s Lanes & Eagle’s Nest, El Azteca Mexican Restaurant, Felisa’s Mexican Food and Lounge and JJ’s Inc. in La Junta. RPF grants were also given to Frontier Diner in Cheraw, Majestyk, Inc. in Manzanola, Tamarack Grill in Fowler and Rocky Ford’s China Kitchen. No businesses in Crowley or Bent counties received such grants.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut could lag behind most states in regaining hotel jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic, according to projections by a national trade group. The American Hotel and Lodging Association predicted the state will have regained a little less than 72% of its roughly 26,000 direct hotel industry jobs by year’s end. The projected 7,400 unfilled jobs is a more dire forecast than the group made in May, when it predicted a gap of about 5,900 jobs. The group predicted only four states – Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York – and the District of Columbia will regain smaller percentages than Connecticut by the end of 2021. It estimated the hotel industry will end 2021 down about 500,000 jobs compared to 2019 levels. Direct hotel jobs include positions such as housekeeper and front desk attendant but don’t include jobs such as restaurant or retail workers or other small businesses supported by the hotel industry. Experts said vacation and leisure travel in Connecticut has rebounded but business travel has lagged considerably. Business travelers account for roughly 60% of the hotel industry’s customer base.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:No Delaware hospitals – including the state-run psychiatric facility – are complying with federal regulations to post prices on their websites, according to a recent report. This month, Patient Rights Advocate published a report that found that 94.4% of U.S. hospitals are failing to follow the hospital price transparency rule that was put in place during the Trump administration. The list included all of the acute care hospitals in Delaware, as well as a number of behavioral health organizations. In January, hospitals were required to post the costs of services for all payers and plans and have a list or price estimator that calculates the 300 most common services. Before this law went into effect, the hospital industry sued to prevent posting prices but ultimately lost. President Joe Biden earlier this month issued an executive order that told the secretary of Health and Human Services to “support existing hospital price transparency rules.” ChristianaCare, the largest health system in Delaware, said in a statement that it has been “committed to price transparency” and launched its price website in 2018, years before the federal mandate.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. officials are asking people to stay out of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers as summer heat sends many toward local waterways, WUSA-TV reported. “The entire river is inherently dangerous because it looks calm,” said D.C. Fire and EMS Captain Paul O’Conner. “But underneath the moving water ... that looks easy to swim in (are) many obstructions.” Agency spokesperson Vito Maggiolo said three people have accidentally drowned in D.C. waters this year. The most dangerous area is on the northwest edge of the city near Fletcher’s Boathouse, according to Maggiolo. “Strong currents, they’ll pull you under,” he said. “Rocks, you’ll get tossed around. It’s almost like a vortex, being in a washing machine.” If that’s not enough, there’s another reason not to jump into the rivers: It’s illegal. DCFEMS and DC Police confirmed swimming in the Anacostia or Potomac rivers is against the law.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: There’s a new Ernest Hemingway look-alike in Key West. Zach Taylor of Ambrose, Georgia, won this year’s contest to celebrate the author during the island’s annual Hemingway Days festival. The 63-year-old business owner beat out 136 other entrants at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West saloon where Hemingway frequently drank. Competing in the contest is a family affair for Taylor. His late father-in-law, Carlie Coley, was the winner in 2000. His wife and mother-in-law shared his victory celebration Saturday night. “Hemingway has been a fixture of ours since we started coming down to the contest,” Taylor said. “And you know, I think ‘Papa’ would be proud of what’s been accomplished in his name in a town he loved so well.” Saturday night’s competitors paraded across Sloppy Joe’s stage, trying to impress the judging panel of former winners, while the audience cheered and applauded. In 2020, the contest was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Like Taylor, most 2021 entrants attempted to emulate the “Papa” persona adopted by the author in his later years. Some pleaded for victory through poems or song fragments including finalist David “Bat” Masterson, who accompanied his original tune on the harmonica. As well as resembling Hemingway, Taylor said he shares the Nobel Prize-winning author’s passion for fishing, hunting and the life of an outdoorsman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The demolition and removal of an overturned cargo ship along the Georgia coast is inching closer to completion. Crews on Thursday began cutting through steel to remove a sixth chunk of the Golden Ray and take it away on a barge to a facility in Brunswick. Roughly two-thirds of the ship has been removed since demolition began in November. The cut that started Thursday will be the second-to=last one on the project, the Brunswick News reported. Section 6 is about 73 feet long and weighs approximately 3,700 metric tons. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. Investigators concluded the ship tipped over because unstable loading left its center of gravity too high. The entire crew was rescued safely but the ship was deemed a total loss. Demolition of the ship has been slower than officials predicted. The project reached the halfway mark with removal of the fourth section in April. The fifth chunk was cut away in early July.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Testing of drinking water at Hawaii’s public schools found at least 93 faucets and fountains have elevated concentrations of lead. The contaminated water was found among 2,232 sampled taps at 58 schools on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Testing on Oahu began in July, and the results will be released as they become available. An additional four taps with elevated levels of lead were found among 100 sampled sources at 70 child care centers in the state. The results show elevated lead in about 4% of the samples collected so far, officials said. The water testing returned lead concentrations above a project action level of 15 parts per billion. State officials said the compromised fixtures were taken out of commission, and the facilities were notified. Faucet fixtures appeared to be the problem in most cases, but follow-up testing will reveal if plumbing is to blame, said Michael Miyahira, acting branch chief of the Department of Health’s Safe Drinking Water Branch. This is the first time Hawaii’s public schools have been comprehensively tested for lead in drinking water. The state received a $222,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant to do the testing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials are working on a hemp plan to submit to federal officials this fall so that farmers can grow it next year. State Department of Agriculture Deputy Director Chanel Tewalt told the Capital Press last week that the state intends to submit its plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture by Sept. 1. Idaho lawmakers earlier this year approved the growing and selling of hemp products containing 0.3% or less of THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. The State Department of Agriculture plans to submit the hemp plan in early August to Republican Gov. Brad Little and the State Police for their approval. Little, who signed the bill approving hemp in Idaho into law in April, and law enforcement officials have expressed concern that hemp could be used as a cover for growing or transporting marijuana. The overall effort is to align state law with federal law contained in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp. Idaho is the only state that still treats hemp like marijuana. That has prevented Idaho framers from growing hemp, which backers say can be a lucrative crop.\n\nIllinois\n\nWayne: A tick species native to the southeastern part of the United States has been found outside Chicago. Three Gulf Coast ticks were located earlier this month in the Dunham Forest Preserve in Wayne, according to The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald. Wayne is roughly 40 miles west of Chicago. The species is more likely than others to carry the pathogen causing Tidewater spotted fever, which could cause a headache, muscle aches and rash, among other things. “Don’t be scared, be prepared. We don’t need to freak out,” said Holly Tuten, vector ecologist for the Illinois Natural History Survey Medical Entomology Lab at the University of Illinois. The ticks have previously found in more than a dozen Illinois counties, but in small numbers. Then last year, 780 were found in Illinois after researchers found a new way of searching for them, Tuten told the newspaper. However, only adults have been found, suggesting they might not be able to survive Illinois winters. Experts said Gulf Coast ticks can be avoided in the same ways as other ticks. Experts recommend remaining on the center of nature trails and wearing protective clothing when in grassy areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Public beaches along the Lake Monroe shoreline remained closed Friday more than a week after multiple rounds of heavy rain passed through south-central Indiana. The beaches at Fairfax and Paynetown state recreation areas were closed by lake officials after several days of heavy downpours caused widespread flooding in the area. Michael Prier, an office worker at the Paynetown office at Lake Monroe, told The Herald Times that lake waters on Thursday were up 6 feet from typical levels. Days earlier, the lake was 10 feet above normal. Lake Monroe’s public fishing docks also remain closed because of the high water. Some county roads that are used to travel around the lake additionally remain underwater, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Boaters are encouraged by the IDNR to use “extreme caution” on the lake because of possible floating debris and hidden obstacles in the lake. All boat ramps and campgrounds near Lake Monroe remain open.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:More than 100 people gathered outside the state Capitol on Saturday to rally against mandates requiring people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, such as the ones some Iowa hospitals have issued. One of the speakers at the rally, Republican state Rep. Jeff Shipley, called vaccine mandates “a crime against humanity.” People in the crowd held signs that read “stop vax bullying” and “mandates belong in socialist countries.” The event was organized by a group called Informed Choice Iowa that opposes mandatory coronavirus vaccinations and vaccine passports. Brei Johnson with that group told the Des Moines Register that she believes vaccinations should be discussed between a health professional and patient, not made a condition of employment. “You can take off a mask but you can’t undo a vaccine. That’s a slippery slope to what comes next,” Johnson said. Earlier this month, the owner of seven MercyOne hospitals and related clinics said all employees would be required to get vaccinated or risk termination. The hospitals and clinics are in Clinton, Dubuque, Dyersville, Mason City, New Hampton, Primghar and Sioux City. The Iowa Department of Public Health said nearly 47% of Iowa residents have been fully vaccinated against the virus.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A retired University of Kansas professor received Poland’s Medal of Valor this weekend more than 75 years after he fought with the Polish resistance against the occupying forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. Polish Air Force Major Gen. Cezary Wisniewski who is based at the Polish embassy in Washington, visited Jarek Piekalkiewicz’s home in Lawrence on Saturday to give him Poland’s second-highest combat honor on his 95th birthday. Wisniewski said the honor was overlooked during the war and then the post-war communist government of Poland refused to honor the country’s wartime resistance fighters. The recommendation that Piekalkiewicz receive the medal for his efforts was recently discovered in Poland’s archives, according to the Lawrence Journal-World. Piekalkiewicz joined the Polish resistance at age 16. Two years later, he was promoted to platoon sergeant and commanded 1,000 men during the bloody uprising of 1944 when roughly 6,000 resistance soldiers were killed before the resistance surrendered in October when its forces ran short of ammunition and food. Piekalkiewicz said he then became a prisoner of war at a German labor camp, and he tried to escape three times before he finally succeeded. Later, he served with the U.S. Army and British military. After the war, he earned his bachelor’s degree and met his wife at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, before coming to the United States and earning his doctorate. He went on to teach at KU from 1963 to 2000,\n\nKentucky\n\nIrvine: State officials have celebrated the opening of a $14.7 million technology center serving Estill, Powell and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. The center will serve high school and technical college students and provide training for displaced workers seeking new career paths. Gov. Andy Beshear participated in the recent grand opening, along with state Education Commissioner Jason Glass and Senate President Robert Stivers. Beshear praised the “forward thinking of leaders that laid the groundwork” for the project. The Estill County Area Technology Center will serve about 300 students from Estill, Powell and surrounding counties, Beshear’s office said. It will house six career and technical programs and will be home to the Estill County Success/Virtual Academy. “Technical centers, like the new Estill County Area Technology Center, are key to preparing the future workforce of Kentucky,” Glass said. “Our students will develop the latest and most in-demand skills in high demand areas, including health and computer sciences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Republican U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, a critic of mask mandates and public health restrictions during the pandemic, said he, his wife and son have contracted the coronavirus. He made the announcement on Facebook on Sunday night. He said he and his wife had been infected last year, but this time around is much more difficult. He has not said whether he has been vaccinated. “This episode is far more challenging. It has required all my devoted energy,” he said. “We are all under excellent care, and our prognosis is positive.” Higgins is the second member of Congress to announce in the last week that they contracted the virus. Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican who represents parts of southwest Florida, said July 19 that he had tested positive. Buchanan said he had been fully vaccinated and was experiencing mild symptoms. Higgins has said he doesn’t support mask mandates or mandatory vaccines. In a May Facebook post, Higgins said: “If you want to get vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don’t, then don’t. That’s your right as a free American.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some unemployment claimants in Maine and elsewhere will soon have to submit proof that they were employed when they lost a job because of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government is requiring the proof of employment by Aug. 4 for people who have received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. The rule applies to anyone who has received the benefits beginning with the week that ended Jan 2. The Maine Department of Labor said claimants must submit the proof of employment as soon as possible to avoid a denial of benefits. Overpayment of benefits would require the claimant to repay benefits, the department said. There were 100 initial claims filed for federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in Maine in the week that ended July 17.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Colleges and universities in Maryland are adjusting computer software and hiring additional staff to manage vaccination records for COVID-19 ahead of the fall semester. The Baltimore Sun reported administrators are devising plans to verify compliance with vaccine mandates and to process applications for an exemption. Earlier this year,14 schools across the state said they would require students and employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before the fall. Some schools have collected immunization records for years. But they’re now doing so on a larger scale and will include employees. Unvaccinated students who lack an exemption might not be allowed to live on campus or access campus facilities. Some could also see their registration for courses canceled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Rachael Rollins, who has pushed for progressive criminal justice reforms as the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts, has been nominated by President Joe Biden to become the state’s top federal prosecutor. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Rollins, who has led the Suffolk County district attorneys office since 2019, would become the first Black woman to serve as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. Rollins defeated the district attorney candidate backed by the longtime incumbent and police groups in the 2018 Democratic primary on a promise to decline prosecution for certain low-level crimes. She argued people shouldn’t be jailed for crimes that result from mental health or addiction problems and said she wanted to focus her attention on serious crimes, like homicides. Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, who recommended Rollins for the job, said they are “certain that she will be a tremendous U.S. attorney” and pledged to work to make sure she’s confirmed as quickly as possible.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:The National Weather Service said tornadoes struck near Detroit and near Flint on Saturday night. The EF-1 tornadoes touched down in Genesee County’s Clayton Township about 6:30 p.m. and in Oakland County about 7:45 p.m., the weather service said. Damage from both storms was consistent with winds of 100 mph and they traveled about 1.8 miles, damaging trees. One person suffered minor injuries. Thousands of utility customers in the Detroit area had no power Sunday following a night of severe storms. DTE Energy reported nearly 135,000 customers in Oakland and Macomb counties had no service at 10:20 a.m. because of wind damage. Consumers Energy reported more than 650 customers without power in Oakland County’s Holly Township at 9:45 a.m. DTE had more than 500 crews in the field and “will be working around the clock to restore power to impacted customers as quickly and safely as possible,” the utility reported on its website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota officially adopted regulations championed by Gov. Tim Walz to encourage the switchover to electric vehicles. The “clean car” rules published in the State Register take effect in 2024 with the 2025 model year. They will require manufacturers and dealers to supply more electric vehicles for the Minnesota marketplace. The Walz administration said the rules will lead to cleaner air and help fight climate change by increasing the choices Minnesotans have for purchasing electric cars. It said the changes will protect public health and save Minnesotans money at the pump. But Scott Lambert, president of the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, said the rules put California in charge of writing Minnesota’s regulations because the state is essentially adopting California’s standards, and can’t modify them under federal law. He said the changes will swamp Minnesota dealers with more electric vehicles than customers want to buy, and force up car prices for everyone.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Education will temporarily move out of its headquarters in the old Central High School building in downtown Jackson so repairs can be made to alleviate repeated leaks and flooding. The department will lease office space at South Pointe Business Park in the Jackson suburb of Clinton, officials said in a news release Monday. Some employees will start working there sometime in mid-August, and others will work remotely. The department said phone numbers and email addresses for all staff will remain the same. This is the second time in recent years for the Department of Education to temporarily move to South Pointe. The first time was in 2015, when a fire in a downtown Jackson hotel damaged the old Central High building. Those repairs were completed after a year. The Legislature will have to set aside money for the new repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis area has become one of the first in the country to reinstate mask requirements amid a rise in cases that health officials are blaming on low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant. Despite pushback from some elected officials, face coverings became mandatory Monday in indoor public places and on public transportation in St. Louis city and St. Louis County for everyone age 5 or older – even for those who are vaccinated. Wearing masks outdoors is strongly encouraged, especially in group settings. “For those who are vaccinated this may feel like punishment, punishment for doing the right thing,” St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, said at a news conference Monday. “I’ve heard that and I feel that frustration. While the vaccination can protect against serious illness, it can’t protect you from being infected with COVID-19 and passing it onto someone else, someone who may be more vulnerable.” The decision came as both of Missouri’s urban areas have seen a big uptick in coronavirus hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. Missouri ranks fourth nationally in the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nCascade:The Cascade County Sheriff’s Department has issued a pre-evacuation warning for “everything south of Cascade” in advance of a wildfire, Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said in a text Sunday afternoon. “A pre-evacuation warning has been issued for the Sheep Creek Lane area, everything south of Cascade,” Slaughter said in the text. “Deputies are being called in to make notifications.” Also, the County Sheriff’s Department and the Montana Highway Patrol were conducting pre-evacuation warnings for the northern part of the Belt Creek Drainage as well as the town of Monarch being threatened by another wildfire as of 6:47 p.m. Sunday. According to the Inciweb website, that fire started Friday at about noon by lightning about 10 miles southeast of Cascade and has since grown to 3,623 acres. It is east of the Dearborn Rest Area on Interstate 15 at the Cascade-Lewis and Clark County Line. A total of 132 firefighting personnel were on the scene, including two Type 1 hotshot crews and three Type 2 Initial Attack Crews, along with three bulldozers and five fire engines. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is coordinating with the Cascade County Sheriff’s Department and multiple volunteer fire departments in Cascade County.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Four people were injured when a second-floor outdoor deck collapsed during a barbecue, trapping the people and leaving serious burns on one woman when a hot charcoal grill fell on her. First responders said the incident happened about 9 p.m. Sunday at a home in Bellevue. Several people were on the deck when it collapsed, officials said, causing them to fall 10- to 12-feet to the ground. Four people, including the woman with first- and second-degree burns, were taken to local hospitals. Officials said some people at the scene declined treatment.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:The airport serving Nevada’s second-largest metro area faces a shortage of jet fuel that could force the cancellation of cargo and passenger fights, potentially restricting the flow of tourists and essential goods into the northern part of the state. Nevada’s political leaders issued a statement late Saturday pledging to minimize disruption at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and ensure the aerial fight against Western wildfires isn’t hampered. Besides serving Reno, a popular gambling destination, the airport is the nearest passenger terminal to Lake Tahoe. “To be clear, further failure to secure adequate fuel supplies is unacceptable,” wrote Gov. Steve Sisolak, Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei. Airport officials across West have voiced concerns about jet fuel shortages and their effect on what is shaping up to be a busy wildfire season. Jet fuel demand declined sharply and supply chains atrophied during the coronavirus pandemic, according to aviation supply companies, jet fuel transport companies and others. They have yet to bounce back in the West even as the economy picks up and people flock to airports for long-delayed trips.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMoultonborough: Parents are demanding answers after a summer camp that called itself one of the best in the nation unexpectedly shut down after just six days this month. Officials at Camp Quinebarge notified parents in early July that they needed to pick up their children after delays in food shipments made it impossible to continue, The Boston Globe reported. All remaining sessions for the overnight camp were canceled. But some parents told The Globe that problems appeared to go beyond food deliveries. Stories surfaced about counselors who were hired days before camp with little training. Campers reported that multiple meals were served on dirty dishes. Some parents said their children were quarantined after they vomited and that the parents were not notified. The camp’s executive director, Eric Carlson, apologized to parents but said the closure was tied to industry-wide staffing and supply chain problems and not because of any long-term problems with the camp’s operations. The camp had been licensed to operate by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, but it closed before an in-season inspection was performed, a department spokesperson told The Globe. Some parents have said they deserve a full accounting of what happened at the 85-year-old camp, which costs $3,400 for two weeks. Although some defend the camp, some have swapped horror stories on a Facebook group for aggrieved parents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack:Advocacy groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security against the Bergen County Jail on behalf of 15 current and former inmates, with allegations of sexual assault, medical and physical abuse, religious discrimination, COVID-19 negligence and generally “deplorable” conditions. The complaint called for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end its agreement with the jail and release all immigrants detained at the facility. Freedom for Immigrants, the Center for Constitutional Rights and UnLocal jointly filed the complaint. It includes testimonies from current and former inmates, some who kept anonymous because of fear of retaliation. One inmate told Freedom For Immigrants’ hotline that a correctional officer sexually assaulted him, and then was told by the officer “you can’t do anything about it.”At least three inmates complained of medical neglect. One man said he was diagnosed with HPV and diabetes while in jail, and since then has been denied proper treatment for both ailments. Another said he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013, but after having an X-ray conducted by a doctor at the jail, he was told everything was “fine,” despite feeling constant pain. The Bergen County Sheriff’s Office had previously denied similar allegations. Regarding this complaint, the sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Indian Resources Development at New Mexico State University, in partnership with Navajo Technical University, received a four-year, $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture to develop experiential learning opportunities to increase retention and graduation of Native American students at New Mexico land-grant institutions. Housed in NMSU’s College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Indian Resources Development and NTU were awarded the grant with support of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, American Indian Chamber of Commerce, Flower Hill Institute and the Navajo Nation Department of Natural Resources. The project will offer experiential learning opportunities that foster connections between Native American students’ cultural background and their academic experiences along with relevant real-world internships, professional development and career exploration opportunities. Mentors from regional land-grant institutions, Tribal entities and Native professionals also will collaborate on the project.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city will require all of its municipal workers – including teachers and police officers – to get coronavirus vaccines by mid-September or face weekly coronavirus testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The rule is expected to affect about 340,000 city employees, making the city one of the largest employers in the U.S. to take such action. Although it isn’t a vaccine mandate – no workers will be forced to take a shot – officials hope the inconvenience and discomfort of weekly tests will persuade many to overcome a reluctance to get inoculated. “This is about our recovery. This is about what we need to do to bring back New York City,” de Blasio said. “This is about keeping people safe.” The Sept. 13 deadline coincides with the start of public school, when the Democratic mayor has said he expects all pupils to be in classrooms full-time. City health care workers and employees in congregate setting such as group homes will face earlier deadlines. The move came as the city fights a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Since the end of June, the daily average of new cases has increased by more than 300%.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Officials said no one was seriously injured when a small airplane flipped over onto its roof shortly after landing at the Ocracoke Island Airport on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, a news release from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore said. The single-engine airplane came to rest in grass near the end of the runway, and emergency officials responded. Neither the pilot nor passenger required transport to a hospital, according to the news release. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified and no further details were immediately available.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Department of Transportation has added dozens of self-serve kiosks across the state to help residents avoid what can sometimes be a long wait at motor vehicle stations. The DOT has completed adding 44 kiosks, an effort it began earlier this year. Residents can now use 52 kiosks to renew a license, request a replacement license or ID card, schedule a road test, pay a reinstatement fee, change an address and edit donor registry information, the Bismarck Tribune reported. They also can check the status of their license, driving record and commercial driver’s license medical card. An initial REAL ID card isn’t available at the kiosk, but its renewal is possible. “The new driver’s license kiosk upgrades add another convenient option for customers doing business with the NDDOT and also expands services into rural communities,” DOT Director Bill Panos said. Motor vehicle registration renewals, nonresident temporary registration requests and applying for a mobility impairment placard are also available at the kiosks.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doesn’t plan to mandate masks in schools this fall, but health officials strongly recommend students and staff wear face coverings if they aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer said. That and other recommended steps are essential to protecting children and ensuring a successful school year as students return to classrooms, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said. Some of Ohio’s largest districts, including Columbus and Cleveland, already decided to require masks for everyone when the school year begins. Others are still navigating the complicated decision-making and polarization around mask rules as the delta variant spreads and cases rise. The health department is strongly urging school employees and eligible students age 12 and older to get vaccinated. That is the best protection, Vanderhoff said. Health officials also are recommending schools continue additional measures that have proven helpful, such as keeping extra distance between people indoors, improving ventilation, sanitizing and encouraging good hand-washing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTaft: A state prison inmate serving a sentence for escape was recaptured less than five hours after escaping a minimum security prison in eastern Oklahoma on Saturday, according to the State Department of Corrections. Robert Youngblood, 41, was taken into custody about noon after escaping the Jess Dunn Correctional Center in Taft about 7 a.m., according to a statement from the department. The department said Youngblood was seen by staff leaving the prison grounds on foot. The department said Youngblood was serving time for escape from a Logan County jail. DOC records showed Youngblood’s previous convictions included drug possession and distribution, false personation, obstructing an officer and robbery.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Rescue teams continued their search Sunday for a Salem climber who plummeted several hundred feet while descending Mount Jefferson on Friday. The \"intense\" search for Steven Vanpelt, 33, was in its third day after Marion County Sheriff's deputies initially responded to a call from the Pamelia Lake trailhead just off Oregon Highway 22 at 11:36 a.m. Friday. Linn County Sheriff’s Office took over command of the operation at about 3:30 p.m. that day. Linn County officials said Vanpelt was descending Mount Jefferson when he fell \"among extreme mountainous terrain.\" A witness told deputies they lost sight of Vanpelt after he plummeted several hundred feet. Vanpelt has not yet been found because of the dangerous terrain consisting of snow, cliffs, large boulders, crevices and rock scree, which calls for technical mountaineers, officials said. Search-and-rescue efforts on and near the mountain often require multiple counties because of the resources needed and county borders in the area. Corvallis Mountain Rescue, Eugene Mountain Rescue, Deschutes Mountain Rescue and Portland Mountain Rescue are helping with the efforts, Linn County Sheriff's Office authorities said. LifeFlight crews and the Army National Guard have also conducted multiple flights to search the terrain in the days following the initial report.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTredyffrin Township:A Republican candidate for governor has denied he caused an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week in which a Bradford County motorcyclist was killed. Charlie Gerow, 66, was involved in an accident Wednesday night in Chester County. A highway construction worker told Spotlight PA that he saw a car later identified as Gerow's traveling on the other side of the turnpike with a motorcycle wedged into its grill. State police closed the turnpike for 7 hours after the accident. No charges have been filed. The Chester County coroner’s office said the victim was Logan Carl Abbott, 30. The cause of death was multiple blunt impacts and toxicology tests on the victim are pending, Chester County Coroner Christina VandePol told the Associated Press. Gerow’s campaign posted a statement to its website on Friday that said he is “cooperating fully with the investigation and will continue to do so.” The statement said Gerow “looks forward to the State Police completing their investigation and is confident that the investigation will confirm that he was not the cause of the accident.” The campaign statement said Gerow has been advised to not discuss the accident until police have completed their investigation. State police released a crash report that did not identify anyone involved, but reported that a fatal crash occurred in the turnpike’s westbound lanes in Tredyffrin Township at about 9:50 p.m. Wednesday. Police said the crash involved a Honda motorcycle and a Mercedes Benz 300. The westbound lanes were closed until 4:45 a.m.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: The easing of rules on outdoor dining that proved to be a crucial lifeline for many Rhode Island restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic were extended Monday during a ceremonial bill signing by Gov. Daniel McKee. The law signed outside Meldgie’s Diner in Narragansett puts a moratorium until April 1 on enforcement of municipal ordinances or zoning requirements that would penalize restaurant and bar owners for modifying their premises to allow for outdoor dining. “When something works and makes sense, you continue it,” the Democratic governor said at the ceremony attended by the legislative sponsors of the bill as well as several bar and restaurant owners. “That is what this legislation is all about: allowing these outdoor seating arrangements to continue so we can support small, locally-owned restaurants that have faced numerous challenges since the outset of the pandemic.” Mark Eldridge, co-owner of three Meldgie’s Diner locations, said the challenges of COVID-19 have been “overwhelming,” but his restaurants have stayed afloat thanks to local, state and federal aid programs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: The Spartanburg County Council voted to ends its $25-a-year road fee in the wake of a state Supreme Court decision tossing a similar fee out in neighboring Greenville County. There have been other attempts in recent years to repeal the fee passed in 2005 to pay for road and bridge maintenance, but the high court ruling sealed its fate, County Council Chairman Manning Lynch said. The County Council will need to vote two more times to officially end the fee, the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg reported. The fee generates about $7 million a year and Lynch said he thinks the county can find money in its general budget to replace the fees.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen:A federal contempt of court trial involving three members of the U.S. Marshals Service has been moved from Aberdeen to Sioux Falls, according to court documents. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow on May 10after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The trial was originally set for Sept. 13 in Aberdeen, but will now begin Dec. 14 in Sioux Falls. U.S. District Judge Brian C. Buescher, who is presiding over the case, said Sioux Falls is a more convenient place for proceedings for all parties involved in the case, the Aberdeen American News reported. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann, who filed the criminal contempt of court and obstruction of justice charges, has dropped out of the case. Buescher is based in Nebraska. In court documents recusing himself from the case, Kornmann wrote that Department of Justice policies should not trump lawful federal court order and the case “has nothing to do with requiring anyone to be fully vaccinated.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:The Tennessee Department of Transportation said it will likely be early August before the Interstate 40 bridge between Arkansas and Tennessee can reopen to traffic. Contractors are working on Phase 3 of the repairs that began after a crack was found in May in the Hernando DeSoto Bridge over the Mississippi River. Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright previously said construction was expected to run into at least late July. The department said Friday it would have a more schedule information this week about reopening. All interstate traffic in the Memphis area is being diverted to I-55. The 47-year-old, six-lane bridge was shut down May 11 after inspectors found a crack in one of two 900-foot horizontal steel beams crucial for the bridge’s structural integrity.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: Party attendees beat a man to death with bricks early Monday after he opened fire, police said. Another person was shot and killed and three were injured. Fort Worth police were called to the 5600 block of Shiloh Drive about 1 a.m. Witnesses told police that a small gathering was being held in a backyard. One of the attendees became upset and left the gathering before returning with another person. Both started arguing with other partygoers, authorities said. Police did not describe what caused the initial altercation. The party attendee pulled a gun and shot one person, authorities said. The victim was not seriously injured. Other people at the party chased the shooter, authorities said. While the shooter turned and fired at the crowd, a group picked up landscaping bricks and started throwing them at the shooter. The shooter ended up on the ground – it’s not known whether he tripped or was tackled – and continued shooting. One person was killed by that round of gunfire, and another was injured, authorities said. “The shooter was struck multiple times with at least one landscaping brick and was pronounced dead at the scene,” authorities said. Police have not released the identities of anybody involved, nor have they said whether any charges will be filed. A handgun was recovered by police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The water levels at the Great Salt Lake have hit a historic low, a grim milestone for the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi River that comes as a severe drought grips the region. On Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey announced average daily water levels had dropped about an inch below the previous record of 4,191.4 feet, which was set in 1963. The new record came months earlier than when the lake typically hits its lowest level of the year, indicating water levels could continue to drop further, said Candice Hasenyager, the deputy director of Utah’s Division of Water Resources. Receding water already is affecting a nesting spot for pelicans, which are among the millions of birds dependent on the lake. Sailboats have been hoisted out of the water to keep them from getting stuck in mud.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The city council has postponed a vote on whether to allow people experiencing homelessness to camp in city parks. Late last week, the council discussed a proposed policy looking at the needs of the homeless and the city, including where emergency sleeping would be located when the local shelter is full, WCAX-TV reported. The proposal also addressed what park staff should do if they find someone sleeping in an unapproved location, such as on school grounds, private property or near a public path, the station reported. The goal is to protect the homeless while adding boundaries, officials said. “If the shelters are open and there’s a place for someone to go, and they’re camping in a high sensitivity area, we would ask them to leave that area, so they can go to a shelter that’s more appropriate and safe,” Montpelier Homelessness Task Force staff representative Cameron Niedermayer said. The Homelessness Task Force will be considering suggestions from the public and working with the parks commission before the council’s next meeting on Aug. 18.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Lifeguards in Virginia Beach are warning people against diving into murky and shallow water at the oceanfront in the wake of three people reporting spinal cord injuries this year. Tom Gill, chief of the Virginia Beach Lifesaving Service, told The Virginian-Pilot last week that if “you can’t see what you’re diving into, you shouldn’t dive into it.” Chad Rosenbrock dived into the surf in June and reportedly hit his head. The impact broke several vertebrae. The 46-year-old Navy veteran was paralyzed from the chest down. Virginia Beach saw six suspected spinal injuries in 2020, three in 2019, two in 2018 and seven in 2017. Most injuries are fairly minor. And less than 10% result in paralysis. But doctors say they’re all preventable.\n\nWashington\n\nBainbridge Island:A juvenile male sixgill shark measuring more than 9 feet long washed up on Rockaway Beach, and the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife responded to conduct a necropsy. “It was such a surprise to me,” said John Keller, who lives next to Mackenzie. “I fish out here and have fished out here a long time. I’ve never believed or even thought that there were sharks in the water other than dogfish. I’ve been out salmon fishing, I’ve caught more than my share of dogfish, but to see something like this … that’s just an amazing critter out here in this water.” Lisa Hillier, a biologist with the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, was among those who examined the shark and found that the shark was killed after ingesting fishing gear, with lead weights and hooks. The shark was the third to wash up on a beach in the region this year, she said. “We do get washups occasionally, sometimes one or two a year. Having three is not unusual, but let’s just hope that it stops there,” Hillier said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Coupon books are now available offering discounts on lodging, dining, activities and merchandise at West Virginia state parks. The coupon books cost $25 and are available for purchase online and at park and forest gift shops across the state, the Department of Commerce said in a news release. Among the offers are 30% off lodging at a state park; a 50% discount on a second Pipestem Peaks Zipline Tour when a first one is purchased; 30% off any item at any state park gift shop, and 15% off any breakfast, lunch or dinner for two at Tygart Lake State Park’s Lodge Restaurant. “One of the greatest parts of vacationing in our state parks and forests is that it’s affordable and this coupon book is going to make trips even better,” said West Virginia State Parks Chief Brad Reed. Coupon books ordered online will be mailed within three business days. The state parks system includes 35 parks, nine forests and two rail trails.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A southeastern Wisconsin school district failed to properly investigate a parent’s allegations of racism at its high school last year, the state Department of Public Instruction concluded. DPI officials concluded that the Cedarburg School District failed to establish enough facts to make any determinations and ordered the district to launch a new investigation. According to the DPI decision, parent Jessie Mchomvu filed a complaint with the district in October alleging her bi-racial child heard another high school student praise Kyle Rittenhouse and vowing to drive a vehicle through a Black Lives Matter protest. Rittenhouse, who is white, shot and killed two people during a protest over police brutality in Kenosha last August. He’s set to stand trial in November on homicide charges. Mchomvu also alleged that her child frequently heard a racial slur for Black people in the hallways, students displayed Confederate flags on their vehicles and wore clothing with messages supporting police and Donald Trump. The district hired an outside investigator to look into the complaint. The investigator determined there was no evidence of racial harassment or bullying after interviewing Mchomvu and one district employee. The district adopted the investigator’s conclusion.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A recently retired U.S. senator from Wyoming remained hospitalized in uncertain condition Monday, three days after a bicycle accident outside his hometown. The accident Friday night near Gillette sent Mike Enzi, 77, to a hospital, where he was stabilized before being life-flighted to a hospital in Loveland, Colorado, Enzi’s family said in a statement. Details of the accident and the extent of Enzi’s injuries remained unknown, the statement said. Reached by phone, officials at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, didn’t immediately have an update on Enzi’s condition Monday. Enzi’s son, Brad, disclosed the accident Saturday on Twitter. Enzi, a Republican, retired in January after four terms as senator. He previously was a state lawmaker and mayor of Gillette, where he owned a shoe store.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/27"}]}

How I learned to love 'the music of the night.'\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber honors son during emotional curtain call\n\nStars came out in full force for the last performance of \"Phantom,\" which tells the story of a masked composer who haunts a Paris opera house and falls in love with a young singer named Christine Daaé.\n\nGlenn Close was spotted grabbing champagne during intermission, and Lin-Manuel Miranda snapped selfies and Sara Bareilles chatted with fellow theatergoers. Gayle King filmed the cast's final bows on her smartphone, not long before Webber joined Sarah Brightman – his former partner and the show's original Christine – for a moving curtain call speech.\n\nLate last month, Webber's eldest son, Nicholas, died at 43 after a battle with gastric cancer. \"I hope you won't mind if I dedicate this performance to my son,\" Webber said onstage. \"When he was a little boy, he heard some of this music and he loved it.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did,\" Brightman said. \"When Andrew was writing it, he was right there, so his soul is with us. Nick, we love you very much.\"\n\nThe performance itself was also highly emotional. Emilie Kouatchou, the first Black actress to play Christine full time on Broadway, smiled through tears as she received a midshow standing ovation for her gorgeous rendition of \"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again.\" The show's heart-tugging last moments were met with resounding sniffles from the audience, while iconic props such as the Phantom's boat and monkey music box were greeted with whoops and cheers.\n\nThe chandelier has descended on 'The Phantom of the Opera' after 35 years on Broadway\n\n'The Phantom of the Opera' is the 'grandfather of Broadway'\n\nOn the red carpet before the performance, cast members past and present hailed \"Phantom\" for its astounding legacy. The show arrived in New York in 1988 as part of the \"British invasion\" of Broadway, helping usher in a new age of megamusicals with spectacular set pieces and thumping pop-rock scores. Directed by Hal Prince, the production won seven Tony Awards, including best musical, and its songs have been memorably covered by everyone from Barbra Streisand to Josh Groban.\n\n'Sweeney Todd' review:Josh Groban is a cutthroat crooner in spectacular Broadway revival\n\n\"This is like the grandfather of Broadway,\" says John Riddle, who plays Christine's suitor Raoul. \"It's the standard for what the type of scale a show can be. It's the end of an era.\"\n\n\"It certainly did change what a Broadway musical can be,\" adds Laird Mackintosh, who stepped in to play the Phantom for principal Ben Crawford, who was out sick and on vocal rest. \"It has a wow factor and a magic and a theatricality that hasn't changed since the '80s. It's still an incredibly potent piece of theater.\"\n\n'It's only a matter of time' until 'Phantom' returns to New York\n\nAs with many other shows, ticket sales for \"Phantom\" lagged when Broadway reopened after COVID-19. But the musical got a massive box-office boost when Mackintosh and Webber announced its closing, earning a record $3 million in a single week last month and playing to standing-room-only audiences.\n\n\"It's just amazing what has happened in the last few months,\" Webber said during the confetti-filled curtain call. \"I don't think any of us thought the 'Phantom' would go out with quite the bang that it has. Maybe it'll come back – you never know.\"\n\nMackintosh similarly teased the show's inevitable New York return, saying, \"It's only a matter of time.\"\n\n\"The one question I keep getting asked again and again – will the Phantom return?\" Mackintosh said onstage. \"Having been a producer for over 55 years, I’ve seen all the great musicals return. And 'Phantom' is one of the greatest.\"\n\n'Phantom of the Opera' postpones end of long Broadway run to April after ticket sales spike\n\nThe music of the night is more powerful than ever, judging by the hundreds of fans in \"Phantom\" masks and T-shirts who waited for hours outside the Majestic Theatre on Sunday. The show has even gained popularity on TikTok, thanks in part to Webber's playful presence on the platform.\n\n\"I don't feel it's the end,\" Brightman said on the red carpet. \"It's become a classic, and you know this because you watch all the new generations coming up and they're really enjoying it. The fact that so many people from this generation want to see this, it means it's going to be back.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/06/04/meet-man-brings-broadway-town/28511611/", "title": "Meet the man who brings Broadway to town", "text": "Chris Kocher\n\nckocher@gannett.com | @RealChrisKocher\n\nFor 35 years, NAC Entertainment has presented touring Broadway shows at the Forum in Binghamton — and under the leadership of its founder and president, Albert Nocciolino, the company's reach has extended to nine cities in upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania, including the Clemens Center in Elmira.\n\nNocciolino also has invested in dozens of Broadway shows and tours both as a producer and as a founding member and president of the Independent Presenters Network. He has won four Tony Awards since 2002, for his behind-the-scenes role in \"Kinky Boots,\" \"La Cage aux Folles,\" \"Spamalot\" and \"Thoroughly Modern Millie.\"\n\nThe Binghamton native spoke about his career last month at NAC's headquarters, a former mansion on Riverside Drive that now houses offices crammed with the Broadway memorabilia. A dozen employees help him manage the various aspects of his business.\n\n\"I often make the analogy that it's like a poker table — I have a seat at the table, I still have a bunch of chips in front of me and I haven't busted yet,\" he said. \"Some hands I win, some hands I lose, but I've been able to play.\"\n\nQUESTION: Tell me about growing up in Binghamton.\n\nANSWER: I grew up right in the heart of the urban core. My parents were immigrants from Italy — it was my sister, my parents and me. We spoke Italian before we spoke English! I grew up on Fayette Street in downtown Binghamton. Until I was 11, I went to Christopher Columbus (Elementary) School, moved over to the South Side and went to MacArthur for a few years, then I graduated from Binghamton Central (High School). I played a lot of sports, and I also ushered at the old Capital Theater and was a member of the Drama Club. It was an unusual combination in those days.\n\nI remember seeing my first Broadway play on a Catholic Youth Organization trip when I was 13 or 14 years old, to see Joe Namath as \"The Rookie\" and to see Sammy Davis Jr. in \"Golden Boy.\"\n\nWe were organizing the high school dances with the Spanish Club, and it was a dollar to get in — but when the band would take a break, that's when trouble would break out. There'd be a fight or something else. So the principal said to me, \"No more dances because we're having too much trouble when the band takes a break.\" I said, \"I have a solution — let's book two bands and charge $2. I'll put one on one end of the gym and one at the other end. We'll lock the door, and whoever leaves can't come back.\" We made more money, and the whole Spanish Club went to Puerto Rico!\n\nWhen I was in college at University of Pennsylvania, I ended up running the student ticket agency. This is when Ticketron was just getting started, so we would buy season tickets to the Phillies or the 76ers, to the Philadelphia Orchestra and all the other events around down. We'd bring them back to our students so they could go see the cultural and sports activities around town. I also got involved in managing the concerts on campus.\n\nQ: That gave you an early taste of the business side of entertainment.\n\nA: Oh yes. When I graduated from the Wharton School, I took a job with the Irving Trust in New York City. Then my dad was sick, so I came home for spring break trying to figure out what we were going to do.\n\nI met the guy who was managing the new arena — he was getting a haircut right next to me. I was 21 years old. The lady who was cutting my hair was an old friend and she introduced me to Charlie Theokus.\n\nWe got talking, I went to his office for a cup of coffee, and he said, \"What are you doing this week?\" \"I'm home for spring break.\" He said, \"I could use some help if you want to help me.\" They were ready to install the seats at the Arena and no one had been able to come up with a seating chart. The chart that's still at the Arena, I created 40 years ago as a senior in college during my spring break!\n\nHe offered me a job, and I ended up working two and a half years for him doing everything. We had the Miss World USA beauty pageant for the first two years I was there, and then I managed it for the sponsoring organizations — the Broome County Chamber of Commerce and the B.C. Open. ABC ended up hiring me to be the production coordinator for three or four years after that, so I would go out every year and do that.\n\nWhile I was still on staff, we renovated the Forum — which was the Capri Theater. In an effort to bring shows to town, I started developing and nurturing new promoters. One promoter brought Roberta Flack here, and Charlie told me to find an opening act — so Barry Manilow had a new song out called \"Mandy,\" so I booked him for seven or eight dates to be her opening act.\n\nAfter two and a half years, I was all of 24 but I thought I needed to do something else. When I was leaving, I had an agent call me — a guy who ended up being a partner and an old friend — and he called asking if anyone would be interested in doing a one-night engagement at the Forum for \"Charley's Aunt\" with Vincent Price and Roddy McDowell. I said, \"Yeah, I'll do it!\" and I sold it out!\n\nThat's how it all started. The following year, I re-created the Broadway Theater League in Binghamton and put together four touring Broadway shows at the Forum. That was 39 years ago.\n\nAlong the way, it was not easy. You get that first bite of success and then you realize that's not the way it always is. Not every show has Vincent Price in it, so when you bring in \"Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope\" and there are only 400 people in the house, you still have to pay the same bills.\n\nI learned along the way, so we created an entertainment marketing arm, and we started doing the marketing and advertising for all the family shows — Ice Capades, WWF, Harlem Globetrotters, the circus — in five or six markets around the state. It was paying the bills as we started to add one city after another (for Broadway shows). We added some cities like Springfield, Mass., and that didn't work — we had to get out of there. Then we went to Erie, Pa., and we're still there. We kept expanding, and now we're in nine markets.\n\nIf you were to take a compass and put the point in Binghamton and swing it, we're in the middle. New York City is 200 miles away, Buffalo is 200 miles away, Syracuse and Scranton and Elmira are each an hour away — Binghamton is slam in the middle, completely by accident. It wasn't strategically planned!\n\nIn an effort to get more \"vertically integrated\" — although I hate that term — I started getting more involved in producing and investing in Broadway shows and tours.\n\nQ: What is your role bringing Broadway shows to regional theaters?\n\nA: We're no different from a concert promoter. We're the one who finds a show, agrees to pay for it, rents a venue, markets it and produces it that day. We pay 100 percent of all the bills and take 100 percent of all the risks, and then we hope when the lights go out and the curtain goes up that there are enough butts in the seats.\n\nWhat we can't do tomorrow is sell anything at half price. We sell a diminishing asset that diminishes to zero when the show starts. There's risk, but to reduce that risk, the theater industry — no different from the classical music business or the opera — developed a subscription model, and that's where the biggest and best growth has been in the touring theater business.\n\nThere was a time when a show would go on the road and the show just wasn't selling tickets, so the next 10 cities would find out how you did and say, \"I'm not doing the show.\" Now, when you have a subscription, you have a commitment to your venue and to your community and to your subscribers. With that commitment comes continuity, comes credibility, comes trust. There's an assurance the show is going to happen. Yes, some of them won't do as well as others, but nobody gets killed like they used to. We may not make any money — we may lose just a little — but at least there's a show.\n\nIt also boosted the quality of shows, because producers recognized that they have number of cities they're traveling to, so they could invest in a show and try to duplicate as much as possible what they created on Broadway.\n\nQ: You also produce shows on Broadway.\n\nA: Yes, in all different shapes and forms of participation. I have been involved as a simple minor investor; I have been involved as a partner who is raising a substantial part of the capitalization; I have been involved as a producing partner and taken part in the creative process from the beginning; I have been involved as a producer when I've been brought in later on. It depends on the situation, who the players are, the relationships.\n\nThat, of course, is a crazy business because there is no subscription. We're dependent on journalists for reviews. I've been involved in shows that are still running, and I've been involved in shows that closed a month or two weeks after they opened.\n\nI was involved in Sting's \"The Last Ship,\" and it's gone. That show was a $15 million to $16 million capitalization, the lead producer was an old friend — he had produced \"Rent\" and \"Avenue Q\" — but it didn't work. They lost everything. Fortunately, I was not the lead producer on it, just an investor.\n\nQ: What was the first Broadway show you invested in?\n\nA: My favorite show as I started getting involved in the business was \"A Chorus Line,\" which opened in 1975. I went with a few people from the Ice Capades to see the show — JoJo Starbuck and a couple of her friends.\n\nFast-forward to 1990, when it was closing on Broadway. I'm watching \"The Phil Donohue Show\" one morning, and they had the original cast members on. I picked up the phone and I called an agent friend of mine. I said, \"Susan, we need to take this show back out on the road.\" She told me we'd never get the rights to it. We ended up getting the rights to it, though, and I was the lead producer along with Bob Young.\n\nAt the time, Visa was doing commercials where you could buy certain things only if you had Visa. They found out we were going back out on the road with the longest-running show in Broadway history, and they became our sponsor. They spent millions on showing a TV commercial that said you could only get it on Visa.\n\nWe went out on tour for two years, it was a great success and I got spoiled. Then someone came up with the idea to put Robert Goulet in \"The Fantasticks,\" so I went along for that. It was a disaster!\n\nQ: How do you think Broadway shows have changed over the past 35 years? It seems that there are trends toward more popular music and jukebox shows.\n\nA: With the cost of producing going up — a musical now is $15 million by accident — and the risk that comes with that, finding the right source material so that you can minimize your risk so that you will have something that people will recognize is clearly a norm now. A lot of producers have joint ventures with the movie studios — Universal, Fox, Dreamworks — and they have a bank of titles. There are new works to explore, like \"Groundhog Day\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nThere are clearly not as original musicals as they used to be. A lot of it has to do with the risk that's attached to it. You want something that's going to have recognition and create demand. Disney has a portfolio of titles and they've successfully rolled them out.\n\nThe other thing that's happened on Broadway, more so with plays because they don't have to commit as long, is screen actors committing to the stage. This past year, you had Larry David, Bradley Cooper, John Lithgow, Glenn Close, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Hugh Jackman, James Earl Jones and Helen Mirren all in plays for limited runs. That's another kind of familiarity and name recognition.\n\nQ: In order to keep track of all these different moving parts in your business, what is your workday like?\n\nA: I'm not one of those people who wants to micromanage. I have great people, and I'll only jump in when I need to. I can't manage every date and I can't be everywhere.\n\nAt this stage in my life, I want to do what I enjoy doing, and I really enjoy the producing and investing side of the business, and the new shows. I also like to be involved in our larger markets in Buffalo and Rochester.\n\nQ: We as a society are becoming more insular. Others in local entertainment often say that they're not competing with each other but with getting people off their couches and out the door — that's really the struggle. Why do you think it's important to have those communal entertainment experiences?\n\nA: The single biggest challenge we face in our industry is developing new audiences. You see what the film industry has done, producing many movies that are tailored to those younger audiences to get them to go. We have tried to do that. The difference is that when you create a big hit like \"The Book of Mormon\" that really triggers that audience, it's $150 a ticket, when a movie is $15 — or you can wait a little while and see it at home.\n\nWe as an industry have tried to build shows for newer and younger audiences, but the reality is that they are not the ticket-buyers. Our ticket-buyers are 45-plus. That's not good, but it's been a problem for a very long time.\n\nWhat we try to do is to find balance and get family shows in, so that parents bring their kids. If we can get the kids to have an experience at a \"Cinderella\" or an \"Annie\" or a \"Lion King\" or a \"Wicked\" before they're looking at their mobile devices.\n\nFamily shows are the hottest thing on the road right now. You look at the weekly grosses nationwide, and family shows are on top, because parents want to get their kids out and experiencing live theater, instead of sitting together in a restaurant and everyone's on their phones. You can't use your phone in the theater.\n\nIn all of our cities, we try hard to create programs where we can get young people involved. When we did \"Phantom of the Opera\" in Rochester, we did a program called \"Behind the Mask\" for middle-school kids about coming out from behind the mask and being who you are. They did this whole education program and then came out to see the show. When we had \"Memphis,\" we worked with inner-city schools and told them about the show and how this African-American woman fell in love with a white DJ, based on a true story in Memphis. He brought black music to the mainstream, but he went to a black club and they didn't accept him. We taught them the story, we bought them Dinosaur Bar-B-Q before the show, and we put them in the balcony. They rocked the house!\n\nIf we give them that experience when they're young, we may not get them again for 10 years — but we'll get them back in the theater.\n\nQ: What do you think the arts adds to cities like Binghamton and Elmira?\n\nA: One of the things I try to remind everyone is the economic impact that the arts can have in the community. Many years ago, \"Cats\" was having a celebration on Broadway as the longest-running show. Mayor Rudy Giuliani was speaking, and he said, \"I'm reminded by the people in the theater industry that if you take the Knicks and the Nets, the Giants and the Jets, the Yanks and the Mets, the Islanders and the Rangers, and you add up all their attendance, more people see a Broadway show in New York City every year.\"\n\nIf you go around the country and take all the arts, and you looked at how that compares, it's a similar equation. The difference is this: When you go to an arts event, where do you spend your money? On the streets. You eat in the restaurants and you park in the lots. When you go to a sporting event — and I'm a huge sports fan — where do you spend your money? At the venue.\n\nThe arts can be an economic engine, particularly for the heart of an urban core if that's where your theater is located. It's also one of the top five assets that corporations look for when coming to a community.\n\nQ: You're a Tony Award voter and you'll be at the ceremony. You're also making sure to see all the shows that are nominated. Who do you think will win?\n\nA: For best play, \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" is probably the frontrunner, and that's the one I'll vote for.\n\nThe musical categories are interesting. \"An American in Paris,\" \"Something Rotten\" and \"Fun Home\" are three very, very different musicals, more so than I've seen in many, many years.\n\n\"American in Paris\" is adapted from the movie, and it's a physically magnificent show, glorious production, and the dancing is unbelievable. The choreographer is a ballet choreographer. It's a classic story with a big dance number at the end of the first act — a beautiful show.\n\n\"Something Rotten\" is an original musical — clever, smart, entertaining and fun.\n\n\"Fun Home\" is a touching, sensitive, beautiful piece of theater — provocative, sad, and with a beautiful score. It's not a spectacle.\n\nSo they're very different. My problem is that I have a small involvement in all three of them. I haven't decided what I'm voting for, and I was at opening night of all three. I will wait until the last minute and have to make a decision. If I had to guess, I'd say \"An American in Paris\" will win — it feels like it right now, but a lot can happen before the awards are handed out.\n\nFollow Chris Kocher on Twitter: @RealChrisKocher.\n\nAlbert Nocciolino\n\n• Age: 63\n\n• Title: President of NAC Entertainment\n\n• Job: Presenter of regional Broadway shows; Broadway producer\n\n• Born in: Binghamton\n\n• Lives in: Binghamton\n\n• Education: The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/things-to-do/2019/10/25/disney-lion-king-louisville-broadway-tickets-dates/3993146002/", "title": "The Lion King on Broadway heads to Louisville: Tickets, dates", "text": "WHAT: PNC Broadway in Louisville presents \"Disney's The Lion King\"\n\nWHERE: The Kentucky Center for Performing Arts, 501 W.

It reaches so many generations, it's absolutely amazing.\"\n\nLouisville shows 2019:Your ultimate fall arts guide to Broadway, ballet and theater\n\nFrom the original animated film that debuted in 1994 to the 1997 Broadway musical performance, “The Lion King” remains one of the highest-grossing and longest-running shows in history. In its 20-plus years on Broadway, the show has grossed $1.4 billion on Broadway and $7 billion worldwide, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThere have been productions in Africa, Asia, Mexico and Europe, most notably in London’s West End, where it has been continuously playing since 1999.\n\nIf it's been a while since you've seen the pop culture phenomenon, we'll help refresh your memory. And if it's the first time you'll be taking your kids to meet Simba, Scar, Nala, Pumbaa and the rest of \"The Lion King\" gang, Hooper and Sanders have some professional pointers on that topic, too.\n\nHere are five things to know before you see PNC Broadway in Louisville's production of Disney's \"The Lion King\":\n\nHow long is the show in Louisville?\n\nWith its bright colors, catchy tunes, elaborate costumes and lovable, and not so lovable, characters, \"The Lion King\" returns to Louisville to wow crowds for a fourth tour Oct. 30 to Nov. 17 at the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts, 501 W. Main St.\n\nRelated:Broadway fans, Louisville has a powerhouse lineup coming for 2019-20\n\nIt is an 'everybody' show, but there are limits\n\nHooper, a father of two, plays Zazu in \"The Lion King.\" A no-nonsense, uptight adviser to the king, Zazu is a red-billed hornbill who serves Mufasa, Scar and Simba —the royal family.\n\nAs the stage adaptation continues its 20-year run, it's easy to assume the characters would get stale, but in fact, says Hooper, the opposite is true.\n\n\"I was encouraged to bring my own ideas to the character and I've been told my Zazu has a very 'Bob Fosse' feel to him,\" he told The Courier Journal. \"It's a lot of fun to create the role as my own.\"\n\nWhile Hooper would love for his own kids to see his \"Bob Fosse\" interpretation of the bossy hornbill at the Kentucky Center, he knows they are still too young.\n\n\"The show is recommended for ages 6 and older,\" he said. \"There is a lot going on onstage that can hold a child's attention but it's also two and half hours long and that'd be tough for any young child, even if their dad is playing the amazing Zazu.\"\n\nIt has an uplifting message\n\n\"The Lion King\" is the tale of a regal young lion prince named Simba who overcomes adversity and accepts responsibility for his pride and land to become king of the jungle.\n\nHis adventures include encounters with hyenas (Shenzi, Banzai and Ed), birds (Zazu), a gassy warthog (Pumbaa), meerkat (Timon), a baboon who doubles as a shaman (Rafiki), an evil lion (Scar) and several others.\n\nThe lesson learned by the end of the story is simple — “Oh yes, the past can hurt,” Rafiki tells Simba. “But you can either run from it or you can learn from it.”\n\nIf you are taking older kids, there is enough action to keep them entertained. The same goes for adults. For younger kids, there is some doom and gloom but it's offset by humor, friendship and romance.\n\nIf romance is still an icky word in your preteen's world, Hakuna Matata, no worries. Remember, there is no kissing in the animal kingdom — although an adorable cub does appear at the conclusion of \"The Lion King.\"\n\nSee also:Louisville and Lexington dancers are uniting for exclusive dance series\n\nIt features award-winning music\n\nThe music of \"The Lion King\" is upbeat and fun so be ready for at least a couple of the songs to get stuck in your head.

After 20 years, \"The Lion King\" continues to be a feast for the eyes and for that matter, your ears and heart.\n\nWhile there are many twists and turns on the way to the final curtain, the overall message is overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\"It's one of the timeless stories that reaches so many different people in so many different seasons of life,\" Sanders said. \"It's a beautiful story and I am proud to be part of it.\"\n\nCheck out:After 99 years, Caufield's still serving up Halloween scares\n\nReach Kirby Adams at kadams@courier-journal.com or Twitter @kirbylouisville.

It's also known for being very, very expensive.\n\nSometimes, tickets can cost hundreds of dollars. In December 2017, \"Hamilton\" set a record for the highest premium ticket prices. According to Variety, the premium tickets sold for $849 per seat.\n\nBut you don't have to break the bank to sit in a Broadway seat. If you do a little digging, it's not hard to find affordable tickets for $50 or less.\n\nTheater opens minds and holds up a mirror to society. There's no reason you need to pay an arm and a leg to experience that.\n\nMore:Drama at Cider Mill Playhouse: Why the curtain fell on a Southern Tier institution\n\nMore:Here's your complete guide to theater in upstate New York\n\nHere's a cheat sheet on how to purchase tickets on the cheap.\n\n1. Go the day of for rush, lottery and standing-room-only tickets\n\nSometimes the cheapest tickets can be purchased the morning of a show. They're a good option if you're not picky about seating and don't have your heart set on a certain production, but have a handful of shows you would like to see.\n\nSome shows have all three options: rush, lottery and standing room only. Others just have one or two of the choices.\n\nAll show websites list rules, policies and websites for these special offers. The theater news site Playbill.com also has a handy guide to each Broadway production's rush, lottery and standing-room-only policies.\n\nHere's what each term means.\n\nGeneral rush\n\nShows like the stage adaptation of the hit movie \"Anastasia,\" 2018 Tony Award Best Musical winner \"The Band's Visit,\" brand new musical \"The Prom\" and jukebox musical \"Beautiful: The Carole King Musical\" all have general rush policies.\n\nThis means that a limited number of tickets are sold at the box office for a cheap price on a first-come, first-served basis. General rush tickets must be picked up in person, so simply go to the box office and ask if they have any rush tickets available. Typically, box offices limit rush tickets to two per person. Seating locations are determined by the box office staff.\n\nRush ticket prices vary with each show, but they typically hover around $40. \"The Band's Visit,\" \"The Prom\" and \"Beautiful: The Carole King Musical's\" rush tickets sell for $40, while rush tickets for \"Anastasia\" are $42.\n\nSince there's a limited number of them, rush tickets usually sell quickly. Some fans line up for rush tickets hours before the box office opens, depending on the show's popularity, so it never hurts to be early.\n\nIn-person lottery\n\nWhile they are becoming less popular, some shows have in-person lotteries. This means hopefuls can take their chances and enter their names in a lottery about two hours before a show begins. Names are drawn outside the theater an hour or so before curtain.\n\nThere are a limited number of lottery tickets, and winners are limited to two tickets per person. Entrants must be present at the time the names are drawn in order to qualify for a ticket. Seating locations are determined by the box office staff. Some seats may be partial-view seats, meaning your sight may be blocked or in an angle that does not have a full view of the stage.\n\n\"Wicked,\" which recently celebrated its 15th anniversary, sells $30 tickets during its in-person lottery.\n\nDigital lottery\n\nDue to safety concerns as well as convenience, most Broadway musicals and plays have opted for digital lotteries. It's the same concept as the in-person lottery, but entrants can enter online and don't have to be present to win.\n\nLike the in-person lottery, seats are also determined by box office staff and may be partial view seats. Check each production's website for instructions on how to enter their digital lottery. The downside to digital lotteries is, since it takes much less effort than going to a box office, the odds of scoring a ticket are much lower. But it's worth a try.\n\nThe Disney hit \"Aladdin\" sells $30 tickets through a digital lottery. Entrants for \"Aladdin's\" lottery must be 18 years or older. \"Anastasia\" also has a digital lottery with tickets priced the same as its general rush: $42.\n\nThe famed #HAM4HAM lottery was previously an in-person lottery, offering audience members a chance to score $10 tickets for the wildly popular musical \"Hamilton.\" But after the lottery drew monstrous crowds, the show switched to a digital lottery available through the \"Hamilton\" app.\n\nStanding room only\n\nSome shows — typically hit shows that are hard to get into — have standing-room-only (SRO) policies. These tickets are served on a first-come, first-serve basis when the show is sold out.\n\nPurchasers of standing-room-only tickets must stand in the back of the orchestra section to watch the show.\n\n\"The Book of Mormon,\" the smash musical by \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, offers $27 standing-room-only tickets when the show is sold out. They're available two hours before each performance. Broadway's longest-running musical, \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" sells $27 standing-room-only tickets if a show is sold out.\n\n2. Download the TodayTix App\n\nThere are plenty of secondary ticket sellers (be careful of scammers), but TodayTix offers tickets on the cheap. Some shows also use the app as a vendor for their digital lotteries.\n\nJust download the app from the app store and peruse its deals on shows. Tickets can be purchased right in the app. It also stores your credit-card information, so there is no need to re-enter while making additional purchases.\n\nOn Jan. 8, TodayTix offered $58 tickets to the Disney hit \"Frozen,\" $55 to Cyndi Lauper's \"Kinky Boots\" and $49 tickets to the hit Irish drama \"The Ferryman.\"\n\nTypically, you do not see your seat location until you arrive in the theater. Purchased tickets are either picked up at the box office or outside the theater from one of the company's concierges.\n\nOutside of Broadway, TodayTix also sells tickets for select off-Broadway and regional shows. The app launched in December 2013. It's also available in London, Chicago, Philadelphia and other metropolitan areas.\n\n3. Go right to the box office\n\nSometimes, there are certain tickets you can purchase in person at the box offices that you can't purchase online.\n\nFor example, if accessible seats are not sold the day of the performance, some shows sell them to people who may not require them (those without wheelchairs or other needs).\n\nPartial-vision seats are sometimes also sold in person after rush seats are sold. It doesn't hurt to pop into a theater the day of the show and ask the box-office staff what tickets they may have to offer.\n\n4. Walk the red steps at TKTS\n\nHave you ever seen the red steps in Times Square? Did you take a picture on them?\n\nWell, they have another purpose besides being a cool selfie backdrop.\n\nThe TKTS Discount Ticket booths are located beneath the steps. In addition to the flagship location in Times Square, satellite booths are also located at the South Street Seaport and Lincoln Center.\n\nDiscounted tickets are sold the same day of the performance, but full-price tickets also can be purchased to future shows.\n\nTKTS tickets are sold daily, with a limit of six tickets per person. While tickets must be purchased in person, visit tdf.org or download the TKTS app for a live list of available shows and discounts. The live list of prices gives both the flat price and percent discounted.\n\nThe $5-per-ticket service fee goes towards the Theater Development Fund, a nonprofit organization that supports programs that bring theater to a wide variety of audiences.\n\nOn Jan 4, TKTS offered $46-87 tickets to the Tony Award winning \"The Band's Visit\" and $88 to \"The Cher Show,\" chronicling the life of the legendary diva.\n\nCheck out tdf.org for hours and more information. Make sure you purchase tickets from behind the counter and not from sellers on the street. They may be scams or illegally obtained.\n\n5. Watch out for specials and contests\n\nBroadway shows often offer specials and discounts throughout the year.\n\nTwice a year, Broadway shows collaborate for NYC Broadway Week, where 2-for-1 tickets are sold in mid-January and early September.\n\nVisit nycgo.com/broadway-week for more information.\n\nFor younger audiences, there's Kids' Night on Broadway. During Kids' Night on Broadway, audience members ages 18 and under can see a participating Broadway show for free when accompanied by a full-paying adult. A select number of shows participate and offer talk-backs, activity books and other events.\n\nFor dates and more information, visit kidsnightonbroadway.com.\n\nIndividual Broadway shows also hold their own promotions and special discounted ticket nights. Just recently, \"Hamilton\" gave fans a chance to enter a lottery for a chance to score $10 tickets for the Halloween showing of the musical. Unlike the daily lotteries, every single seat was available for a $10 ticket.\n\n6. Are you a student or young professional? Take advantage of that\n\nSeveral shows and production companies offer discounted tickets to students and young adults.\n\nLincoln Center Theater, where a lavish revival of \"My Fair Lady\" is currently playing, offers LincTix for young adults ages 21-35. The program is free to join and gives members access to $32 tickets for the center's theatrical productions. Members also have access to post-show parties and events.\n\nThe Roundabout Theater Company, where a revival of \"Kiss Me Kate\" will play in the spring, offers HipTix for theatergoers ages 18-35. HipTix members can purchase $25 tickets to all of Roundabout's Broadway and Off-Broadway shows.\n\nThe Roundabout also offers a 40 percent discount to military personnel and their spouses. A student rush offers half-price tickets a half-hour before curtain with a valid student ID.\n\nCheck each production's website for similar programs.\n\n7. Monitor box-office popularity\n\nAt the end of the day, shows just want to sell tickets. When they don't sell enough tickets, they close.\n\nSo, shows that aren't selling well will make it a little easier for their audience members.\n\nTheater news sites like Broadway.com and Playbill.com rank shows based on their box-office numbers. The shows toward the bottom of the list are most likely to have rush tickets and other discounts. Try for those shows for the best luck.\n\nSince the shows at the top of the list aren't hurting for sales (\"Wicked\" is frequently at the top), they are least likely to discount their tickets.\n\nFollow Maggie Gilroy on Twitter @MaggieGilroy.

When the opportunity arose to move to London for a production of “West Side Story,” she grabbed it.\n\n“I snuck away from classes one afternoon for auditions,” recalled Watson. “By the time I got back to my apartment I was offered a part.”\n\nWhile her role was only the understudy for the leading lady, the experience was invaluable.\n\n“To be in London for eight or nine months was wonderful,” she said. “I fell in love, got married and returned to the U.S. I was later divorced and remarried (for over five decades now to TV producer Norton Wright), but my career was taking off. I got a call from Gower Champion who offered me the role of Kim MacAfee in the Broadway production of ‘Bye Bye Birdie’ which opened in 1960.”\n\nWhen casting calls were made for the 1963 movie version, Watson traveled to LA for an audition.\n\n“I lost out to Ann-Margaret, but that’s the way it goes,” she said. “I stayed in Hollywood for a while and appeared on TV shows like ‘Dobie Gillis.’”\n\nShe also had a chance to work with a larger-than-life Hollywood star.\n\n“I did a sitcom pilot for a show called ‘Maggie Brown’ with Ethel Merman and I was to play her daughter. Ethel was a take charge person, I can tell you, and didn’t need any instruction from the director. She staged the opening song, “Mutual Admiration Society,” that we sang together, and knowing I was a dancer suggested I should do a few kicks during the routine. We were both disappointed when the show wasn’t picked up.”\n\nSusan went on to appear in over half a dozen more Broadway shows.\n\n“My first leading role on Broadway occurred when Anna Maria Alberghetti left the musical ‘Carnival’ for the national touring company,” she recalled. “Gower Champion asked me to replace Anna Maria as ‘Lili’ for the rest of the Broadway run, so I found myself on stage nightly with Jerry Orbach who played the role of the puppeteer. Jerry had been in the show from its very beginning and in the scene where the puppeteer slaps Lili, he'd gotten into the habit of smacking Lili very hard because he felt it helped bring tears to Anna Maria’s eyes.\n\n“In my case, being hit hard by six-foot Jerry Orbach not only brought tears, but outright ire! After the first couple of nights of being so battered I asked Jerry to stop, but he was into realism and kept swinging – until one night I’d just had enough and slapped him back. The look on Jerry’s face was real surprise, but he took it much easier slapping me for the rest of the run! Years later, when he was starring as that tough detective in the ‘Law & Order’ TV series, I ran into Jerry in New York and he remembered the night of our fisticuffs and joked that I'd hit him so hard that night in ‘Carnival’ that I’d loosened one of his teeth. I didn’t believe him – but was happy that he remembered.”\n\nThroughout her career, Watson also appeared in numerous off-Broadway plays, as well as in summer stock and other popular productions across the country such as “My Fair Lady” and “The Sound of Music.”\n\n“I particularly liked returning to my hometown of Tulsa in the late 1980’s to play the role of Maria in ‘The Sound of Music’ where Theo Bikel co-starred in the role of Captain von Trapp. Just before the curtain on our opening night, he came to my dressing room carrying an ad for the show in the local Tulsa newspaper in which my name was in giant print and his name in such small print that it was almost illegible. He kidded me, saying ‘I’ve heard of the hometown girl making good, but this is ridiculous!’ It makes for good chemistry to have a leading man with a sense of humor.”\n\nBack on Broadway in the early 70s, Watson played Nanette in “No, No, Nanette” which featured 1930s film star Ruby Keeler, returning to the stage in her 60s, having retired from acting in the 1940s.\n\n“She was a great hoofer, and we revered her,” Watson recalled. “She was very famous and sometimes you don’t feel comfortable trying to get close to someone like that, but she was always a dear to us. In fact, throughout my career, I’ve been lucky to mostly work with nice people who made me feel comfortable.”\n\nWatson’s last Broadway performance was in 2011, at the age of 73, in “Follies.”\n\n“We opened at the Kennedy Center in D.C., and I remember my 9-year-old grandson in the audience yelling out ‘That’s my Grandma!” laughed Watson. “But it was a thrill to be back on stage with other veteran woman performers like Elaine Paige, Linda Lavin, and Bernadette Peters.”\n\nWatson is also proud of her recent CD not only because it contains classic songs from legends such Stephen Sondheim, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin, but because it features works by veteran women songwriters including Phyllis Molinary, Gretchen Cryer, Michele Brourman, Amanda McBroom, and Marilyn Bergman.\n\n“These women have had long, successful careers,” says Watson. “I hope that CD’s production and content symbolizes that active, empowered, senior women are a resource that America can be proud of.”\n\nNick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Ala., and has written features, columns, and interviews for over 600 magazines and newspapers.

That child is recognizable, but so very different.\n\nAnais Mitchell's folk opera updating the Orpheus myth began with separate incarnations in her home state of Vermont in 2006 and 2007. She followed those stage performances with her critically acclaimed 2010 “Hadestown” recording that included Ani DiFranco, Greg Brown and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.\n\nNow Mitchell is in New York, where “Hadestown” marked its official opening night off-Broadway on Monday at the celebrated New York Theatre Workshop, a company that has won a Pulitzer and 17 Tony Awards. That’s the same company that in January was staging the musical “Lazarus” featuring new music by David Bowie when the pop legend died at age 69.\n\nMitchell, the singer-songwriter who grew up in Addison County, has spent the past three years immersing herself in “Hadestown” more deeply than ever. A decade after she created the show, Mitchell remains fascinated by “Hadestown.”\n\n“Part of it is just for the staying power of the mythology and how it continues to reveal new things,” she said last week from her current home in Brooklyn. The theme of dreamers and poets and the “idealism of making art in a world that is not always responsive to that,” Mitchell said, provided the initial seed for “Hadestown” as the Iraq War wore on during George W. Bush’s second presidential term.\n\nThe musical’s Woody Guthrie-esque feel of Depression-era struggle resonated when the world financial crisis hit in 2008. Increased focus on climate change taps into the natural-world-vs.-industrial-world vibe of the story. Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on America’s southern border and make Mexico pay for it brings the “Hadestown” song “Why We Build the Wall” into the realm of current events.\n\n“I didn’t expect to have new feelings about that song,” Mitchell said.\n\nAnother part of the freshness of “Hadestown” for Mitchell is that the production is much different than the one Vermonters saw 10 years ago and even from the more recent album. The album had 20 songs; the off-Broadway version of “Hadestown” has 35, doubling the show's length to two hours and helping to define the story more clearly.\n\n“There’s been a really healthy push and pull between poetry and clarity,” Rachel Chavkin, the award-winning off-Broadway director leading the new version of “Hadestown,” said last week on the set of the production. “It can feel at times like different masters.”\n\nMichael Chorney, the Vermont guitarist involved with “Hadestown” since day one in 2006, said Vermonters who are familiar with the original “Hadestown” will find that the new version resembles the old ones.\n\n“It totally does, yet it’s completely altered,” Chorney, who originally arranged the music for “Hadestown” and plays guitar in the new show, said over lunch last week in New York. The work has been altered, he said, to give the new production “a little broader appeal” and more directly spell out the story.\n\n“That has been addressed — boom! — completely,” he said.\n\nA piece of poetry\n\nMitchell put in grueling 12-hour days helping Chavkin and the New York Theatre Workshop crew get “Hadestown” ready for opening night. That’s in addition to Mitchell’s role as a wife, and as a mother to 2 ½-year-old Ramona, whose 5 a.m. wake-up time doesn’t mesh with her mother’s often late nights at work.\n\nIt has been a “really exhilarating and unsustainable schedule,” Mitchell said. “It’s not a family friendly schedule in show biz.”\n\nIf she suffers, though, she suffers for her art. Mitchell said her interest in bringing “Hadestown” to New York developed over time.\n\nA couple of years after the “Hadestown” album came out, Mitchell began searching for someone to help bring her creation to New York. She reached out to Chavkin after seeing her 2012 operatic musical “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,” which earned the director one of her two Obie Awards, the off-Broadway equivalent of the Tony Awards. (An updated version of that show starring Josh Groban moves to Broadway this fall.)\n\nChavkin said she hadn’t heard “Hadestown” until Mitchell contacted her. “I listened addictively to the album,” Chavkin said. “The music is so glorious.”\n\nAfter she “essentially memorized” the album, Chavkin said she began discussing with Mitchell where she thought there were holes in the story line. That’s how the 15 additional songs developed, in part through workshops held in New York and across the country to figure out what was working and what needed adjustment.\n\n“It was sort of geological in terms of the pace of it,” Chavkin said of the development of the new production. “One of the first things Anais said to me is, ‘This is a poetry piece, not a prose piece.’” That meant the production needed to hew to the artistic language and feel of “Hadestown” while aiming for a wider audience.\n\n“You want that space,” Chavkin said. “You want the songs to be able to do their job as pieces of poetry” and not holding the audience’s hand too tightly.\n\nMitchell said she’s been happy to cede some creative control, as she has watched the artists at work on this production introduce their own changes. “That’s been really inspiring,” she said, calling the New York Theatre Workshop both nurturing and experimental.\n\nSimilarly, Chorney has eagerly stepped aside as music director to just play guitar. “There were so many cooks in the kitchen” with the New York Theatre Workshop production, according to Chorney, “that I said, ‘I’ll just come as the guitar player,’ and that was a great choice.”\n\nStill, he said, working on this version of “Hadestown” has been challenging, including six-hour band rehearsals. The production opened in previews May 6, and changes were made constantly to “Hadestown” right up until last Friday’s production — changes that musicians and actors alike had to adjust to immediately.\n\n“It’s really been intense,” said Chorney, who has worked with Mitchell since the Lincoln musician produced her 2004 album “Hymns for the Exiled.”\n\nThat intensity seems to be paying off. “Hadestown” has long been sold out for much of its original run that was scheduled to end June 12, so now that run has been extended into July. That early buzz bodes well for continued success for “Hadestown,” but Mitchell said she wasn’t ready to acknowledge the production was successful until after opening night.\n\nMitchell, a touring singer-songwriter, already is thinking ahead after the play’s planned closing on July 3. “Part of me feels like I don’t know what comes next,” she said. “I look forward to checking back into the music world.” She’s also ready to return to her non-professional life.\n\n“I certainly look forward to focusing on something else,” Mitchell said, “even if it’s just my daughter, or maybe cooking something.”\n\nStill, she can’t help but dream of a future for “Hadestown.” That future could include a Broadway production, a “Hadestown” tour or a film — as she put it, “all the fantasies.”\n\nDarkness and light\n\nThe new production, as seen at Friday’s preview, taps into the brooding visual tone Mitchell and fellow Vermonter Ben t. Matchstick originally set. (Matchstick is listed by the New York Theatre Workshop as the co-conceiver of “Hadestown.”) Almost immediately, though, the off-Broadway production that Chavkin moves along deftly lets viewers know that this “Hadestown” will be bigger, brighter and much more specific about where the story is and where it’s headed.\n\nThe character of Hermes (played by Chris Sullivan) goes from ancillary in previous versions to essential in this one. He’s an affable if rough-hewn narrator with a Springsteen-ish soulful rasp in his voice who leads the audience through the deep twists and turns as “Hadestown” retells the Orpheus myth. “There was a railroad line on the road to hell,” Hermes sings as he introduces the characters and the story.\n\nNew spoken lines illuminate the romance between Orpheus (Damon Daunno) and Eurydice (Nabiyah Be). As they get ready to marry, she sees his songs as impractical for a young couple trying to make it in a harsh world; Orpheus thinks songs are exactly what a harsh world needs. Eurydice makes beautiful music of her own, as in a new song that makes clear why she is such a strong, pragmatic woman (“All I’ve ever known is how to hold my own/But now I want to hold you, too”).\n\nIn her search for security, Eurydice is drawn to work in a bleak factory setting known as Hadestown that’s led by the intimating Hades (Patrick Page). His wife, Persephone (Amber Gray), tries to loosen his grip and consider just maybe letting this beautiful young love flourish. A trio of singing fates (Lulu Fall, Jessie Shelton and Waitsfield native Shaina Taub) serve in part as the characters’ audible consciences.\n\nThe most notable absence from this take on “Hadestown” is Mitchell herself, with Be taking over Mitchell’s role as Eurydice. Be’s voice is throatier than Mitchell’s, but she captures much of the “Hadestown” creator’s expressiveness.\n\nDaunno has a similar high-end voice to Vernon, the Bon Iver leader who filled the role of Orpheus on the “Hadestown” album. The song “Wait for Me,” so achingly gorgeous on the album, remains touching but takes on an undercurrent of anger through Daunno’s more aggressive approach.\n\nGray makes her Persephone fun and flirtatious but also wise and wily. Page, like half of the cast a Broadway veteran, seems born to play the Prince of Darkness. His Hades wears a tailored suit and sunglasses and sings in a voice that sounds like fire. When the first act draws to a close with his dramatic, growling “Why We Build the Wall,” it becomes clear that Eurydice and Orpheus have a reached a point of no return.\n\nThe band led by music director and pianist Liam Robinson includes Chorney on prepared guitar that brings melody and tension to “Hadestown” with its unexpected plucks and twirls. The tight seven-member group includes stand-up bass player Robinson Morse, Chorney’s fellow Vermonter who performed in the very first production of “Hadestown” in Vermont a decade ago.\n\nThe scenery by Rachel Hauck builds upon the post-apocalyptic feel Matchstick conveyed in earlier performances of “Hadestown,” utilizing the venue’s brick walls and iron work to bring out the bleak factory-life feel of Hades’ confined community. A leafless, spiraling tree extends over the stage toward an audience that sits in-the-round not in typical theater seats but in second-hand-store wooden chairs that add to the production’s intimacy.\n\nAt its core, “Hadestown” remains built upon the songs of Mitchell, so probing in their exploration of art and love and how that all fits into a world built on power and money. Mitchell’s music was at the production’s heart from the start a decade ago. Now that heart has more flesh to surround it.\n\nThis story was first posted online on May 24, 2016.

And I admit to shedding a tear or two last weekend during a farewell tour of the building.\n\nI don’t usually get emotional over the closing of buildings, especially one as non-descript, drab and leaky as the Players.\n\nBut whatever it lacked in design, it made up for through the vibrance and variety of the people and shows it featured. Like a cherished family home, it is filled with memories. Its backstage walls are decorated with painted logos of past shows and the signatures of those who were involved in them. Many are names that sent me back 30 years or more.\n\nFor a few performances, I helped turn pages for a musical director, and I even helped paint the dressing room. (I sure hope they have been repainted since then.)\n\nThe Players of Sarasota, as it will always be known to long-time residents despite its name change four years ago, is closing a door on the past by moving out of the building it has called home since 1974. The property was sold two years ago and will probably be turned into one more condominium tower on the busy stretch of U.S. 41 near the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall.\n\nThe Players is trying to raise the money it needs – somewhere around $30 million – to build a new three-theater complex in the Waterside development in Lakewood Ranch. Groundbreaking is still a few years away.\n\nIn the meantime, while shows can’t be staged because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Players board decided to stop renting the aging building and move to smaller quarters where they can maintain offices and possibly present performances when it is safe.\n\nBefore coronavirus, Managing Artistic Director Jeffery Kin had planned a final show next April to celebrate the company’s first 90 years before moving. That show, “A Few of Our Favorite Things,” will now be presented virtually and streamed online at 7:30 p.m. Friday. It will feature video recorded songs from the past, testimonials and a few surprises. Tickets are $20. (941-365-2494; theplayers.org)\n\nAs a warm up for the show, the theater has been selling off many of the old costumes, props and furnishings it won't keep to raise some funds. Some actors have discovered costumes they wore years ago.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the staff also conducted a series of sold-out “So Long Dearie” tours, which gave a limited number of volunteer actors and crew members, and a few longtime fans, a chance to say goodbye to a place where they spent so much time entertaining audiences.\n\nI shared a tour with some cast members from “Head Over Heels,” which turned out to be the final show before coronavirus shut the theater in March. Their exuberance and joy at being reunited and seeing little things they may have taken for granted backstage or in the lobby, was exciting to share.\n\nI thought back to my first night at the Players in 1985 when I was assigned to review the play “Light up the Sky.” I was working as an assistant city editor at the newspaper, hoping to some day become a theater critic. I had moved just a few months earlier from Washington, D.C., where the community theaters I had been to operated in recreation centers or church basements. They didn’t have dedicated theater buildings, sort-of cushioned seats and real sets and lighting. They also didn’t have the kind of talent I would discover over the years was plentiful here. I would come to know many of them personally, mostly from my seat in the audience.\n\nStepping past the stage area and the costume shop, I stared for a moment at the office where Peter Strader ran the theater during his long tenure as artistic director. He used to regale me with stories about theater history during our frequent interviews. His involvement with the theater stretched back to his childhood, almost to the start of the Players itself. To me, he was the heart and soul of the theater even after he “retired” in 1993.\n\nScanning the painted show posters (which Kin said will be preserved on canvas with photo transfers in the new building), I saw my early years as the newspaper’s theater critic flash by as I read the names of actors long retired or no longer with us, like Sandi Jones, Steve Creduer and Allan Kollar.\n\nI found the name of the late Anya Flesh, a choreographer and director who became one of my dearest friends and a surrogate mother. If theater buildings carry the ghosts of those who came before, I’d want hers hanging around in whatever is built on the site.\n\nI was reminded of shows I had forgotten but now saw playing out once again on that stage.\n\nI watched countless performers make their Sarasota debuts at the Players and then gain confidence with each subsequent production. Sharon Murphy comes to mind. She represents one of the joys I’ve had in reviewing community theater, where you can frequently discover previously unknown talent and watch it blossom. Sharon first appeared looking stiff and nervous as she sang beautifully in an old operetta. Before she moved from the area many years later, she had become the theater’s leading lady of the time, able to play almost any role.\n\nThis was the place I first saw Teresa Stanley, who exploded onto the stage as a nervous young teenager in a production of “Purlie” staged by Nate Jacobs. Now she’s a Broadway veteran helping young artists learn the craft. I remember the first time I saw Steve Dawson, one of many people who found love at the theater. He met his future wife, Dianne, in “A Little Night Music.”\n\nThe tour provided the visitors a chance to take one last bow on the stage. I felt awkward and undeserving, but I thrilled watching Caitlyn and Jason Ellis and Tahlia Chinault take theirs.\n\nBefore the staff members took the stage and sang “What I Did for Love,” we were reminded several times that a theater company is far more than a building. It is a family and a home for creativity, opportunity, friendship, provocation and entertainment. The Players doesn't die or fade away when they turn out the lights next month, and those who found something to enjoy there will take the memories with them.\n\nI wish the Players had already raised the money and were moving to a newly finished building. I worry that the virus and the challenges every community theater faces in fundraising will make it difficult for the project to be completed.\n\nBut recalling the vibrancy on stage in that winter production of “Head Over Heels” and hearing the enthusiasm in the words of Kin, board chair Donna DeFant and the staff members, I will hope for the best that this quiet ending is really just a beginning waiting to happen somewhere else.\n\nContact Jay Handelman at jay.handelman@heraldtribune.com.

This year, judges chose DeAngelo’s musical from among 240 submissions from all corners of the world.\n\nGetting selected, though, brought a whole new set of challenges — a whirlwind cycle of funding, casting, rehearsing and revisions. A couple of producers already have expressed interest in “Foolerie.”\n\nFor DeAngelo, the pressure is on to get it right.\n\nAn evening’s work\n\nA few blocks from Broadway, at the corner of 8th Avenue and West 36th Street, the cast of “Foolerie” — or most of them, anyway — assemble at Pearl Studios for an evening rehearsal on the Wednesday before Independence Day. A pizza shop and a nail salon do business at street level, but 12 stories above, 12 rehearsal spaces are abuzz with all manner of creative endeavors, from music and dance to yoga and casting auditions.\n\nRental of the small, beige, windowless room dubbed Studio J comes with certain sensible rules: Don’t leave trash behind, keep the hallways quiet and put the piano back where you find it. The air this Wednesday is humid and temperatures hover in the mid-80s, but the industrial-sized fan in the room can’t be running or no one will be able to hear each other.\n\nOne cast member grins as he turns down a knob near the door labeled as controlling the air conditioning, though it’s unclear as minutes stretch into hours whether it actually helps alleviate the heat.\n\nOpening night for “Foolerie” is exactly three weeks away.\n\nDeAngelo — who wrote the music, lyrics and book for the show — is still penning new songs and tinkering with plot points. He and director Tralen Doler must make sure their actors are properly prepared in the limited time they all have together.\n\n“As the playwright, my job is to fight for ambiguity, and my director’s job is to fight for clarity,” DeAngelo said in an interview earlier that day. “We’re in this diametrically opposed struggle where together, we make a work of art.”\n\nIn excited, rapid-fire sentences — the sign of a sharp mind revving at full throttle — he can make his elevator pitch for the show as “Mel Brooks does William Shakespeare,” with an Elizabethan troupe of jesters blending British theater styles such as vaudeville, music hall, commedia dell’arte, pantomime and mummery to tell cleverly twisted versions of the Bard’s best works.\n\nThe stakes, however, are deadly serious: The Clowne (Ian Knauer) and his protege, the Knave (Ryan Breslin), are competing to determine whether audiences prefer cheap laughs or something with more substance and real emotions. The loser of that contest faces execution. Things start getting a little fuzzy, though, when the fools’ reality starts overlapping with the characters they play.\n\nDuring rehearsals, the set, costumes and props haven’t been finished, so the world of “Foolerie” is created strictly in the actors’ imaginations, with guidance from DeAngelo and Doler. Chairs with Post-It notes bearing labels such as “stump” are scattered around the room as stand-ins for set pieces.\n\nIn a run-through of the Act 1 finale, the fools sprinkle each other with “love dust” and head gleefully into the Forest of Arden to wed. DeAngelo and stage manager Kelly Ruth Cole take turns standing in for the absent Knauer, a last-minute casting after the original choice for the Clowne had to bow out due to a family emergency. (Knauer is in Northport, Long Island, that night, in the middle of a seven-week run of “The Producers”; he will not join the cast in rehearsals until Friday.)\n\n“That’s what it means to be loved and to be married? This whole marriage thing sounds great!” Miller (Chandler Reeves) says.\n\n“We should!” Breslin replies as the Knave. “Love is the greatest of all feelings — everyone deserves it.”\n\nAll the characters start jumping around with excitement. Lecherous old Hospital John (Patrick Richwood) looks close to tears as he exclaims: “I’m finally getting married, Mama! I’m finally getting married!”\n\nThe tune begins, and burly country boy Camber (Geoff Belliston) sings: “You think I’m getting married? What a farcical notion, I’m sorry, but no!” Until he gets his own dose of the magical dust and quickly changes his mind — then he grabs nearby fool Sommers (Ian Fairlee) in a bear hug and lifts him off the ground.\n\nAlong the wall, DeAngelo nods his head in time with the music, sometimes mouthing the words of his songs along with the actors, watching his creation come to life in front of his eyes.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nFiguring out how Santino DeAngelo ended up in theater begins with his parents and the DNA they passed down to their son.\n\nBoth are major players in the Greater Binghamton arts community: His father, Jan, has worked as an actor, accompanist, composer, choreographer and music director in numerous local productions; his mother, Shannon, has starred in many regional musicals and danced on NYC stages. Together, they run the local Performer’s Studio, which offers a full range of performance training.\n\nAs Jan DeAngelo Productions, they also have mounted a number of their own musicals, particularly those by Rodgers & Hammerstein and Jerry Herman. The oldest of four siblings (with sister Marianna and brothers Giordano and Luciano), Santino recalls performing in “The Music Man” at age 6, and he thinks this early influence helps to explain why his writing style feels more like a throwback to an older generation of songsmiths compared to his contemporaries.\n\n“Even when I was young, I definitely knew I wanted to be an artist,” he said. “I wrote my first musical when I was in high school [at Seton Catholic Central] and we performed it — it was not great, but I knew that this was the key.”\n\nIn 2007, at age 16, DeAngelo began his professional career by composing a small suite for the Golf Channel/PGA Tour titled “A Stroll Down the Fairway.” Two years later, he received his first commission from the Binghamton Community Orchestra to compose the “Fantasy Overture to the Trojan War.”\n\nWhile earning his degree at BU in classical civilization, myth and performance (a program he created himself with the help of faculty advisers), he composed a trilogy based on Ovid’s “Metamorphosis,” including a ballet, a musical work for piano and cello, and an ancient Roman pantomime — the last of which he performed himself and was recorded for future broadcast on WSKG. He also wrote and staged a ballet version of “Pygmalion.”\n\nAs the capstone of a violence prevention and community outreach project in 2011, DeAngelo and fellow local playwright Marty Murray created and staged a new translation of Federico Garcia Lorca’s “Blood Wedding.” He’s also directed short plays at KNOW Theatre in Binghamton and worked as an artistic associate at the Cider Mill Playhouse in Endicott.\n\nFor about three years, he worked alongside Broadway producer Robert Eckert, a Binghamton native and retired newspaper executive living in Florida who had backed shows such as “Memphis” and “First Date: The Musical.” They worked together on DeAngelo’s musical version of Washington Irving’s “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” — until they saw another theater try to mount its own version and fail.\n\nThat meant going back to the drawing board in the summer of 2012. Eckert laid down some restrictions to save costs: The source material had to be free, and DeAngelo had to write the whole thing himself.\n\nThey decided that a lighter subject matter was needed, DeAngelo said: “We thought, ‘Well, we’ve been writing a dark show for eight months — let’s do a comedy!’”\n\nThe idea to mine Shakespeare for inspiration stemmed from DeAngelo’s fascination with the history of theater and how it has evolved since the late 16th century. Underpinning that concept, though, is a subtle social critique about making commercial art in the 21st century. Does it have to be mindless laughs, or can there actually be substance to it, something that makes you think?\n\nAs the show evolved, one primary concern has been the difference between colloquialisms and anachronisms. The characters speak not in blank verse or rhymed couplets, but as people on the street talk today. However, DeAngelo does not go for cheap laughs by having the jesters refer to modern pop culture that they’d know nothing about in the late 1500s.\n\n“What we’re doing in ‘Foolerie’ is letting the audience enjoy things in the same way a 16th century audience would enjoy them,” he said. “A lot of the jokes are not mine but Shakespeare’s jokes, and a lot of the classic cross-dressing stupidity is right out of Shakespeare — so when you laugh at it as the audience, there’s something in me that says: ‘Yes, this is it! We’re laughing at the same jokes!’”\n\nAn early version of the musical, called “It Happened One Midsummer Night,” consisted of four scenes and three songs performed in Eckert’s Florida living room. A full first act was workshopped at StarStruck Theatre in Stuart, Fla., in mid-2013, while the completed show — now titled “Another Happy Ending” — received a second workshop there that October.\n\nAs Eckert and DeAngelo prepared the show for the next step, Eckert died in January 2014 at age 93. DeAngelo used the last of Eckert’s seed money to produce a final workshop for “Another Happy Ending” last June at the Goodwill Theatre’s Schorr Family Firehouse Stage in Johnson City. Major rewrites cut the cast size in half and reset the story as a showdown between two fools — an older, more jaded one against his younger, more idealistic counterpart.\n\nWithout a producer to back him, though, DeAngelo was unsure where to go next.\n\nOff to the Big Apple\n\nOn a whim, he submitted the musical — retitled again as “Foolerie” — to the New York Musical Theatre Festival late last year.\n\nNYMF co-founder Jen Bender, serving her first year as its director of programming, has a big-picture perspective that shapes what audiences get to see. For 2015, that includes 22 full musicals, 13 special events and concerts, 11 readings and six educational programs from July 7-27 at various venues around Manhattan.\n\nAbout 40 judges blind-read all the submissions, making their recommendations for the best ones to stage without regard to who wrote them.\n\n“One of the exciting things about my job is that I’m one of the only people who knows from January until June what the shows are,” she said in an interview between NYMF rehearsals. “I’m generally the only person — plus maybe my intern — who has actually read or heard all of the shows.”\n\nBender believes that a variety of settings, storylines and cast sizes keeps the festival strong. Common themes that judges see include Greek mythology (a royalty-free goldmine of material) and New York City coming-of-age tales thinly veiled from the writer’s own life.\n\n“Foolerie” stood out from this year’s competition for its humor, unusual setting and mature writing style. In fact, it’s one of 10 shows in NYMF’s Next Link Project, which receive an extra boost through subsidized slots in the festival as well as dramaturgical support and increased networking opportunities.\n\n“His lyrics are far and away leagues above the lyric-writing that I see and hear, both at NYMF and in the theater community,” Bender said. “He has a real ear for rhyme and wit — there’s a difference between being funny and being witty, and he understands that in a way that would make Cole Porter and [Stephen] Sondheim proud.”\n\nAs a judge who read DeAngelo’s musical, Doler loved “Foolerie,” too, and determined that he wanted to direct it. The duo formed a quick bond, and together they recruited a solid team behind the scenes, including costume designer Whitney Locher (fresh from Roundabout Theatre Company’s “Into The Woods”), scenic designer Jennifer Price-Fick (whose other new work can be seen in the new musical “Amazing Grace,” also opening this month) and musical director Benet Braun (“The Fig Leaves are Falling”).\n\nWith help from NYMF’s resident casting director, Michael Cassara, DeAngelo and Doler also assembled the right actors for the roles. Breslin, who plays the Knave, originated the role of Race in “Newsies” and later performed in “The Book of Mormon.” He recently filmed dance sequences with Channing Tatum for the upcoming Coen Brothers comedy “Hail, Caesar!”\n\n“There was something about Ryan’s energy that I specifically wanted — and I watched a ton of videos,” DeAngelo said. “I’ve seen videos of Ryan performing that he doesn’t even know are online!”\n\nBreslin, for his part, relished the idea of a brand-new role to put his stamp on: “The experience with ‘Newsies’ was great because it was something I got to originate, so getting to have free rein over something like this is fun. Also, I read the script and had no idea what to expect.”\n\nKnauer’s onstage experience spans both sides of the Atlantic: He appeared on Broadway in “Mamma Mia!” and “By Jeeves” as well as on London’s West End in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.” His resumé also includes a couple of turns as villains in that oh-so-English stage tradition, pantomime. (As an American, he had no clue that Brits boo the baddies as soon as they appear from stage left.)\n\nDespite “The Producers” running five days a week (sometimes with two performances per day), Knauer expressed confidence that he’ll be ready for his role as Elizabethan England’s most infamous fool.\n\n“It’s a matter of headspace,” he said. “I have to be very specific with what amount of time I need to devote to ‘Foolerie’ in order to memorize it and really make sure I’m getting all of that information, and now the other show is such that I don’t have to do much preparation — I just go and do it.”\n\nRichwood, who plays Hospital John, may be a familiar face because of memorable roles in films such as “Pretty Woman,” “The Princess Diaries” and “Armageddon,” as well as two years playing the White Rabbit in the Disney live-action series “Alice in Wonderland.” Over his 35-year career, he’s also appeared in plays and musicals in New York City, Los Angeles and across the country.\n\n“They cast you because they like what you’ve got in your box of toys,” Richwood said of the process. “They want you to use them — they don’t want you to leave them outside the [rehearsal] room, which is smart. You get a bunch of people with a bunch of different toys and you throw them onto the floor — then you have some great possibilities.”\n\nRounding out the rest of the cast are Reeves as Miller, Belliston as Camber, Fairlee (who appeared in last summer’s reading in Johnson City) as Sommers, Olivia Polci (granddaughter of Four Seasons rock legend Frankie Valli) as Oates, Patrick Massey as Leanard and Diego Diaz (a cast member in “Ring of Fire” at Chenango River Theatre in Greene last summer) as the Mute, who plays violin and mandolin while four other band members accompany him offstage.\n\n“I have to find this character’s voice without using the voice, and that’s a completely different category of communication,” Diaz said in the hall as his castmates practiced a few songs. “Half of that will be emoting through music.”\n\nRevisions and fundraising\n\nNearly every show accepted to NYMF undergoes a certain amount of changes. Actors, directors and people behind the scenes may suggest tweaks to make a musical flow better onstage. A song or two might be added or dropped, perhaps rethought or rewritten. A dramaturge or festival organizer like Bender could see a critical flaw that the musical’s writers did not.\n\nEveryone involved in “Foolerie,” though, agrees that DeAngelo’s musical has undergone more extensive revisions than most — which is unexpected considering the high marks it received from judges to get into the festival in the first place.\n\nOne revision tried to address the problem of underwritten female characters by making the actors all male, as performing troupes were in the Elizabethan era, but Doler and Bender urged against that change and sent DeAngelo back to the drawing board. Price-Fick’s suggestion to set the contest outside inspired another version, and flipping the fools’ reaction to marriage in the Forest of Arden from elated to confused meant composing a completely different opening number for Act 2.\n\n“Some writers are very rigid: ‘I’ve spent a lot of time developing this material and it’s very important to me.’ I’m not like that,” DeAngelo said. “If we’re going to spend all this money having these wonderful actors, we should use their experience to learn and grow the show.”\n\nAlthough he is deeply involved in the production as the director, Doler feels as though he can sometimes step back for a more objective view of “Foolerie” — what’s working, what’s not and how to make it better.\n\n“Santino is seeing all of the layers, because he’s written all of them,” he said. “I’m able to say, ‘OK, but if I’m in the audience, I don’t get all that — so unless all of that is clear onstage, we need to fix it.’ That’s something we’ve really been working on.”\n\nAs late as last week, DeAngelo continued to pull all-nighters to get the final pieces of “Foolerie” fitted into place. Meanwhile, he also had to raise the $65,000 needed to pay for the show’s six performances — an effort that started in April with a fundraiser cabaret at the Schorr stage in Johnson City featuring songs and behind-the-scenes stories about the musical.\n\n“NYFM has been wonderful. I cannot say enough good things about this opportunity for young writers. It’s very important, and we’re thankful for it,” DeAngelo said.\n\n“However, the onus was on us to raise the funds. The cool thing is that the time I spent with Robert Eckert in Florida running his office perfectly prepared me to become a producer in my own right. He gave me the skills — even though I didn’t realize it at the time — to be able to put a show together.”\n\nFreedom to play\n\nBack in the rehearsal room three weeks before opening, the actors sit in a semicircle of folding chairs around the piano, binders of “Foolerie” sheet music propped on music stands in front of them. As Braun plays the tunes and helps cast members smooth out harmonies, voices are raised in enthusiastic song.\n\nDeAngelo hovers nearby to explain changes to lyrics and offer guidance. When the right moment arrives, he gets a gleam in his eye and asks with dramatic flair: “Shall we sing the dirtiest song ever written?”\n\nEveryone bursts out laughing, because they know exactly which one he means: a waltz-time ditty called “Lechery,” sung by Richwood’s Hospital John about his appreciation for the fairer sex — the younger the better. (No, we aren’t sharing any lyrics here.)\n\nThe moment puts Richwood solidly in the spotlight, and even from his seat, he clearly relishes each innuendo and naughty turn of phrase.\n\n“I have the added benefit that I’m getting older, and people are more aware of what I bring,” he says later. “I’ve been doing it long enough that people are aware that ‘oh, that guy’s gonna be funny.’ So they’re giving me some elbow room to play — and I like that. It’s nice! They don’t have to — it’s totally out of their generosity.”\n\nIndeed, the mood among cast members — most of whom are learning their roles amid other jobs and creative endeavors — is a joyous one, because they know they have a hand in molding what audiences ultimately see.\n\n“I feel very free. We can make really bold choices, and we can see what works and doesn’t work,” says Reeves, whose once-stuttering Miller gains new confidence with help from the Knave. “Tralen’s been really great about us finding that together. We’re playing a troupe, but we’re also kind of a troupe ourselves.”\n\nAs gypsies who move frequently from project to project, actors are trained to jump into roles and trust their co-stars — but “Foolerie” has a rehearsal period about half as long as a normal Broadway show, and building those connections had to happen quickly. Luckily, it did.\n\n“Everybody’s gotten very comfortable with each other very fast. That was my main concern,” Breslin said. “All these people have to be ridiculous, to let go of all their inhibitions and just be clowns onstage.”\n\nAs in Shakespeare’s time, a few audience members will be seated onstage, and actors may pull them into the play’s narrative to portray, say, rough seas during an ocean voyage. “Foolerie” is clearly a scripted musical, but the jesters’ contest at times resembles an improv show — never more so than when random elements are part of the mix.\n\nFor Knauer, everything adds up to create the theater magic for actors and audiences alike: “When you’re working on a musical, it’s an incredibly collaborative art. It’s not about one person, ever. Even when you’re seeing just one person on stage, if they have music, of course there are musicians. There’s lighting, there’s sound, and the costumes that that person is wearing. Add a troupe of people who never leave the stage, and no matter what you’re doing, you have to make sure everyone is on board.”\n\nThe future of ‘Foolerie’\n\nWhen “Foolerie” opens Wednesday night, the long journey from conception to knocking on Broadway's door will be almost exactly three years.\n\nA few last-minute hurdles remain. The cast and crew won’t even get onto the actual stage at the Pearl Theatre Company’s off-Broadway performance space on West 42nd Street until early Wednesday, when they’ll do five or six hours of tech rehearsal, take a few hours’ break and then return for showtime. (To take the pressure off, no critics or potential investors will be in the audience that night.)\n\nAnticipation has been high, and ticket sales are brisk — the Wednesday, Friday and early Sunday shows have already sold out, and a second show has been added later on Sunday afternoon. There’s a buzz about “Foolerie” that makes it stand out among the other NYMF offerings this year.\n\nThe big question looms large, though: What comes next?\n\nTheater can be a fickle business, especially when so much money is at stake. For the sake of comparison, “The Book of Mormon” — with only seven roles — required about $9 million to mount on Broadway in 2011, and it’s safe to presume that costs have only gone up since then.\n\nDeAngelo says at least a couple of producers have shown interest in “Foolerie” — perhaps one of them will take a gamble on it, bankrolling a less expensive off-Broadway run to test the waters or funding productions in Los Angeles, Chicago or elsewhere before returning it to the mecca of musicals in New York City. Or someone could love it enough to send it straight to Broadway, fulfilling DeAngelo’s dreams before he hits 25.\n\nAlternately, nothing could happen — at least not immediately. “Foolerie” might have a good run as part of NYMF, but the right person may not be in the right place at the right time to take the show to the next level. Maybe it’s still not quite perfect and requires more tinkering. Someone might admire DeAngelo’s style but hire him to create something entirely different.\n\nWhatever happens, DeAngelo is hardly standing still. Last year, he won recognition from New Musicals Inc.’s New Voices Project, which is supported in part by Walt Disney Imagineering — so he remains on Disney’s radar as a potential future writer. Starting this fall, he’ll pursue a master’s degree in playwriting at Columbia University.\n\nNo matter the future, he’ll remain forever grateful for Binghamton’s pivotal role in getting him to this point — from the family and teachers who encouraged him to the busloads of supporters heading to New York City to see the show.\n\n“Rod Serling always felt that if you couldn’t love your hometown, you can’t love anywhere else. I feel the exact same way,” DeAngelo said. “The more time I spend away from Binghamton, the more I miss it and the more I realize how uniquely special our community is. Everyone is like family.”\n\nFollow Chris Kocher on Twitter @RealChrisKocher.\n\nIf You Go\n\n•What: “Foolerie” at the New York Musical Theatre Festival\n\n•When: 9 p.m. Saturday, July 25; 4 p.m. Sunday, July 26, and Monday, July 27.

Kim Reynolds' sweeping education bill, but senators amended it significantly Wednesday night before approving it 34-16 in a party-line vote.\n\nAttacked by opponents who argue it endangers transgender children, the legislation has been championed by Republicans who say it will give parents more oversight and control over what their children learn and do in school.\n\nSen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Pella, said the bill establishes guidelines for schools that are \"reasonable and fair.\"\n\nIn his closing comments Wednesday before the vote, Rozenboom referenced a Facebook post of a local school board member that he disagreed with. The post said that public education is meant to teach kids what the community needs them to know, not what parents want them to know.\n\n\"In fact, it’s my belief that this bill matches up with what most schools are doing right now, and what most parents already expect their school to be doing,\" Rozenboom said. \"But as long as I’m in this chamber, I will work to rein in those schools that believe the purpose of public education is to teach our children what they think society needs them to know. We must put parents back in charge of their children’s education.\"\n\nThe House has passed similar bills to remove books with sex acts and prohibit instruction on LGBTQ subjects in elementary schools. But the House and Senate will need to reach a compromise on the various bills before they can send some to Reynolds to be signed into law.\n\nMore:Gender-affirming care ban for kids, trans bathroom bill are now Iowa law. What they do:\n\nNew 'age-appropriate' definition would prohibit books with sex acts\n\nThe bill instructs school districts to create a library program for kindergarten through 12th grade that includes only \"age-appropriate\" materials.\n\nThe bill redefines \"age-appropriate\" to state explicitly that it may not include any materials with descriptions or visual depictions of a sex act. Iowa Code defines sex acts as a list of sexual activities between two or more people, including penetrative or oral sex or sexual touching.\n\nSchools would need to remove any library books that include descriptions of these sex acts, if the bill becomes law.\n\n\"We think those books just need to go away from the library at school,\" Rozenboom told the Des Moines Register. \"That's not book banning any more than Hollywood bans movies when they have a rating system.\"\n\nDescriptions of sex acts would still be allowed for human growth and development classes for students in seventh grade and above.\n\nDemocrats said the bill would require school libraries to remove essential books, like the Bible or the Diary of Anne Frank, that include discussion of sexuality.\n\n\"This isn't really about sex, it's about discrimination and censorship,\" said Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City.\n\nThe age-appropriate rule replaces the governor's original proposal to create a statewide list of books that had been successfully challenged in another district. Students in other districts would need parental consent to check out those books.\n\nRozenboom said relying on a statewide list would be \"cumbersome.\"\n\n\"I'd rather the schools just got rid of the books that are so explicit,\" he said.\n\nMore:Iowa Poll: Majority oppose requiring parental consent for books banned in other schools\n\nNo gender ID, sexual orientation through sixth grade\n\nThe bill prohibits any instruction or classroom materials about gender identity or sexual orientation from kindergarten through sixth grade.\n\nRozenboom said discussion of gender identity is \"totally unnecessary\" for elementary school children.\n\n“Parents and guardians that wish to have that conversation with their child can do so in the home, or any other setting they would like,\" he said. \"But to have that in the public school, most of, many of us, believe is inappropriate.”\n\nThe bill also removes any discussion of human sexuality through grade six. Instead, students in first through sixth grade would receive human growth and development instruction about self-esteem, stress management, interpersonal relationships and domestic abuse.\n\nSen. Liz Bennett, who is the first openly LGBTQ woman to serve in the Iowa Legislature, said the bill erases LGBTQ Iowans. She raised concerns that schools couldn't address bullying of transgender or gay students, and LGBTQ teachers would be unable to discuss their personal lives or identity.\n\n\"It sends the message to kids of LGBTQ couples, or kids who are LGBTQ themselves, that there is something so wrong with them that a teacher can't even discuss or acknowledge their family,\" Bennett, D-Cedar Rapids, said.\n\nBill requires parental notification for transgender student\n\nThe bill also includes a requirement that school employees immediately notify parents if they believe a student has expressed a gender identity that does not match the child's sex at birth.\n\nSchools would require written parental consent to use a name or pronouns for the child that differs from the name or pronouns listed in the district's record.\n\nIowa Republicans have considered various versions of this proposal this year, but none have passed into law.\n\nSupporters of the proposal say it's necessary to loop in parents on major life changes that their child may be going through.\n\n\"The intent of the bill is to inform involved parents in such significant matters as gender identity and their welfare,\" Rozenboom said. \"That's the intent of the bill, keep the parents involved with their child.\"\n\nMore:Iowans would face public assistance restrictions under bill passed by Senate. The impact:\n\nOpponents say the bill encourages school employees to speculate about the gender identity of students. Democrats also brought up concerns that a transgender child may not feel safe coming out to their family.\n\nThe bill requires a school employee to report directly to the Department of Health and Human Services if they believe a child is transgender and would not be able to safely come out to their parents.\n\nParents given 'ultimate responsibility' over decisions for child\n\nThe bill adds a new section to Iowa Code to codify parents' rights to make decisions for their children.\n\nIowa law would say that parents have the \"fundamental, constitutionally protected right\" to make decisions for their child under the age of 18, including their medical care, moral and religious upbringing, residence, education and extracurricular. Any restriction of those rights would be subject to the highest legal standards.\n\nHowever, the legislation makes an exception for Iowa's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, which Reynolds signed into law Wednesday.\n\n\"This amendment gives every other family and every other child in this state the right that we will not interfere in their medical decisions, except our transgender youth and their families,\" said Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport.\n\nThe bill also specifies that parental rights do not allow parents to neglect or abuse children, and that child welfare officials, law enforcement and courts may still make child welfare decisions.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

The board oversees municipal services in Disney's theme park properties and was instrumental in the company's decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s.\n\nThe rule change was first reported by the Orlando Sentinel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/07/ohio-house-bill-616-bill-sexual-orientation-education-gender-dont-say-gay/9482593002/", "title": "What's in Ohio HB 616: The bill on sexual orientation education", "text": "Ohio is making national headlines for its introduction of a bill that mirrors a controversial Florida law restricting how schools talk about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nSupporters call these \"Parental Rights in Education\" laws while opponents have named them the \"Don't Say Gay\" bills.\n\nWhat would Ohio's bill do?\n\nHouse Bill 616 would ban both instruction and materials about sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade in all public and most private schools.\n\nStudents in grades four and higher could discuss these issues, but \"any curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity\" would be \"age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\"\n\nTeachers who violated these rules could lose their licenses and schools could lose their state funding.\n\nThe Republican legislation also restricts teacher discussion and training on other \"divisive or inherently racist concepts\" such as critical race theory, diversity, equity, and inclusion learning outcomes and \"any other concept that the state board of education defines as divisive or inherently racist.\"\n\nHow is HB 616 similar to the Florida law?\n\nThe language on sexual orientation and gender identity is strikingly similar.\n\nFlorida's law says \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3.\"\n\nIn Ohio, HB 616 says schools shall not \"teach, use, or provide any curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity\" in \"grades kindergarten through three.\"\n\n'Divisive issues' in education:Compare Ohio House Bill 616 to Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' law\n\nHow is HB 616 different?\n\nThe penalties under the Florida law and the Ohio bill are different. Florida allows parents to sue the teacher and/or school district who violated its law while Ohio would send them to the State Board of Education.\n\nThe Florida law also limits how students can receive health services such as counseling and what parents must be told when children use them. That's not in Ohio's bill.\n\nOn the flip side, HB 616 has language restricting the teaching of other divisive concepts such as race.\n\nWhere is Ohio's bill in the legislative process?\n\nHB 616 was introduced in early April in the Ohio House by state Reps. Mike Loychik, R-Bazetta, and Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland.\n\n“Children deserve a quality education that is fair, unbiased and age appropriate,” Loychik said in a statement. “This legislation promotes free and fair discussion.”\n\nThe bill has yet to be assigned to a committee.\n\nNo companion legislation has been introduced in the Ohio Senate.\n\n“The classroom is a place that seeks answers for our children without political activism,” Schmidt said in a statement.\n\nWhy is it called the 'Don't Say Gay' bill?\n\nThese bills use terms such as sexual orientation and gender identity, but critics have nicknamed them “Don’t Say Gay” laws.\n\n\"It becomes clear very quickly when the specific materials begin to be cited that when they say sexual orientation they mean non-heterosexual orientations,\" Equality Ohio Policy Director Maria Bruno said.\n\nThat's why books about princesses marrying princes don't get flagged as inappropriate for children, but stories about different kinds of families do.\n\n\"We know they are trying to avoid having to explicitly say we want to reject LGBTQ identities, but they are doing everything they can to substantively make that happen,\" Bruno said.\n\nSchool librarians across the country recently told The Washington Post they're fighting against pre-emptive removals of LGBTQ books.\n\nAnd teachers in Florida who oppose their new law have started circulating memos about only using they/them pronouns because he/she implies a gender identity.\n\n\"Our identities are not divisive concepts,\" Bruno said. \"The implications from bills like this is that merely being a member of the LGBTQ community is, in itself, a perversion.\"\n\nWill HB 616 replace the other divisive concept bills?\n\nOhio lawmakers have already spent dozens of hours debating how educators talk about racism, slavery and inequity during hearings for House Bills 322 and 327.\n\nBoth bills would restrict how K-12 schools teach about divisive concepts, but HB 327 goes farther. It would limit how these subjects could be discussed by public colleges and other public entities like municipal governments and libraries.\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau.

Opponents say it stigmatizes LGBTQ students, teachers, and the broader community.\n\nEarlier this week, North Carolina Senate Republicans revealed the Parents’ Bill of Rights, which has brought a new level of attention to how K-12 public schools approach instruction and identity. The legislation has already cleared a pair of Senate committees as it moves toward a chamber vote.\n\nSo, what’s in the bill? Might it pass? And why is it being proposed now? Here are five things to know about the controversial Parents’ Bill of Rights:\n\nIs it a 'Don't Say Gay' bill?\n\nPerhaps the bill’s most contentious paragraph addresses how sexual orientation and gender identity are taught in early grades. The latest edition of the bill states:\n\n\"Instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity shall not be included in the curriculum provided in grades kindergarten through third grade, regardless of whether the information is provided by school personnel or third parties.”\n\nThis language is similar to what Florida included in its Parental Rights in Education bill, which opponents labelled the “Don’t Say Gay” law.\n\n“We really see (the North Carolina bill) as another “Don’t Say Gay” bill,” said Craig White, who works as the supportive schools coordinator at the Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality. “There’s some parents’ rights at the front (of the bill) to mask it,” but if you look at what those rights are, it’s things like the right to receive a report card or the right to join a parent-teacher organization which are well-established common practices.”\n\nWhite believes the bill’s “vague” language will “create a chilling effect on teachers and students,” thereby depriving young students of an accurate and healthy representation of the real world.\n\nSenate Republicans disagreed, arguing the ban on sexual orientation and gender identity instruction would still permit references to LGBTQ people and relationships.\n\n“This is about not teaching 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-year-olds things that are not age appropriate,\" said Sen. Michael Lee, a New Hanover County Republican and a Senate education committee co-chairman.\n\nSharing pronouns and more\n\nCritics of the bill fear it would force schools to divulge information to parents that students wouldn’t want their parents to know. One specific example is what materials they check out from school libraries. Another is a student’s pronouns. The bill states parents must be made aware before any changes are made to K-12 public school students’ names or pronouns.\n\n“LGBTQ students tend to come out first in environments where they feel safest, and usually that is at home,” White said. “For students who feel unsafe sharing that information with their family, they may rightly recognize that they are at risk of abuse or being kicked out of the home if that information was to be shared.”\n\nThe bill also requires school districts to inform parents of any “changes in services or monitoring related to his or her child's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,” which same say is too vague and puts students in abusive families in danger.\n\nRepublican leaders argue informing parents of these changes should be a basic right.\n\n“There’s somehow an expectation that a medical provider at a school, whether it be a nurse or a doctor or a counselor or even a teacher, in the limited time they spend with the child, are somehow in a position to decide what is best for that child,” said Sen. Ralph Hise (R-McDowell), during the Senate Healthcare Committee hearing Thursday.\n\n“What treatment they should receive and the issues they're dealing with and ultimately make a determination about the home of a child being insufficient and therefore their choice for those treatments should stand without informed consent.”\n\nHandling curriculum concerns\n\nNorth Carolina parents can currently object to any school materials, but the parental bill would require schools setup more detailed procedures on how to respond to each formal curriculum complaint and inquiry.\n\nPublic schools units, including districts and charter schools, would be expected to resolve parental concerns within seven days. If the issue isn’t resolved within 30 days, the public-school unit is required to provide a statement explaining why.\n\nIf the schools fail to do this, parents can take their objection to the State Board of Education, which will set up a hearing with the school unit covering the costs.\n\n“I think it's just an attempt to provide a little more detail to a process that can vary from one district to another, and with differing levels of inquiry,” said Terry Stoops, director of education studies at the Raleigh-based conservative John Locke Foundation think tank, which provided State Republicans with a legislative outline that inspired the bill.\n\n“I think a lot of parents feel challenges they are bringing to school administrators and school board members have not been met with satisfactory responses.”\n\nCritics are concerned these requirements unfairly ask already time-burdened public school administrators to handle a potentially inordinate number of curriculum from parents peeved over issues like perceived left-leaning bias in history lessons, LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum, Critical Race Theory, and more.\n\nEducation news:NC schools defy tourism industry and state over summer break law\n\nWhy a parents' bill now?\n\nThe parental bill of rights in North Carolina isn’t unique. At least 19 other states have introduced limits on LGBTQ classroom instruction through recent bills highlighting parents’ rights to know what is being taught at public schools.\n\nDuring the virtual lessons held amid the COVID-19 pandemic, parents “got an up-close look at what their children were being taught. It opened their eyes in a lot of ways,” Senate leader Phil Berger said during a press conference introducing the bill.\n\nSince then, school reopenings, student masks, critical race theory, book bans, and LGTBQ-inclusive curriculums have all been at the forefront of school board meetings, and school board races. This year saw a record number of school board candidates in North Carolina, and political scientists say the GOP is accentuating school issues to win higher offices.\n\n“I think the political wedge issues of critical race theory, book bans, and LGBTQ inclusion have been driven by Republican Party politics that emphasizes a couple of dynamics that benefits the party as a whole, especially in terms of critical energy for voter turnout,” said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College.\n\n“One prominent dynamic is the notion of “in-group” versus “out-group”, with the in-group being White, typically straight and older voters who see their hold on political power slipping.”\n\nWhat are the chances it passes?\n\nAnd early indication is that the Democratic Governor isn’t a fan. After the bill was unveiled, Cooper released the following statement:\n\n\"Schools are grateful for involved parents and we need even more of them working together with teachers to educate our children. However, the last thing our state needs is another Republican political ploy like the bathroom bill which hurt our people and cost us jobs, so let's keep the \"Don't Say Gay\" culture wars out of North Carolina classrooms.”\n\nRepublican’s don’t possess the supermajority needed in the General Assembly to override a Cooper veto. To get the Parents’ Bill of Rights passed over Cooper’s objection, a handful of Democratic House and Senate members would need to cross party lines to support it.\n\nWinning over Democrats is possible, especially if the bill is modified said Terry Stoops adding, \"I think this is an opportunity for Cooper to establish common ground with Republicans.\"\n\nYet whether or not the bill becomes law, opponents say it’s already brought irrevocable damage to the classroom.\n\n“My colleagues and I talk about legislation like this as harassment legislation,” White said. “It helps create a hostile educational environment for students in K-12 schools.”\n\nReporting from the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nBrian Gordon is a statewide reporter with the USA Today Network in North Carolina.

The wave of activity on the state level comes ahead of a highly anticipated ruling by the US Supreme Court expected later this year that could have major implications for abortion.\n\nNew abortion restrictions\n\nFlorida – Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure into law on April 14 that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The bill allows exemptions in cases where pregnancy poses “serious” health risks or fatal fetal abnormalities are detected if two physicians confirm the diagnoses in writing. What’s next: The American Civil Liberties Union is promising to “take swift legal action” to challenge the law before it goes into effect on July 1.\n\nKentucky – The GOP-controlled state legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of a sweeping abortion bill on April 13 that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, restricts access to medication abortion and makes it more difficult for a minor to obtain an abortion in the state. The legislation does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. What’s next: The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed lawsuits in federal court, arguing the law violates the Constitution.\n\nOklahoma – Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a near-total ban on abortion into law on April 12, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. It would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by up to 10 years in state prison or a $100,000 fine, or both. The legislation would not provide exceptions in cases of rape and incest. What’s next: The law takes effect 90 days after the state legislature adjourns in May.\n\nTennessee – The Republican-led state House passed a bill on Thursday that would allow only physicians to provide drugs used in medication abortions and bar the drugs from being sent via mail. The legislation, House Bill 2416, would establish criminal penalties and civil liability for offenders that would not apply to the patient who was provided the abortion drugs. It would also require physicians to examine patients in person before providing the abortion drugs and to schedule follow-up visits for the patients. What’s next: The bill now heads to the state Senate, where Republican lawmakers also have a majority.\n\nWest Virginia – The GOP-controlled state House passed a bill on February 15 banning abortion after 15 weeks, except in a medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Republican Gov. Jim Justice also signed a bill on March 21 that would ban abortion if a pregnant person is seeking the procedure because the fetus has been diagnosed with or presumed to have a disability. The bill goes into effect in June and provides exceptions in medical emergencies or if the fetus is “nonmedically viable.” What’s next: The 15-week abortion ban bill is now with the state Senate, where its passage would send it to Justice’s desk.\n\nIdaho – Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a bill modeled after the Texas law that bans abortions after embryonic or fetal cardiac activity has been detected, making Idaho the first state to follow the controversial Texas statute that allows private citizens to enforce the restrictions with lawsuits. What’s next: The Idaho Supreme Court on April 8 temporarily blocked the law ahead of its April 22 implementation.\n\nArizona – Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law legislation that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in some cases of medical emergency – becoming the first state this year to enact a ban after 15 weeks, following a similar law Mississippi passed in 2018 that the US Supreme Court seems poised to uphold this year. The bill offers no exceptions for cases of rape and incest.\n\nSouth Dakota – Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on March 23 signed a law that will further restrict access to medication abortions in the state. The law makes South Dakota one of hardest places in the country to get abortion drugs, requiring pregnant women to make at least three trips to a clinic to obtain abortion medication. The measure, however, will not take effect immediately due to litigation. What’s next: The law will not go into effect unless the judge’s injunction is lifted, which Noem’s administration is seeking through an appeal.\n\nNew anti-LGBTQ and trans youth restrictions\n\nAlabama – Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law the state’s own version of Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law on April 8 after the legislature passed a surprise amendment to a transgender bathroom bill. The law will stop K-5 elementary teachers from “instruction” on sexuality and gender. In addition to instructional limits, the bill requires students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that match the sex on their birth certificate. Ivey also signed SB 184 into law, which states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care to minors could face up to 10 years in prison. What’s next: The ACLU, on behalf of two families, has filed a lawsuit in federal court, asking it to strike down SB 184, banning gender-affirming care.\n\nKentucky – The GOP-controlled state legislature has overridden Beshear after he vetoed a bill on April 6 that would prohibit transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public and private schools in the state. The bill, dubbed the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” reads: “An athletic activity or sport designated as ‘girls’ for students in grades six through twelve shall not be open to members of the male sex.”\n\nPennsylvania – The Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted 115-84 on April 12 to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender. House Bill 972, known as the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act,” states that sports or teams sponsored by a public school entity or institution must be designated as male, female or coed and that “athletic or teams or sports designated for females, women or girls…may not be open to students of the male sex.” What’s next: The bill heads to the state Senate, but Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has vowed to veto the legislation.\n\nUtah – The GOP-controlled legislature on March 25 voted to override Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’ veto of a bill that bans young transgender athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams. What’s next: The ACLU has threatened to sue over the law, saying, “Litigation to stop H.B. 11 from taking effect is now both necessary and inevitable.”\n\nFlorida – DeSantis on March 28 signed legislation banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom, approving a controversial measure that opponents have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law. HB 1557, titled the Parental Rights in Education bill, was given final passage by Florida’s GOP-controlled Legislature last month. What’s next: Two LGBTQ rights advocacy groups, as well as students, parents and a teacher in Florida, filed a federal lawsuit in late March challenging the new law and seeking to block its implementation and enforcement. The law is set to take effect in July.\n\nOhio – Two Republican state representatives introduced a bill in the state legislature on Monday that would ban the teaching or providing of “any curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity” to students in kindergarten through third grade, using similar language to the Florida law critics have named “Don’t Say Gay.” If passed, the measure would also forbid Ohio public school educators in grades four through 12 from teaching or using “instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity in any manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” What’s next: Awaiting votes in the state House.\n\nTexas – The state began investigating families seeking gender-affirming care for their transgender minor children after Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton declared such treatment to be “child abuse.” Republican Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Department of Family and Protective Services to begin the investigations. The ACLU sued on behalf of the parents of a transgender girl and an appeals court has upheld a temporary injunction blocking the action. What’s next: Paxton has asked the state Supreme Court to intervene to allow the child abuse investigations.\n\nArizona – Ducey last month signed two bills into law targeting transgender youth in the state, prohibiting trans girls and women from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams and restricting youth access to gender-affirming care. What’s next: The ACLU has vowed to sue to block the law restricting gender-affirming care.\n\nOklahoma – Stitt signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public schools, public charter schools and public colleges in the state.\n\nIowa – Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n\nSouth Dakota – Noem signed a law banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n\nNew anti-critical race theory actions\n\nFlorida – The GOP-controlled state legislature has voted to ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to “feel guilt” for historical events committed by people of their race. The “Stop WOKE Act” would also prohibit instruction that says certain races or sexes are privileged or oppressed. The bill comes after Florida banned the teaching of critical race theory last year in public schools. What’s next: The bill heads to DeSantis, who is expected to sign it.\n\nKentucky – The Republican-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Beshear that restricts classroom instruction about race. The law says in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: “An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex” and that “defining racial disparities solely on the legacy” of slavery “is destructive to the unification of our nation.”\n\nGeorgia – The state legislature approved a bill that would limit discussions about race in classrooms and prohibit schools from advocating “divisive concepts,” including discussion that people “should feel anguish, guilt, or any other form of psychological distress” about their race and that “the United States of America is fundamentally racist.” The bill would also allow the Georgia High School Association to ban transgender students from participating in girls’ sports in public high schools. What’s next: The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for signing.\n\nSouth Dakota – Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order last month restricting the teaching of critical race theory in K-12 schools after the state Senate Education Committee killed a bill that would have accomplished a similar goal. Noem has also signed a law this session blocking mandatory critical race theory trainings and orientations at colleges in the state.\n\nOhio – A bill introduced earlier this month mirroring the Florida law critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” would also ban curriculum for all grades that teaches, promotes or endorses what it calls “divisive or inherently racist concepts.” It would outlaw any textbook, instructional material or academic curriculum that “promotes” concepts such as critical race theory; intersectional theory; The 1619 Project; inherited racial guilt; diversity, equity and inclusion learning outcomes; inherited racial guilt; or “any other concept that the state board of education defines as divisive or inherently racist.” What’s next: The bill awaits a vote in the state House.\n\nNew ‘election police’ forces\n\nFlorida – The Republican-controlled Florida House passed a voting overhaul bill that would create a security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state’s election laws. The legislation would establish a scaled-back version of an elections police force first proposed last year by DeSantis. What’s next: The bill will be sent to DeSantis’ desk for a signature.\n\nGeorgia – State lawmakers passed a bill on their final day of the session earlier this month that would give new election policing powers to the state’s bureau of investigation. Georgia becomes the second state after Florida to pass an election police force bill this year as Republicans continue to falsely claim the 2020 election was rife with voter fraud. What’s next: The bill awaits Kemp’s signature. He has 40 days to sign the legislation or veto it.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jon Passantino"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/05/ohio-republicans-introduce-version-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill/9467432002/", "title": "Ohio GOP proposes HB 616, version of Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill", "text": "A version of the controversial Florida law restricting how teachers talk about sexual orientation and gender identity has been introduced in Ohio.\n\nKnown as a parental rights bill by supporters and the \"Don't Say Gay\" law by opponents, Ohio's House Bill 616 would ban discussion on sexual orientation and gender identity until fourth grade in all public and most private schools.\n\n“The classroom is a place that seeks answers for our children without political activism,” Rep.

Schmidt and Mike Loychik, R-Cortland, sponsored HB 616.\n\nThe two didn't respond to interview requests, but opponents said the two pieces of legislation were \"strikingly similar.\"\n\nFor example, Florida's law states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade three.\"\n\nOhio's bill \"goes into more depth,\" Collins said because it included \"instructional materials.\" She took that to mean potentially removing books with gay characters from elementary school libraries.\n\n\"My interpretation is there can be no books of any kind that deal with any LGBTQ+ issues,'\" Collins said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brigid Kelly called that \"a huge problem.\"\n\n\"We’re not giving people access to the tools, the materials, the lessons they need to prepare children for the diverse world that exists,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Cincinnati Democrat also took issue with requiring grades 4-12 to follow \"state standards\" on sexual orientation lessons when Ohio code doesn't let the state board adopt health education standards.\n\n\"It's definitely confusing,\" she said.\n\nEducators, Democrats slam Ohio bill\n\nKelly and Collins weren't the only Ohioans to take issue with HB 616.\n\nThe two largest lobbying groups for Ohio's educators, the Ohio Education Association and the Ohio Federation of Teachers, oppose the legislation.\n\n\"It’s really going to put both teachers and parents in a really tough spot,\" OEA President Scott DiMauro said.\n\nHe gave the example of a young student with gay parents and asked how a teacher should navigate questions by other children about that student's family. Would a classroom family tree project get a teacher fired, he asked.\n\nSince neither Schmidt nor Loychik responded to requests for interviews, the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau does not know how they would interpret that part of the legislation.\n\nLoychik tweeted that \"curriculum about gender identity and sexuality has no place in K-3 classrooms, period.\"\n\nAnd Center for Christian Virtue President Aaron Baer agreed.\n\nHis organization is still reviewing the specifics of HB 616, but Baer's generally supportive of bringing a Florida-style law to Ohio.\n\n\"The real question is why do people want to sexualize kids at this age,\" Baer said. \"Children need time to develop and grow up and parents should be guiding these discussions.\"\n\nHe doesn't think the bill would block the child of gay parents from creating a family tree. What legislation like this aims to do, in his opinion, is block teachers with \"different ideologies\" from \"pushing\" those beliefs on children.\n\nCynthia Peoples runs a coalition called Honesty for Ohio Education that opposes HB 616 and all of Ohio's divisive concept legislation.

Jeff Taylor, R-Sioux Center, argued that science about gender dysphoria has been \"politicized\" and that lessons affirming transgender experiences are \"about promoting an ideology … that I believe is grounded in something that is not true, is not accurate, and is actually extreme.\"\n\nIowa Republicans have introduced a flurry of controversial bills this session to prevent Iowa schools from accommodating LGBTQ students and teaching about LGBTQ and social justice concepts. Several have advanced this week, bringing them a step closer to the governor signing them into law.\n\nOne bill to require parental consent for students to use a new name or pronouns is poised for debate on the House floor. Other proposals, including a bill to prohibit gender identity instruction through eighth grade, still need to pass through the House or Senate Education Committee.\n\nAt the heart of the issue are transgender youth like Odin.\n\nMore:The inside scoop on Iowa GOP bills targeting sexual orientation, gender identity instruction\n\nConservative parents celebrated the proposals, which they say will refocus classes on academics instead of social issues.\n\nLGBTQ families and advocates argue the measures will make schools even more hostile for the most vulnerable students.\n\nTransgender kids concerned about bullying; conservatives worried about confusion\n\nSenate File 83 would prohibit any curriculum related to gender identity in kindergarten through eighth grade. Supporters of the legislation say it will prevent kids from becoming confused about their gender.\n\n\"Children should not be subjected to gender identity at such a young, impressionable, and confusing age, which I believe should extend from (kindergarten) through 12th,\" said Amber Williams, an Urbandale resident and a leader of the Moms for Liberty group. \"Gender identity is related to feelings and emotions, not science.\"\n\nTransgender kids in those grades say preventing lessons on gender identity would alienate them further. Berry Stevens, a nonbinary 12-year-old who uses they/them pronouns, said they were harassed at school after they came out.\n\n\"One thing that helped me was when my teacher and principal were supportive listeners and took action against these kids,\" said Stevens, crying as they spoke to lawmakers. \"That would be impossible if this bill were passed, and no kid deserves to go through that.\"\n\nTaylor responded that the bill applies only to curriculum, and it would still allow school administrators to act against bullying.\n\n\"Nothing in this bill will prevent children from treating one another kindly,\" he said. \"Nothing in the bill will prevent the punishment for bullying or efforts to prevent bullying in the first place.\"\n\nBut it might force teachers to change those preventative measures, opponents argue.\n\nOdin's mom, Sarah SmallCarter, said Odin's second-grade class had a discussion about pronouns and read a book together about a crayon whose wrapper didn't match its color on the inside.\n\n\"That's all we're asking for, is that you treat our kids in schools with basic human decency and respect,\" SmallCarter said.\n\nParts of the debate veered deeper than education policy, as Taylor and many supporters of the legislation raised questions about why children identify as transgender in the first place.\n\n\"No child in the state of Iowa, in any kind of school, deserves to be bullied or deserves to be treated with anything other than respect,\" Taylor said. \"That does not mean, however, that adults have to affirm everything that a child believes.\"\n\nThe American Medical Association wrote in a 2021 letter that \"trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.\" The AMA recommends enabling \"young people to explore and live the gender that they choose.\"\n\nTaylor and Sen. Cherielynn Westrich, R-Ottumwa, signed off on the proposal, making it eligible for consideration in the Senate Education Committee.\n\nMore:Will Iowa's broad 'school choice' law mean no choice for LGBTQ and special-needs students?\n\nSchools would require parental consent for transgender accommodations\n\nMeanwhile, House lawmakers advanced House File 9, a bill that would require schools to obtain parental consent before \"facilitating any accommodation\" that affirms a transgender student, including using a new name or pronouns.\n\nSupporters of the legislation say parents know what's best for their children — and schools shouldn't keep secrets from families.\n\n\"Children are the sole responsibility of the parents. A teacher is not the parent; the teacher works for the parent at the school that he or she is employed with,\" said Patty Alexander, a former Indianola school board candidate. \"We need educators, schools and administrators to stay in their lane.”\n\nBut some worry that transgender students may be thrust into unsafe situations as a result of the bill if their parents do not accept them. Lisa Stone, a teacher and the parent of a transgender daughter, said students should be able to express themselves safely at school, even if they can't at home.\n\n“In a perfect world this topic wouldn’t even be an issue,” she said. “All kids would grow up in a safe and nurturing home with supportive and loving parents. They wouldn’t be afraid to talk to their parents about anything. But this isn’t a perfect world, and some kids fear their parents.”\n\nThe House Education Committee moved the bill along party lines Tuesday evening.\n\n\"It is never a good policy to keep secrets from parents,\" said Rep. Skyler Wheeler, R-Hull.\n\nOver a hundred LGBTQ Iowans and allies gathered at the Capitol on Wednesday for the annual LGBTQ Day on the Hill event. Sen. Liz Bennett, the only openly LGBTQ senator in Iowa, told the crowd she was \"overcome with sadness, fury, anger\" at the proposals advancing at the Capitol.\n\n\"(These bills) are meanspirited, they are purposefully misguided, and they are wrong,\" Bennett, D-Cedar Rapids, said.\n\nSenate bill takes aim at social-emotional learning\n\nMany of the same conservative speakers who supported the gender identity bills celebrated another bill in the Senate to restrict \"social-emotional learning\" and surveys in schools.\n\nSenate File 85 would require parents to opt-in before their children participated in surveys that ask about risky behavior, psychological problems, sexual orientation, political views or a family's income level. The bill would also instruct the Department of Education to stop disseminating information about \"social-emotional learning.\"\n\nThe Iowa Department of Education uses a popular social-emotional learning framework that prioritizes self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making. Social-emotional learning or SEL curriculum includes lessons that are designed to help students build life skills, regulate behavior and learn how to solve problems.\n\nMore:Iowa parents petitioned to ditch their school's 'liberal' curriculum. The district said no\n\nBut Sen. Sandy Salmon, a Republican who authored Senate File 85, argued that the state's social-emotional learning curriculum includes \"critical race theory\" and that it says gender identity is fluid and homosexuality is \"an acceptable alternative way of life that should be affirmed.\"\n\n\"These also conflict with many families' religious or political beliefs,\" Salmon said.\n\nSupporters of the bill echoed Salmon, arguing that social-emotional learning is a vessel for schools to inflict liberal values and beliefs on students.\n\nRepresentatives for education and mental health groups countered that social-emotional learning is focused on helping students understand their own emotions and how to get along with others — not to further a political agenda.\n\nConservative parents have been a driving force in Iowa politics over the last several years, as the COVID-19 pandemic spurred people to get more involved in their kids' education.\n\nThe increased attention on schools led to debates over inappropriate library books, candidacies by conservatives in local school board elections, and demand for more transparency and control for parents.\n\nLawmakers this week also advanced House File 5, a bill that requires more transparency from school districts, and House Study Bill 112, which creates new penalties for schools that teach about certain concepts, such as the idea that Iowa or the U.S. is systemically racist.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds centered her reelection campaign on \"parent choice,\" and she championed the passage of a bill to use state funds to send kids to private schools.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller contributed reporting.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

It eventually broke apart and crashed into the Gulf.\n\nSpaceX later confirmed the rocket's flight termination system, or FTS, was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle for safety reasons.\n\nAside from the separation failure, it also appeared three of the rocket's 33 Raptor engines failed to ignite at liftoff.\n\nDespite the hardware failures, Elon Musk's company SpaceX largely considered the mission a success. Teams initially had hoped to see the rocket's engines ignite, then see the vehicle clear the tower. Anything else, SpaceX said, meant extra data for engineers to review.\n\n\"From a milestone standpoint, our main goal is to clear the pad, (meaning ascend past the 500-foot launch tower without a failure),\" said Kate Tice, an engineering manager at SpaceX, in the launch webcast. \"Every milestone beyond that is a bonus. The farther we fly, the more data we collect.\"\n\nGraphics:How SpaceX Starship compares Artemis rocket\n\nPreviously:SpaceX scrubs launch of Starship's first integrated test flight from Texas\n\nHad everything gone according to plan, Starship would have cleared the tower, then flown over the Gulf of Mexico. Just before the three-minute mark, Starship and Super Heavy would have separated, and the latter would have attempted a soft water landing. Starship would have continued to an altitude of about 150 miles before a soft water landing of its own near Hawaii.\n\nAn attempt to launch Starship earlier this week was scrubbed because of technical problems with a frozen valve in the Super Heavy booster. But technicians were able to clear the problem quickly and turn the vehicle around for another attempt 72 hours later.\n\n\"Congrats to SpaceX on Starship’s first integrated flight test,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. \"Every great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great risk comes great reward. Looking forward to all that SpaceX learns, to the next flight test — and beyond.\"\n\nSpaceX is using Starbase, an operations and production area near Brownsville, Texas, for prototyping and building the first Starships. Low-lying and close to the ocean, the area is much like Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center, especially during the Apollo days. Before SpaceX, there was no space industry presence there.\n\nStarship, however, isn't just limited to Texas. SpaceX plans on launching the massive vehicle from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center once the prototyping phase is over and plans shift to operational missions. Overall, the test flight showed significant progress for SpaceX, though it did also reveal some pain points.\n\n\"I would say this is within the envelope of what I expected for this launch,\" Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who maintains a detailed database of launches, told FLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"This is toward the more successful end of what I expected.\"\n\nMeet the SpaceX Starship:It's larger and more powerful than Artemis SLS. But will it fly?Clearing the pad and its 500-foot launch tower, McDowell said, was definitely a success for SpaceX. But in the process, it did appear the launch mount and some surrounding hardware took a beating beyond what many expected. And the failure to separate first and second stages needs to be understood, too.\n\n\"It's still early days ... and you've got to wait for the failure report,\" McDowell said. \"But it's clear they bought down a lot of risk with this launch. They showed (the Raptor engines) work and they've shown that the vehicle can get through Max-Q (the period of maximum stress on the rocket) and even fly in circles for a bit, so clearly the structural design is pretty good.\"\n\nOn the downside, McDowell said, \"it looks like maybe the launch mount isn't as robust as it needs to be.\"\n\nStarship isn't alone in that struggle. Another heavy-lift rocket that launched recently, NASA's Space Launch System, also left behind significantly more damage than anticipated after its debut mission in November. Elevator doors at KSC's pad 39B were blown off, a swath of land was scorched, and the mobile launcher was damaged beyond original estimates.\n\nMusk sees Starship as the vehicle that will launch massive payloads to Earth orbit, take humans to the moon, and eventually settle on Mars. The vehicle is critical to deploying the company's next-generation Starlink internet satellites – necessary for increasing profitability of the internet constellation – and has been selected by NASA to help deliver Artemis program astronauts to the surface of the moon. The latter involves more than $4 billion in awards from NASA.\n\nAt Kennedy Space Center, meanwhile, SpaceX teams were targeting no earlier than April 26 for the next Florida launch. A three-core Falcon Heavy rocket is set to fly at about 7:30 p.m. EDT that evening, though timelines have not yet been finalized. Neither the two side boosters nor the center booster will be recovered after liftoff, so no local sonic booms this time.\n\nWhat is Starship?\n\nStarship is SpaceX's version of a next-generation launch system designed to take humans, cargo, and payloads to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\n\nIt's been likened to something out of science fiction thanks to its reflective, stainless steel outer shell.\n\nThe vehicle comes in two parts: Super Heavy, a massive booster outfitted with 33 Raptor engines that will lift Starship, a 164-foot-tall spacecraft that can transport humans and cargo beyond low-Earth orbit. It produces more thrust than the Saturn V rocket of the Apollo era and NASA's current Space Launch System.\n\nTo date, SpaceX is estimated to have spent at least several billion dollars on the Starship program.\n\nWhy is Starship important?\n\nMusk's reason for efforting Starship and Super Heavy hinges on his belief that humanity needs to become a multi-planetary, space-faring species sooner rather than later.\n\nMusk sees Starship as the vehicle that will help SpaceX fulfill its vision of putting human boots on Mars. He ultimately wants hundreds of people traveling to the red planet in each Starship.\n\nNASA last year awarded SpaceX $2.9 billion specifically for Starship, which is envisioned as the lunar lander for the agency's Artemis program. If that architecture works out, it will take the next set of American astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon during the Artemis III mission. The astronauts will use NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule to reach lunar orbit before docking with Starship, which will be waiting for them.\n\n\"As part of (the original) contract, SpaceX will also conduct an uncrewed demonstration mission to the moon prior to Artemis III,\" NASA said late last year when it awarded a second contract to SpaceX for Starship development worth $1.15 billion.\n\nSo far, the rocket has only made short sub-orbital test flights. An orbital flight is a major step toward preparing for that moon mission which is expected sometime before 2030.\n\nHas Starship launched before?\n\nPrevious test flights, which often ended explosively, only featured the Starship vehicle itself, but this time the combined 400-foot vehicle is launching from Texas.\n\nSpaceX began building the first stainless steel prototype of Starship, known as \"Starhopper,\" in Texas, where it successfully launched on a minute-long, low-altitude test flight known as a \"hop\" in August 2019. A series of suborbital test flights were designed to stress systems and components to inform the production of larger prototypes.\n\nIn December 2020, the much larger Starship Serial Number 8 prototype was the first to successfully launch from Starbase. After liftoff, it sailed to a high-altitude, suborbital apogee and appeared to hover momentarily. Then, it turned around for a \"belly flop\" descent back to Earth. Though it exploded just short of its landing pad, all of SpaceX's core test objectives for that flight were achieved.\n\nIn February 2021, the Starship Serial Number 9 prototype took flight. The 165-foot vehicle launched on a brief test and automatically throttled down its Raptor engines at about 33,000 feet. It then performed the \"belly flop\" using adjustable fins to establish a trajectory back toward the launch site. Though the test achieved SpaceX's primary objective, SN9 failed to fully flip from \"belly-down\" to an upright position, causing it to explode on impact.\n\nSpaceX's third high-altitude Starship flight in March 2021 saw Starship Serial Number 10 successfully complete all objectives and execute the first landing of the next-generation vehicle. But minutes after sticking the landing, the spacecraft unexpectedly exploded.\n\nStarship Serial Number 15 was the first to launch, land, and remain intact. In May 2021, SN15 took off from a concrete pad and ascended to an altitude of 10 kilometers, or 33,000 feet, before using its \"body\" as an airbrake to descend back to the launch site. Just before touchdown, it rapidly flipped around and gently landed under the power of two Raptor engines – a first for the program.\n\nContact Jamie Groh at JGroh@floridatoday.com and follow her on Twitter at @AlteredJamie.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com.

After clearing the pad and appearing to take off successfully from Starbase, the vehicle's Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage failed to separate as planned and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX considers this mission mostly a success.\n\n---\n\nFollow live as SpaceX teams in Texas target 9:28 a.m. EDT Thursday, April 20, for the second attempt at launching the first test flight of the company's fully integrated Starship vehicle.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the test will mark the first time the Super Heavy booster below and Starship vehicle on top take flight as a combined system. SpaceX teams were forced to stand down from the first attempt Monday, April 17, because of a frozen valve on the first-stage booster.\n\nAfter liftoff from Starbase, Starship and Super Heavy will fly east over the Gulf of Mexico. Once the booster's job is done, it will separate and attempt a soft landing in the waters of the Gulf. Starship will continue on through the Straits of Florida, perform nearly one orbit, and, to ensure public safety, end in the Pacific Ocean with a controlled water landing of its own.\n\nThere is no customer payload flying on this demonstration mission.\n\nStarship's short ride:SpaceX Starship successfully launches from Texas, explodes over Gulf of Mexico\n\nSpaceX Starship launch:Here's everything you need to know about the launch from Texas\n\nLatest SpaceX Florida launch:Falcon 9 lifts off from Cape Canaveral with 21 Starlink satellites\n\nFollow live updates below:\n\nStarship lost after separation failure\n\n9:40 a.m. EDT: After clearing the pad and appearing to take off successfully from Starbase, the vehicle's Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage failed to separate as planned. Just after three-and-a-half minutes into flight, the combined stack appeared to break apart and crash into the Gulf of Mexico. Five of 33 Raptor engines were also lost early in the flight.\n\nSpaceX considers this mission mostly a success – though the booster and Starship did not get to attempt soft water landings in the Gulf and Pacific Ocean, respectively, teams were at least hoping to clear the pad and gather data.\n\nLIFTOFF of Starship!\n\n9:33 a.m. EDT: SpaceX's Starship vehicle has launched from Starbase, Texas, on the company's first integrated demonstration mission!\n\nNew Starship launch time\n\n9:33 a.m. EDT: The countdown has resumed for liftoff of Starship from Starbase, Texas. On for 9:33 a.m. EDT!\n\nLaunch on hold\n\n9:28 a.m. EDT: SpaceX has paused the countdown to hold at T-minus 40 seconds. Today's window closes in an hour. Two issues: booster tank pressurization issue, but this has been resolved.

The Coast Guard has also confirmed no boats are violating the range.\n\nStarship countdown going as planned\n\n9:15 a.m. EDT: SpaceX confirms weather, range, and vehicle are all still \"go\" for liftoff at 9:28 a.m. EDT (8:28 a.m. local time in Texas). If teams need more time, today's window runs 62 minutes.\n\nThousands gathering in Texas for Starship\n\n9:05 a.m. EDT: Thousands are gathering near Starbase this morning to watch the first launch of Starship. SpaceX's Kate Tice provides more context on today's launch: \"From a milestone standpoint, our main goal is to clear the pad. Every milestone beyond that is a bonus. The farther we fly, the more data we can collect.\"\n\nSpaceX Starship approaching T-0\n\n8:50 a.m. EDT: So far, the fueling and countdown process is continuing as planned. Located on the southernmost tip of Texas, Starbase is seeing some foggy conditions but nothing significant enough to hold back an on-time liftoff. That's still targeted for 9:28 a.m. EDT.\n\nInside an hour to Starship launch\n\n8:35 a.m. EDT: Now inside an hour to launch of Starship and Super Heavy. Generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, the combined system will become the most powerful rocket ever when those 33 Raptor engines fire up.

The explosion came when Space Force officials overseeing the launch detonated the rocket because it tipped sideways and off course, the agency said in a statement.\n\nAerospace news:FAA grounds Virgin Galactic while it investigates July 11 space flight\n\nMore:Firefly Aerospace plans to add 680 jobs in Cedar Park\n\nFirefly said it still considers the mission a success despite not reaching orbit, which would have been a rare achievement for a first launch.\n\n“While we did not meet all of our mission objectives, we did achieve a number of them: successful first stage ignition, liftoff of the pad, progression to supersonic speed, and we obtained a substantial amount of fight data,” Firefly said in a Thursday night statement on Twitter.\n\nFirefly is among an emerging group of launch providers that serves the small satellite market. Founded in 2014 in Hawthorne, Calif. the company relocated to Cedar Park later that year. The company has said its goal is to become the \"preeminent end-to-end space transportation company\" in the small space industrial sector.\n\n\"Alpha experienced an anomaly during the first stage ascent that resulted in the loss of the vehicle. As we gather more information, additional details will be provided,\" Firefly said in a tweet Thursday.\n\nThe rocket, which will have a starting price of $15 million per flight when it is in commercial service, is designed to be able to deliver payloads ranging from 1,000 kilograms to 8,000 kilograms into space. Firefly was originally scheduled to launch the Alpha rocket last year but was delayed.\n\nThursday was the first test of Alpha’s orbital flight capabilities. The company said it is too early to draw any conclusions about the cause of the problem but is investigating the issue in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration and Vandenberg Space Force Base.\n\nPreviously:Firefly Aerospace raises $75 million as the Cedar Park company prepares for first rocket launch\n\nFirefly live-streamed the event on Youtube through aerospace streamer Tim Dodd, who goes by Everyday Astronaut, providing viewers with a firsthand look at the launch and the ability to hear mission control, the countdown and light-hearted comments such as “burn baby burn,” “send it” and confirmation that the rocket was “pointy end up, flamy end down.”\n\nThe company cleared the area prior to the unmanned launch and noted there were no injuries related to the mission. Firefly had a four-hour window to attempt the launch, and the rocket ultimately lifted off on its second attempt. Its first attempt was canceled in countdown about an hour before.\n\nIn a statement, Firefly said it intends to use the data it collected from the test flight and apply it to future missions. It said the company’s engineers are combing through thousands of lines of ground and flight-system data to understand the issue.\n\nThe rocket’s failure to reach lower earth orbit isn't unusual, especially for a first launch. Several of Firefly’s competitors in the satellite market — Astra, Rocket Lab, and Virgin Orbit — all saw failures on their first attempts.\n\nPrior to the fiery flight, Firefly CEO Tom Markusic, who previously worked at both SpaceX and Blue Origin, had warned that the launch could end before the rocket reached orbit.\n\n\"This is a test flight of a rocket,” Markusic said at the time. “At SpaceX we crashed three of them before we got it right. So it'll be an interesting show one way or another, and we're very transparent so hopefully, we'll be able to stream all that live, for better or worse.\"\n\nThursday's mission was dubbed Dedicated Research and Education Accelerator Mission, or DREAM, and Alpha carried a small payload that included photos, messages from pediatric patients, a children’s book called “Henry the Astronaut,” a robotics project created by students at Austin’s Anderson High School, DNA samples from plants, tiny satellites, a drag sail, and memorabilia and art provided by schools and educational institutions.\n\nFirefly intends to continue to test and launch Alpha in the future. For now, the rocket is grounded until the FAA investigates and confirms the problems identified in the test flight won’t affect public safety.\n\nThe company has a number of other projects in development, including a larger rocket — called Beta — and a moon lander that's scheduled to deliver payloads for NASA in 2023. Firefly also has plans for a reusable rocket called Gamma.\n\nThe Alpha launch comes as the rocket maker is rapidly expanding and adding hundreds more jobs in the Austin area, with the help of $4.3 million in taxpayer-funded incentives In May, the company said it was adding 682 news jobs within 10 years. It also planned to spend about $10 million to purchase a new building in Cedar Park. Firefly already has been on a hiring spree, and now has close to 500 employees.\n\nIt also announced in May that it had raised a $75 million funding round that the company was valued at $1 billion. At the time, Firefly said it planned to raise an additional $300 million through 2025 following Alpha’s launch.\n\nAt the time, Markusic said 2021 was “proving to be a breakout year” for the company.\n\n\"Space is expected to be the fastest-growing industry of the 21st century, and Firefly is determined to be perfectly positioned to lead the way in this new emerging space economy,\" he said in May.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/business/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-ussf-44-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, world's most powerful rocket, launches ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy — a towering, three-pronged vehicle that is the most powerful operational rocket in the world — returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2019.\n\nThe rocket launched at 9:41 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy debuted in 2018 to much fanfare as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk elected to launch his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars’ orbital path.\n\nSince that first test mission, SpaceX has launched only two other Falcon Heavy missions, both in 2019. One sent a hulking TV and phone service satellite to orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat, and the other delivered a batch of experimental satellites for the US Department of Defense.\n\nBut the rocket had not launched since 2019, as the vast majority of SpaceX’s missions don’t require the Falcon Heavy’s amped up power. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, on the other hand, has launched nearly 50 missions so far this year alone.\n\nWith each Falcon Heavy launch, the rocket puts on a dramatic showing back on Earth.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s mission, the company only attempted to recover two of the Falcon Heavy rocket’s first-stage rocket boosters — the tall white sticks that are strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff.\n\nAs planned, the center booster was left to plunge into the ocean, where it will remain, because it did not have enough leftover fuel to guide its journey home, according to a news release from the US military’s Space Systems Command.\n\nThe two side boosters, however, made their signature synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline.\n\nIn the past, SpaceX has attempted to land all three of the rocket’s boosters back on landing pads on land and at sea so that they can be refurbished and reused on future missions. It does this to cut down on mission costs. The company has yet to suceed at retrieving all three, although it’s come dramatically close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket’s center booster touched down on a sea-faring platform. But then, rough waves at sea toppled it over.\n\nAll about this rocket\n\nThough the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two massive rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title.\n\nNASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket, which is currently slated to attempt its inaugural launch later in November to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, is sitting in the Kennedy Space Center’s towering Vehicle Assembly Building, which lies just a few miles from the launch pad where the Falcon Heavy will take flight.\n\nWhile the Falcon Heavy gives off about five million pounds of thrust, SLS is expected to put off as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust — 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets that powered the mid-20th Century moon landings.\n\nAnd just across the Gulf Coast, at SpaceX’s experimental facilities in South Texas, the company is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators, it could take flight before the end of the year.\n\nThe Starship system is expected to out-power both SLS and Falcon Heavy by a wide margin. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust alone.\n\nBoth the SLS rocket and SpaceX’s Starship are integral to NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in half a century.\n\nSpaceX also has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in the hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there.\n\nAll about this mission\n\nThere is not much publicly available information about the USSF-44 mission. In a news release, the US military’s Space Systems Command said only that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of the Space Systems Command’s Innovation and Prototyping Delta, which is focused on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space as well as a range of other activities.\n\nThe Space System Command declined to provide additional information about the mission when reached by email. It referred questions to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which also declined comment.\n\nThe US military is one of the primary drivers of the domestic rocket economy, doling out lucrative launch contracts that are coveted by private launch companies including SpaceX and its chief competitor in the area, United Launch Alliance, which is a joint operation between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2016/09/01/spacex-falcon9-rocket-explosion-one-of-many-florida-launch-failures/89716540/", "title": "SpaceX Falcon 9 explosion one of many Florida launch failures", "text": "Emre Kelly\n\nFLORIDA TODAY\n\nThe explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral is just one of many that have rocked the Space Coast over the decades.\n\nThe Thursday morning static fire test was in advance of a planned Saturday launch attempt from Launch Complex 40 of an Israeli communications satellite.

Be ready.”\n\nThe Cygnus is on track to rendezvous with the International Space Station and its six-person crew around 6:10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nStation crew members could see the launch as they flew about 250 miles overhead, and NASA astronaut and Expedition 45 crew member Scott Kelly shared a gorgeous picture on Twitter of the rocket climbing into space at sunset.\n\nThe rocket and spacecraft appeared as a bright point of light pushing into the blackness of space, trailing behind an exhaust plume that stretched through bands of deep blue, yellow, orange and red light.\n\nThe scene was a welcome one not only for its beauty, but because the station needs the supplies now on their way.\n\nReserves of food and spare parts in orbit have been strained by three failed resupply missions over the past 13 months, including one each by NASA’s two commercial U.S. partners, Orbital ATK and SpaceX.\n\nThe mishaps began in October 2014 when Orbital ATK’s Antares rocket lost thrust and exploded seconds after lifting off from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket disintegrated about two minutes into a flight from Cape Canaveral in June this year.\n\nAstronaut Scott Kelly still upbeat after months in space\n\nAs a result, the current Cygnus mission would be the first U.S. delivery of cargo since April, the last time SpaceX’s Dragon capsule reached the station. A Cygnus last reached the station in July 2014.\n\n“We are very proud to be back in space again,” Culbertson told reporters after the launch. “It’s very exciting to finally be heading to the International Space Station again.”\n\nOrbital ATK bought two Cygnus rides from Florida on ULA’s Atlas V while re-fitting its own Antares rocket with new engines.\n\nLaunching for the 60th time without a major failure, the Atlas V did not disappoint on Sunday, placing the Cygnus in an orbit that Orbital ATK described as \"right on the money.”\n\n“This is about as good as it gets,” Vernon Thorp, ULA’s manager for NASA missions, told NASA TV. “I know that the crew up on the ISS is really looking forward to getting this load of cargo.”\n\nThat cargo includes several months of food, a spacesuit jet pack and high-pressure oxygen and nitrogen tanks to help replenish the station's air supply.\n\nIt will also support dozens of science experiments, some run by students. One tiny satellite to be deployed from the ISS, built by elementary students from St. Thomas More Cathedral School in Virginia, carries a camera and a crucifix with a medallion blessed by Pope Francis.\n\nInternational Space Station: 15 years of exploration, cooperation\n\nAnother experiment will test flame-resistant materials that could benefit first responders.\n\nThe mission is Orbital ATK's fourth of 10 under a NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract worth more than $2 billion.\n\nThe launch was ULA’s last of a dozen this year, all successes, and the company plans as many as 16 launches next year. The next one is targeted for Feb. 3.\n\nSpaceX hopes to return its Falcon 9 rocket to flight with a commercial satellite launch from Cape Canaveral this month, on a date still to be confirmed.

Just after three-and-a-half minutes into flight, the combined stack appeared to break apart and crash into the Gulf of Mexico. Five of 33 Raptor engines were also lost early in the flight.\n\nSpaceX considers this mission mostly a success – though the booster and Starship did not get to attempt soft water landings in the Gulf and Pacific Ocean, respectively, teams were at least hoping to clear the pad and gather data.\n\n---\n\nAll eyes are on the southernmost tip of Texas, where SpaceX is gearing up to launch its massive Starship system on the first orbital flight from its production and operations facility called Starbase.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, the test set for early Thursday, April 20, will mark the first time the Super Heavy booster below and Starship vehicle on top take flight as a combined system. SpaceX teams were forced to stand down from the first attempt Monday, April 17, because of a frozen valve on the first-stage booster.\n\nAssuming technicians can isolate and fix the issue, the next opportunity to fly is expected during a 62-minute window that opens at 9:28 a.m. EDT, or 8:28 a.m. local time in Texas. Look for FLORIDA TODAY's live coverage to begin 90 minutes before liftoff at https://www.floridatoday.com/space/.\n\nHere's everything you need to know before liftoff:\n\nWhat's the plan for Starship's test flight?\n\nAfter liftoff from Starbase, Starship and Super Heavy will fly east over the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOnce the booster's job is done, it will separate and attempt a soft landing in the waters of the Gulf.\n\nStarship will continue on through the Straits of Florida, perform nearly one orbit, and, to ensure public safety, end in the Pacific Ocean with a controlled water landing of its own.\n\nThere is no customer payload flying on this demonstration mission.\n\nWhat is Starship?\n\nStarship is SpaceX's version of a next-generation launch system designed to take humans, cargo, and payloads to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\n\nIt's been likened to something out of science fiction thanks to its reflective, stainless steel outer shell.\n\nThe vehicle comes in two parts: Super Heavy, a massive booster outfitted with 33 Raptor engines that will lift Starship, a 164-foot-tall spacecraft that can transport humans and cargo beyond low-Earth orbit. It produces more thrust than the Saturn V rocket of the Apollo era and NASA's current Space Launch System.\n\nTo date, SpaceX is estimated to have spent at least several billion dollars on the Starship program.\n\nSpaceX introduces Starship:Details of next-generation launch system and plans to fly to the moon revealed in 2019\n\nHere's what we learned in 2019:SpaceX CEO Elon Musk provides Starship from Texas\n\nMusk's 2022 Starship update:SpaceX's Starship program has roots on the Space Coast, despite primary development in Texas\n\nWhy is Starship important?\n\nMusk's reason for Starship and Super Heavy hinges on his belief that humanity needs to become a multi-planetary, space-faring species sooner rather than later.\n\nMusk sees Starship as the vehicle that will help SpaceX fulfill its vision of putting human boots on Mars. He ultimately wants hundreds of people traveling to the red planet in each Starship.\n\nNASA last year awarded SpaceX $2.9 billion specifically for Starship, which is envisioned as the lunar lander for the agency's Artemis program. If that architecture works out, it will take the next set of American astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon during the Artemis III mission. The astronauts will use NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule to reach lunar orbit before docking with Starship, which will be waiting for them.\n\n\"As part of (the original) contract, SpaceX will also conduct an uncrewed demonstration mission to the moon prior to Artemis III,\" NASA said late last year when it awarded a second contract to SpaceX for Starship development worth $1.15 billion.\n\nSo far, the rocket has only made short sub-orbital test flights. An orbital flight is a major step toward preparing for that moon mission which is expected sometime before 2030.\n\nAnd Starship's orbital test flight means business for Florida, too: if all goes well with the orbital flight test and the program overall, SpaceX plans on launching Starship from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in the coming years. Missions with Starlink satellites, science payloads, and flights with crews destined for the moon and Mars are all in the planning phase.\n\nHas Starship launched before?\n\nPrevious test flights, which often ended explosively, only featured the Starship vehicle itself, but this time the combined 400-foot vehicle is launching from Texas.\n\nSpaceX began building the first stainless steel prototype of Starship, known as \"Starhopper,\" in Texas, where it successfully launched on a minute-long, low-altitude test flight known as a \"hop\" in August 2019. A series of suborbital test flights were designed to stress systems and components to inform the production of larger prototypes.\n\nIn December 2020, the much larger Starship Serial Number 8 prototype was the first to successfully launch from Starbase. After liftoff, it sailed to a high-altitude, suborbital apogee and appeared to hover momentarily. Then, it turned around for a \"belly flop\" descent back to Earth. Though it exploded just short of its landing pad, all of SpaceX's core test objectives for that flight were achieved.\n\nPressure Test:SpaceX Starship prototype sent flying after failed test in Texas\n\nSN8 high-altitude test:SpaceX Starship launches on successful flight from Texas before exploding on landing\n\nIn February 2021, the Starship Serial Number 9 prototype took flight. The 165-foot vehicle launched on a brief test and automatically throttled down its Raptor engines at about 33,000 feet. It then performed the \"belly flop\" using adjustable fins to establish a trajectory back toward the launch site. Though the test achieved SpaceX's primary objective, SN9 failed to fully flip from \"belly-down\" to an upright position, causing it to explode on impact.\n\nSpaceX's third high-altitude Starship flight in March 2021 saw Starship Serial Number 10 successfully complete all objectives and execute the first landing of the next-generation vehicle. But minutes after sticking the landing, the spacecraft unexpectedly exploded.\n\nStarship Serial Number 15 was the first to launch, land, and remain intact. In May 2021, SN15 took off from a concrete pad and ascended to an altitude of 10 kilometers, or 33,000 feet, before using its \"body\" as an airbrake to descend back to the launch site. Just before touchdown, it rapidly flipped around and gently landed under the power of two Raptor engines – a first for the program.\n\nSN9 & the second test flight:SpaceX launches Starship SN9, explodes on impact\n\nStarship SN10 nails landing:The third test flight was a success, then Starship blew up\n\nA first for the Starhip program:SpaceX launched the Starship SN15 prototype, finally stuck a landing, and it didn't blow up\n\nHow to watch the SpaceX Starship launch\n\nSpaceX is currently targeting no earlier than 9:28 a.m. ET Thursday, April 20, for Starship and Super Heavy’s debut liftoff during a 62-minute launch window.\n\nThough SpaceX is perhaps most well-known for landing its Falcon 9 boosters on land and drone ships, Starship and Super Heavy will be doomed to a watery grave for this mission.

He later berated the competition’s judges for failing to distinguish between the two. “I applied as a cheeky monkey, to find out if the competitions are prepared for AI images to enter,” Eldagsen wrote on his website. “They are not”.\n\nA spokesperson for the award accused Eldagsen of “deliberate attempts at misleading us”, said The Art Newspaper.\n\n‘Machines have crossed a threshold’\n\n“Our machines have crossed a threshold,” declared Kevin Kelly in Wired. “All our lives, we have been reassured that computers were incapable of being truly creative. Yet, suddenly, millions of people are now using a new breed of AIs to generate stunning, never-before-seen pictures.”\n\nEldagsen’s image is an “immensely evocative scene”, agreed Zoe Williams in The Guardian. The judges may feel like they were conned, but “maybe, when done well enough, AI images can’t be distinguished from photography by anybody”.\n\nEldagsen’s image was created using DALL-E 2, an image generator developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based company. Platforms like DALL-E 2 require prompts, which are a set of instructions from a user, to create their image.\n\nAdvocates say you still have to be creatively minded to produce these prompts. “Two thirds of the prompts are only good if you have knowledge and skills, when you know how photography works, when you know art history,” said Eldagsen.\n\nBesides, artists have always used past work to create new work. AI systems like DALL-E are “just another tool”, Steven Sacks, a gallery owner, told CNN Business.\n\n‘A sheer lack of effort’\n\nControversy over new art-making technologies is “nothing new”, said The New York Times.

At the moment “these images are being generated by scraping our images, taking them off our websites, but there’s no remuneration there”, he said.\n\nSome fear AI will put artists and photographers out of work, while trade bodies are demanding greater regulation. The ramifications could be even more troubling. “I think this [is] redefinition of what creativity is – there’s never been such a huge gap between the sheer lack of effort or work or anything going in and the huge sophistication that then results coming out,” comic-book artist Dave McKean told the broadcaster.\n\nThe real challenge could be combating the rise in fake news and fake images more generally.\n\n“The question isn’t, ‘Who made this art, a human or a machine?’ or “‘an machine-art be real?’ concluded Zoe Williams in The Guardian. “It’s more fundamental: how much truth is there in my reality?”", "authors": ["Felicity Capon"], "publish_date": "2023/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960558/quiz-of-the-week-14-21-april", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 14 - 21 April | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

A “highly decorated” 14th-century manuscript called Liber Regalis, or Royal Book, “acts as an instruction book for the running order of the ceremony”, said The Telegraph.\n\nHowever, speculated Tatler, it has been suggested that this year’s coronation will be “shorter than its forebears”, meaning the King “may reduce the number of robe changes”.\n\nNevertheless, a coronation would not be complete without a crown, and King Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Queen Consort, will “don crowns pulled from the Tower of London, where they have been guarded since the 17th century”, said Harper’s Bazaar.

That could raise ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter sparked an international outcry on Thursday by suspending a number of journalists at major news organizations who cover him.\n\nBut a different and possibly related move that Twitter took around the same time, against a fast-growing rival, could open the company up to regulatory scrutiny, some legal experts say.\n\nIn addition to suspending journalists who had been covering a controversy related to the third-party tracking of Musk’s private jet, the platform also suspended the official Twitter account of rival Mastodon after it tweeted about the ElonJet account.\n\nTwitter users began tweeting links to their Mastodon profiles, some half-jokingly telling followers where they could be found on the alternative platform in case they, too, were banned from Twitter without warning.\n\nSoon, however, Twitter began throwing up roadblocks — marking links to Mastodon as “unsafe” and potentially malicious, blocking tweets containing those links and preventing users from adding Mastodon links to their profiles.\n\nNow, legal experts are pondering whether there may be anticompetitive or other regulatory implications arising from Twitter’s blocking of Mastodon links.\n\n“You could see all sorts of problems, both from a competition and a consumer protection standpoint,” said Bill Baer, who has served as the former top antitrust official at the Justice Department and at the Federal Trade Commission across two separate US administrations.\n\nThose questions, which bring to bear on Twitter some of the antitrust scrutiny that’s been leveled at larger tech giants Meta and Google, come just as Twitter faces intensifying questions about its ability to comply with a US government consent decree — along with concerns about hate speech on the platform and the possible precedent set by its suspension of journalists reporting on Musk.\n\nTwitter, which has cut much of its public relations team, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitter’s restrictions on Mastodon\n\nAs news of the journalist suspensions spread, many Twitter users announced they were migrating or expanding to Mastodon. But the sudden restrictions Twitter placed on link-sharing appeared to thwart some attempts at referring users to the alternative platform.\n\n“Twitter is now attempting to prevent its users from navigating to the official social media accounts of elected officials on other platforms,” said Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, sharing a screenshot of a Twitter system message warning that Beyer’s link to his Mastodon profile was “potentially spammy or unsafe.”\n\nOther users, such as New York Times editor Patrick LaForge, observed that attempts to add Mastodon links to Twitter profiles were producing error messages from Twitter warning that the links were “considered malware.”\n\nCNN confirmed some of the reports with its own testing, finding that Twitter blocked attempts to tweet links referring users to a Mastodon profile. Sharing Mastodon user handles as plain text, and using link-shortening services that obscured the destination URL, allowed users to get around the restrictions. But the link blocking continued into Friday afternoon.\n\nMusk has falsely claimed that the suspended journalists shared real-time information on his physical location, violating Twitter policies. After one of the suspended reporters challenged Musk’s claim in a Twitter Spaces event that Musk spontaneously dropped in on Thursday evening, the new Twitter owner abruptly left the conversation.\n\nEugen Rochko, the founder and CEO of Mastodon, has not publicly addressed Twitter’s link blocking, but has amplified a public report about it. CNN has reached out to Rochko for comment.\n\nA fast-growing rival\n\nWhile there are some differences in how the two platforms operate, Mastodon’s user experience replicates much of the basic Twitter functionality. Twitter is much larger, boasting some 238 million users to Mastodon’s 2.5 million, but the latter has grown rapidly since Musk acquired Twitter. In the first week and a half after Musk closed his Twitter deal, Mastodon gained hundreds of thousands of users, and the migration has only continued since then.\n\nTwitter’s move to block links to a nascent rival could be the type of activity to pique the interest of the Federal Trade Commission, whose chair, Lina Khan, has vowed to crack down on novel ways in which tech platforms might try to hurt competition.\n\nIf regulators could prove Twitter intentionally used the link blocking to preserve a form of market dominance and to keep a potential rival at bay, then they might have a case, legal experts say.\n\nIn general, companies aren’t obligated to do business with each other and can freely choose their business partners. But a dominant firm that’s said to have “market power” can potentially violate antitrust law if they refuse to deal with other parties.\n\nThis notion of a “duty to deal” is likely the most relevant to this situation, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former FTC antitrust official.\n\n“If Twitter has market power, it may have some duties to deal with competitors,” Slaiman said. “Duties to deal is an area of antitrust law that I think is really important in the tech sector, but has been aggressively narrowed” in recent decades.\n\nUnder Khan, a vocal tech skeptic, the FTC has shown an expanded interest in duty-to-deal cases through recent policy statements, Slaiman added. And during the Trump administration, the FTC alleged Facebook had acted anticompetitively by effectively blocking access to Vine, a Twitter-owned video platform, as part of a wider lawsuit seeking to break up the social media giant. (The FTC complaint was later thrown out by a federal judge, but re-filed with slightly different arguments on Khan’s watch.)\n\nA potentially complicated case\n\nA case revolving around duty to deal would likely need to argue that Twitter had harmed itself somehow by restricting Mastodon link-sharing — perhaps by making itself less likely to receive incoming traffic from Mastodon, or by making itself less attractive to advertisers as an open platform. Simultaneously, it would also likely need to show that Twitter’s actions hurt Mastodon even worse, by taking something critical away from it (in this case, potentially, an influx of new users).\n\nBefore that, however, a judge would first have to agree that Twitter enjoys “market power,” or dominance in a specific market that regulators would be expected to describe and explain in any lawsuit. That definition could take a variety of forms, but it would need to pass muster with the judge before prosecutors would even have a shot at arguing that Twitter’s conduct was anticompetitive.\n\nIt could be a tough case, Baer and Slaiman said.\n\nBaer added that Twitter’s link blocking doesn’t just raise potential competition concerns. It also raises questions about Twitter’s stated reasons for blocking the links, and whether those public justifications hold up to scrutiny by consumer protection officials.\n\nAs Beyer tweeted, the link he shared to his own Mastodon profile was not malicious. And prior to Thursday, there did not appear to be grounds for Twitter to claim that Mastodon links were unsafe.\n\nIf Twitter misled the public with its statements about Mastodon links, saying they were spam or malicious when the company knew they were harmless, for example, the FTC could potentially try to argue that Twitter acted unfairly or deceptively, according to Baer.\n\nThe FTC has historically enjoyed broad latitude to prosecute alleged unfair and deceptive business practices. And crucially, those cases don’t require a showing of market power.\n\nWith the FTC already watching Twitter’s behavior closely under Musk, the Mastodon issue may lead to further scrutiny that the company can little afford.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2013/12/02/ufc-to-unveil-digital-network-for-global-expansion-/3797951/", "title": "UFC to unveil digital network for global expansion", "text": "John Morgan\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThe UFC will have 33 events in 2013 and an expected 50 in 2014\n\nThe new network will feature live and on-demand programming\n\nThe first event to be aired will be UFC Fight Night 34 on Jan. 4 in Singapore\n\nLAS VEGAS -- The new year will bring a new online distribution platform for the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

For more tips and warning signs, click here.\n\n“There’s a lot of information we didn’t have before,” Tobias said. “When a company, entity or an individual knows they’re exposing someone else to a risk of harm, then tort law and product liability law is sometimes willing to impose liability.”\n\nWhile he said it’s “unclear” if the lawsuits will indeed be successful, the “arguments being made by plaintiffs and their lawyers in some of these cases are something the companies have to take seriously.”\n\nIndividual lawsuits have been filed against social media companies in the past, but the companies typically have a broad legal liability shield for content posted on their platforms. However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now.

Lane said she takes local news and expands its reach to the state and sometimes the nation and, in turn, national news that has a local link is brought to the WQCS audience.\n\n“Jill has slots in the programming for expanded stories,” Lane said. “For instance, when the Pulse killings occurred in Orlando, we learned that the killer went to college at IRSC, so we were able to link the local angle to the national stories. Other stories have both local and national importance, such as the algae bloom in the St. Lucie River.”\n\nOverall, there are 10 full-time employees at WQCS, plus three part-timers and one IRSC student who is in a work-study program at the station. In addition, students from IRSC have their own show on WQCS and they come up with the story lines for the documentary programming.\n\nLane said the reach of WQCS is larger than the radio station, and the new emphasis is on expanding digitally, to develop streams for mobile devices and feeds for the latest news.\n\n“A lot of the push today is for digital development,” Lane said. “Demographically, our listeners’ average age is in their mid-60s, but we are working to cultivate the millennials, the demographic group that is coming up,” he said. “No matter who our audience is, we want to make sure they are well-informed and part of that is to have public media be more than a radio station,” Lane said.\n\nWQCS can be heard at 88.9 FM, online at http://www.wqcs.org or on an HD radio receiver.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/02/07/new-dispatch-app-brings-news-you-faster-and-customized/4369154001/", "title": "New Dispatch app brings news to you faster and customized", "text": "The Dispatch has a new app, one that brings the news to you faster and allows for a customized reading experience.\n\nThe new app follows the launch of The Dispatch's redesigned website in September.\n\nThose who use the app regularly should have received a prompt to update it.

It’s also planning to expand tests of end-to-end encrypted messages and calls on Instagram.\n\nMeta said it’s also testing a “secure storage” option for end-to-end encrypted conversations, which have been stored only on users’ devices. The new storage service, which Meta says will become the default for storing encrypted conversations on Messenger, would allow users to back up their conversations with Facebook (FB) in case they lose their devices. The company said that it “won’t have access to your messages” in secure storage. Meta says it is only able to see encrypted messages in live conversations or in secure storage if users report them, for example, with harassment concerns.\n\nThe company has for years been working to expand and improve end-to-end encryption on its platforms, with the promise of ensuring that messages are only viewable by members of the conversation and not accessible by the company. These moves have sometimes received pushback from government officials who worry about the impact on law enforcement.\n\nWhatsApp, which is owned by Meta, already enables end-to-end encryption by default. Messenger mobile app users can currently opt-in to end-to-end encryption in conversations. The company has previously pledged to make end-to-end encryption the default for all messages and calls on its platforms globally in 2023, a promise it reiterated Thursday.\n\nThe latest announcement comes following backlash against Facebook over news this week that a Nebraska mother and her teenage daughter are facing multiple charges in an abortion-related case that involved law enforcement obtaining the pair’s Facebook messages, which were not encrypted. The messages, which were contained in court filings reviewed by CNN Business and are now being used to support law enforcement’s case, appear to reference abortion pills and burning “the evidence.”\n\nFacebook, in a response to the coverage, noted that the case began prior to the Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and that the search warrant it received did not mention abortion but rather “the alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant.”\n\nStill, the situation is one that many digital privacy experts have warned of, especially following Roe’s demise: that law enforcement in some states could obtain people’s personal information, such as messages, search histories and location data, from tech companies to enforce laws prohibiting abortion. Experts have encouraged people to switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms for sensitive conversations, such as those about abortions.\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone told CNN Business that Thursday’s encryption announcement has been in the works and is unrelated to news of the Nebraska case.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

She's gone from medical marvel — hers are the only known full set of octuplets to live past their first week — to national punch line for her various money-generating efforts\n\nThe 38-year-old single mother of 14 children (she had six before the octuplets) has been a porn actress, nude model, celebrity boxer and birth-control pitchwoman as she's struggled to support herself and her children. She's lost a home to foreclosure, teetered on the brink of bankruptcy and fought with nannies and others who tried to help her, leaving in her wake a string of publicists, lawyers and good-Samaritan types who no longer want to talk about her.\n\nSuleman was back in the headlines earlier this month when she was charged with welfare fraud. She pleaded not guilty and is free on her own recognizance pending a pretrial hearing next month.\n\nDespite all the attention she's generated, Suleman has kept her octuplets largely out of the public eye and shared little about them. As they turn 5, here are eight things to know about \"Octomom:\"\n\n1) BEFORE SHE WAS OCTOMOM: Suleman worked for a state mental hospital in 1999 when she said she suffered a back injury during an inmate riot. She went on to collect more than $165,000 in disability payments and used some of the money to help pay for in-vitro fertilization treatments that produced her first six children. She has a bachelor's degree in child and adolescent development from California State University, Fullerton, and was studying for a master's in counseling when she became pregnant with the octuplets.\n\n2) THE DOCTOR: All 14 of Suleman's children were born through IVF treatments provided by Beverly Hills physician Dr. Michael Kamrava. He faced harsh criticism when it was learned he implanted 12 embryos that resulted in the octuplets. Medical guidelines recommend no more than two embryos. Kamrava said he was trying to please an insistent patient. The California Medical Board revoked his license, citing gross negligence.\n\n3) NAME GAMES: Suleman picked Biblical names for all eight of her octuplets: Noah, Jonah, Jeremiah, Josiah, Isaiah, Makai, Nariyah and Maliyah. All have the same middle name, Angel. No explanation was given for why Suleman chose to spell their last names Solomon. But then no explanation was given for why she altered her own first name from Natalie to Nadya, something discovered only this month when she was charged.\n\n4) SHE SUPPORTS BIRTH CONTROL — FOR DOGS AND CATS: In 2010 People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals paid Suleman $5,000 to endorse spaying and neutering for pets. The organization also provided a month's supply of vegetarian hot dogs and hamburgers.\n\n5) CELEBRITY BOXING STAR: Suleman launched a short-lived boxing career in 2011, explaining she was stepping into the ring with a string of D-List celebrities because she was broke. Her opponents included \"Long Island Lolita\" Amy Fisher, who became famous for shooting her much older lover's wife in the face in 1992. Suleman won decisions over Fisher and a Florida bartender, but took a pounding from Philadelphia radio personality Jen Posner, though the referee ruled the bout a draw.\n\n6) ON THE MOVE: The house Suleman bought after the birth of her octuplets was put on the auction block in 2012 after she defaulted on a loan. She tried to save it by filing for bankruptcy but a judge dismissed the case when she never completed the paperwork. She has gone on to live in rental houses.\n\n7) AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS: Suleman's porn video, \"Octomom Home Alone,\" won the 2013 AVN Award for Best Celebrity Sex Tape, the adult film industry's equivalent of an Oscar.\n\n8) WHO'S THE FATHER? Suleman, who was married from 1996 to 2008, has never publicly identified the father of any of her children. She has said it wasn't her ex-husband, but a friend who donated the sperm used to create the 60 embryos that authorities say Kamrava implanted in her over the years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/24"}]}

Dominion sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021, claiming the network knowingly broadcast lies being perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his attorneys as he clung to power in the months after his 2020 election loss.\n\nThe Denver-based voting technology company said the lies caused more than $1 billion in damage and led to its employees receiving threats.\n\nLast month, presiding Judge Eric Davis ruled that it was \"crystal\" clear that allegations broadcast by Fox News and claiming that Dominion's technology was responsible for fraudulently flipping the election were false. That left it up to a jury to decide whether Fox News knew those allegations were false, which triggers legal liability.\n\n“Money is accountability and we got that today from Fox,” said Dominion lawyer Stephen Shackelford after news of the settlement.\n\nWhat was at stake in Dominion v. Fox\n\nThe settlement came hours before trial testimony that was expected to feature a parade of high-profile Fox News personalities and leaders, including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Rupert Murdoch and former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nFox had denied all wrongdoing, saying this lawsuit is an attack on the First Amendment. The legal team also argued its hosts were covering an important news story. During pretrial hearings, the legal team had taken hits – including the judge sanctioning them and telling them they had a “credibility problem.”\n\nEXPLAINER:The Fox News defamation trial begins in Delaware. Here's what you need to know\n\nThe outcome could have had major implications for misinformation and freedom of the press.\n\nLeading up to the trial, some legal experts remarked how strong of a case Dominion had. It’s uncommon for defamation cases to make it to trial and even rarer for a plaintiff to prove actual malice.\n\nDominion would have needed to prove to a Delaware jury that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing that the claims were not true.\n\nFox lawyers did not answer reporters' questions following the news of the settlement. The network, in a statement, said they \"acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\n\n\"We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nWHAT’S AHEAD:The Dominion defamation lawsuit is over. But Fox still has legal fights\n\nHow the trial ended before it began\n\nThe settlement came hours after the court completed selecting a jury and minutes before attorneys were to deliver their opening statements after a lunch break Tuesday.\n\nBut the jury was never brought into the courtroom, and those arguments never happened.\n\nInstead, the judge never took the bench. Over the subsequent three-hour delay, attorneys came and went from the backroom as a small army of media reporters speculated what was the cause of the delay. Eventually, Davis, the judge, reentered the courtroom, summoned the jury and announced the case had been settled.\n\nHe thanked jurors for their service and attorneys for their work.\n\nWhile the settlement avoids what was expected to be a six-week trial proceeding, it comes after years of litigation that featured a steady drip of embarrassing revelations derived from depositions, as well as evidence that included text messages and emails sent by Fox News personalities and leadership.\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks. Davis rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case and sanctioned its legal team for withholding evidence, including recordings of a former Fox producer that involved Trump associates.\n\nAnd there are still more lawsuits pending.\n\nDominion has sued One American News Network and Newsmax. Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, all Trump associates, have been slapped with defamation lawsuits. Fox is also facing a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, a voting machine company, that has made similar allegations to Dominion’s.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/18/fox-news-trial-delaware-live-updates-dominion-voting-election/70115075007/", "title": "Live updates: Settlement reached in Fox News defamation case ...", "text": "Two hours after Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News was to start came word from the courtroom that the parties had settled their dispute.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nThe trial for the blockbuster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit Dominion Voting Systems has waged against Fox News and its parent company was set to begin today.\n\nOpening statements were slated to start at the New Castle County courthouse after jury selection is completed. At the conclusion of this six-week trial, 12 Delawareans will decide the outcome of one of the highest-profile defamation lawsuits in decades.\n\nThe trial was originally set to begin Monday morning, but the judge announced late Sunday night that it was being pushed to Tuesday. While Judge Eric Davis did not give a reason for the delay, media outlets reported that settlement talks are ongoing on Monday.\n\nSettlement:Fox News, Dominion reach $787.5M settlement just before defamation trial was set to begin\n\n“I can't think of another one that has been as consequential in recent history,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It clearly ranks as one of the most important, partly because of who the players are.”\n\nNo need for on-air apology\n\nNew York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg claims Fox News does not have to apologize on air to Dominion as part of the settlement agreement.\n\nFox News statement\n\nFox News issued a statement saying they were \"pleased to have reached a settlement\" in their two-year \"dispute\" with Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nThe three-paragraph statement also said they \"acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"\n\n$787.5 million settlement\n\nWhile Dominion Voting Systems was looking for a $1.6 billion in damages, they received just under half of that according to their lawyers.\n\n\"The truth matters,\" Dominion Lawyer Justin Nelson said outside the courthouse Tuesday after a settlement was announced. \"Lies have consequences.\"\n\nThe settlement means the Delaware jurors selected for this case will not get to hear testimony from many high-profile Fox News personalities and executives, including Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.\n\nSettlement reached before opening arguments began\n\nTwo hours after Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News was to start came word that the parties had settled their dispute.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nJudge in the room\n\nMore than two hours after opening statements were set to start, Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has entered the courtroom. But not before speculation grew as reporters waited for word of what has been stalling the start of Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nOpening statements were supposed to start at 1:30 p.m., but no word from Davis on what’s causing the delay.\n\nReporters have been tweeting how unusual it is for a judge to not tell the courtroom what's going on. Some are even writing about it.\n\nBritain’s The Independent is calling the delay a “mystery” in its heading.\n\nReuters is reporting that a reason has not been provided for the delays, “but two sources previously told Reuters that Fox and Dominion had been holding last-minute settlement talks.”\n\nThe New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg is reporting the courtroom scene as “it is sweltering, everyone is up from their seats, going in and out of the room. Fox’s lead lawyer, Dan Webb, has taken several phone calls. Some people are standing, all are talking, others gesticulating. It's relative anarchy for Judge Davis’s court.”\n\nHe also said legal experts in the room told him “this delay is a highly unusual development just minutes before opening statements were set to begin.”\n\nJudge authorizes special master\n\nHeading into trial, Fox has already experienced several setbacks — and according to ABC News, it looks like they were handed another ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled opening statements.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis had already rejected Fox’s motion to throw out the case, ruling in favor of Dominion that the claims Fox aired about the company were indeed false. Newsworthiness, the judge ruled, is not a defense for defamation.\n\nDavis, during pretrial hearings, also sanctioned Fox’s legal team for withholding evidence, including recordings of a former Fox producer that involved Trump associates.\n\nOn Tuesday, just before opening statements were scheduled to start, Davis authorized an investigation into this issue to see if Fox needs to be sanctioned even further, ABC News reported. Davis last week reprimanded Fox’s lawyers, telling them they have a “credibility problem” and questioned if he could trust what they told him. A Fox lawyer formally apologized to the court last week.\n\nMore:Fox News sanctioned by Delaware judge for withholding evidence in $1.6B defamation trial\n\nABC News is reporting that the order is calling for an investigation by the special master that will \"include a determination\" of whether Fox News and Fox Corp \"complied with their discovery obligations.\"\n\nThe special master, who was previously appointed to oversee discovery in the case, is now \"further authorized and empowered\" to look into multiple declarations made by Fox attorneys in the case, ABC News is reporting the order as saying.\n\nStill waiting\n\nAs of 2:45 p.m., opening statements had yet to begin despite being set for 1:30 p.m.\n\nNo reason has been given for why there is a delay.\n\nInside the courtroom, attorneys for both sides are sitting looking fairly relaxed as media reporters go around asking each other if they know what is going on.\n\nThe judge, who is not in the courtroom, previously said 4:30 p.m. was going to be a hard stop time.\n\nDominion lawyers said they would need 75 minutes for their opening statements, while attorneys for Fox News said they would need 90 minutes for their opening statements.\n\nMore:Dominion Voting sues Fox for $1.6 billion over false 2020 election fraud claims\n\nOpening statements scheduled for this afternoon\n\nOpening statements in the long-awaited Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox News are scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis met with two representatives from counsel for a sidebar before breaking for lunch a little after noon.\n\nDominion Voting Systems filed its $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News in 2021, claiming the cable news network \"broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies\" implicating the election software company in an unfounded conspiracy to steal the presidential election.\n\nMore:Jan. 6 insurrection not relevant in Fox defamation trial, Delaware judge rules\n\nDominion asserts that Fox News intentionally aired false allegations that its software rigged the election against former President Donald Trump \"because the lies were good for Fox's business.\" Dominion said the network was trying to lure back viewers who were angered when the network called the Nov. 3 election for Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n\nThe company said the legal action follows repeated demands for retractions, adding that \"Fox producers, content managers, and hosts were notified more than 30 times that their smears were not true.\"\n\nStern warning from judge after photo taken in courtroom\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis said someone was found taking a photo in the courtroom just before proceedings started Tuesday morning. Photography is not allowed in Delaware courtrooms.\n\nThe person is a \"party,\" the judge said, but he did not give more detail.\n\nWashington Post media critic Erik Wemple said Caley Cronin, a public relations representative for Fox News, was summoned from Davis' courtroom and directed to the overflow room for having taken a photograph in the courtroom.\n\nThe photo was deleted from the person's phone, Davis said. Ha also gave a stern warning to people in the courtroom, many of whom are reporters, to not take photos or connect to the Internet while in the courtroom.\n\nThis is the most access any Superior Court trial has ever had, Davis said.\n\n“It’s not a joke,” he said.\n\nMore:Judge in Dominion lawsuit sanctions Fox News, questions truthfulness of network's lawyers\n\n'Fight human nature,' judge tells jurors and alternates\n\nThe jury and alternates, who will hear what's expected to be a weeks-long Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox News were chosen just after 11 a.m.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Eric Davis gave initial instructions to the 24 Delawareans, urging them to \"fight human nature\" and not discuss this case with the other jurors until deliberations — as well as with family and friends.\n\nHe also warned the jurors from doing \"any detective work.\" They must limit themselves to the evidence presented in the courtroom.\n\nMore:Dominion Voting sues Fox for $1.6 billion over false 2020 election fraud claims\n\nFollowing Davis' words to the jury came a quick break. After that, the judge will hear lawyer objections on opening presentations and then opening arguments will begin.\n\nGet a glimpse of what's happening outside Wilmington courthouse\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal photographers have been outside the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center capturing what’s going on as the Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox News gets ready to start.\n\nMore:Judge in Dominion lawsuit sanctions Fox News, questions truthfulness of network's lawyers\n\nHere are some of the images outside Wilmington’s 500 N. King St.\n\nJury selected, alternates now being picked\n\nThe 12 jurors expected to hear the Fox News defamation trial have been chosen and now a dozen alternates are being determined.\n\nDelaware jurors will decide if Fox committed \"actual malice,\" or the idea that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing the claims were not true.\n\nMore:Fox News anchors may take the stand in Delaware, but you can't watch it live. Here's why\n\nThe trial is expected to last six weeks.\n\nWhat's happening outside the courthouse\n\nA school bus filled with children drove past the courthouse. The children, who looked elementary or middle school-aged, yelled out the window at all the media lined up outside the courthouse. The kids laughed and stuck their tongues out, clearly excited about the commotion.\n\nWill Kenkel, a local, stood outside the Wilmington courthouse with a sign that read “Tucker Carlson, ditch the fascistic, stick w/ fish sticks.\"\n\nKenkel, who made the sign himself, said the slogan was prompted by his wife, who couldn't tell if he was saying \"fascistic\" or \"fish sticks.\"\n\nWhile Kenkel didn't mention Carlson's family fortune, the TV host's father married the heiress to Swanson frozen foods when Carlson was 10. The frozen food empire is well known for its fish sticks.\n\nKenkel said he was a little bit worried Monday when they delayed the trial, joking that if they settled, his knee pain from making the sign was going to be for naught.\n\nHe added that he plans to protest throughout the weeks-long trial.\n\nMore:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Tuesday\n\n“I’ve just been dismayed for a long time about all the mistruths and selective coverage on Fox,” he said. “There’s just some sense of justice after finally getting called out on it and taken to court, and hopefully made to pay for their broadcasting known falsehoods.”\n\nA third protester showed up around 9 a.m., wearing a shirt that said Make America Kind Again. He held a small sign that said, in all capital letters, \"Fox + GOP = fascist propaganda.\"\n\nObjections to opening statements\n\nThe final part of jury selection has officially started.\n\nJust before, lawyers for each side indicated they have objections to each other's opening statement slides. Fox lawyer Dan Webb said Dominion is \"objecting to huge amounts\" and that it would \"cripple\" their argument.\n\nFox has also objected to a significant portion of Dominion's presentation, he said.\n\nFinal stage of jury selection kicks off Tuesday\n\nThe final stages of jury selection started at 9 a.m., with opening statements starting shortly after.\n\nThese 12 Delaware jurors will have to decide if Fox committed “actual malice,” or the idea that Fox knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing the claims were not true.\n\nLast week, Delaware Superior Court summoned more than 1,000 people, who were asked a series of questions about their media consumption and if they worked at polling places, among others.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:Delaware residents will decide outcome of Fox News defamation case. Trial to begin Monday\n\nIn the course of the upcoming six weeks, a dozen jurors will hear the evidence with 12 alternates, who will fill in if jurors have to drop out due to sickness or other circumstances.\n\nWaiting for the trial to start\n\nReporters began lining up outside of a Leonard L. Williams Justice Center courtroom before 7 a.m. when the room opened an hour later.Reporters have two options to watch the trial: They can watch from the courtroom or via a livestream in a neighboring courtroom – both on the seventh floor.\n\nOutside the Wilmington courthouse, media largely swarmed the area. But one man held a handmade sign saying, “Make Them Pay” and “Fox is guilty.”\n\nThe man appeared to focus on a group of well-dressed people, though it’s unclear what their role in the trial is. One man in a suit and two women stood in the group chatting. As the news cameras gathered around them to take a photo of the protester, they would move.\n\nMobile billboards\n\nTwo mobile billboard trucks trolling Fox News have been circling the area near Wilmington’s Leonard L. Williams Justice Center, where the Fox News defamation trial is scheduled to start.\n\nThe mobile billboards, commissioned by left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters for America, have messages reading “Fox News Lied,” “Lachlan Murdoch Knew,” “Rupert Murdoch Knew,” “Tucker Carlson Knew,” “They All Knew,” “FoxKnew.com”\n\nThe billboards highlight that Fox News knew the election fraud claims Trump’s team was pushing in 2020 were lies and promoted them anyway, according to a statement by Media Matters for America. The billboards specifically call out Fox Corp.'s chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who are scheduled to testify at the trial.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., the trucks moved from their spot on King Street and began driving down the road, turning onto Fourth Street as they circled the courthouse. As they drove by a DART bus stop, one man looked at them and smiled, saying “wow, wow.”\n\n“That’s wild, isn't it?” he said.\n\nWhat to expect at the trial and what's at stake\n\nDozens of journalists are expected to flock to Delaware to cover the trial. This case will also likely be one of the most significant trials The First State has ever hosted. Judge Eric Davis has prohibited any use of cameras in the courtroom or publishing audio recordings.\n\nDominion filed a lawsuit against Fox in 2021 after the cable news network aired false claims about Dominion, specifically that it helped rig the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJurors will have the task of determining if Fox committed “actual malice,” or the idea that it knowingly published false information about Dominion or recklessly disregarded information showing that the claims were not true.\n\nDominion claims Fox knowingly spread falsehoods to pander to its conservative base of customers.\n\nFox has denied all wrongdoing, saying its hosts were covering the most important news story of the day. Fox News released a statement days before trial that described the lawsuit to be a “political crusade in search of a financial windfall.”\n\nMany Fox hosts are expected to testify during the course of the trial, including Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. It’s expected that Fox chairman and media mogul Rupert Murdoch will also testify.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT:Fox News sanctioned by Delaware judge for withholding evidence in $1.6B defamation trial", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/04/19/stephen-colbert-late-night-hosts-react-fox-news-dominion-settlement/11694566002/", "title": "Stephen Colbert says Fox News-Dominion settlement 'does nothing ...", "text": "Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and more late-night hosts had a field day after Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million in a settlement reached Tuesday.\n\nDominion sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for $1.6 billion, claiming the network knowingly broadcast lies being perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his attorneys to undercut public confidence in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn \"The Late Show,\" Colbert voiced disappointment of Fox News averting trial because it was \"supposed to provide me six weeks of delicious content.\"\n\n\"I wanted to see Rupert Murdoch put his hand on the Bible and burst into flames,\" he quipped.\n\n'SNL' roasts 'Fox & Friends,' Mike Lindell over Dominion voting lawsuit, Travis Kelce hosts\n\nColbert continued, telling the audience he had \"bad news\" because the news network reportedly \"will not have to acknowledge on air that it told lies about Dominion in the wake of the 2020 election.\" That quickly prompted booing from the audience.\n\n\"I guess it’s satisfying.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 19th of April 2023. Today, Fox News reaches a settlement with Dominion. Plus, a look at the man working to free Americans detained abroad, and states are cutting Medicaid as the COVID-19 public health emergency ends.\n\n♦\n\nFox News has agreed to settle the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed against the network for its broadcast of lies aimed at weakening public confidence in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Fox News and Dominion voting systems agreed to a $787.5 million settlement yesterday. Dominion sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021. Dominion claimed that the network knowingly broadcast lies perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his attorneys as he clung to power in the months after his election loss. The voting technology company said the lies caused more than a billion dollars in damage and led to threats toward its employees. The settlement came hours before trial testimony was set to begin. High profile Fox News personalities and executives were set to testify, including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Rupert Murdoch. Fox had denied all wrongdoing, calling the lawsuit an attack on the First Amendment.\n\n♦\n\nThe Undersecretary of Thugs. That's how some refer to Bill Richardson. He was once the governor of New Mexico, among other things. But his main focus for years has centered on freeing Americans detained abroad. I spoke with USA TODAY National Correspondent Chris Kenning to learn more. Hello Chris, welcome to 5 Things.\n\nChris Kenning:\n\nHello, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for coming on. So before we get to Bill Richardson, I want to just start by asking what has historically been the process to free Americans detained abroad?\n\nChris Kenning:\n\nHostage taking is often associated with a terrorist or criminal seeking a ransom. But many Americans are also held by foreign states under what the US considers unjust charges, including for political reasons. So the way the US handles those types of cases really changed in 2015, following the killings of journalists, James Foley and other ISIS hostages in Syria. The Obama administration created the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as well as a hostage recovery team led by the FBI. And it was all part of an attempt to better prioritize and organize the efforts to return wrongful detainees and hostages.\n\nThat's led to a number of over the years, prisoner swaps, rescues, negotiated returns. But the problem is still out there by one count, there's at least 54 US citizens or permanent residents that are now held hostage or wrongfully detained in 15 countries roughly. Those are just the cases that are publicly disclosed. The real figure is thought to be higher. Last year, President Biden declared hostage taking and wrongful detention an emergency and added some new tools, including financial sanctions and visa bans that they could employ. But some hostage advocates and family members still feel like the cases languish too long and they sometimes turn to seek additional help outside of the government. And that can include private parties such as the Richardson Center.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So Chris, how did Bill Richardson become this really go-to guy to call for these negotiations?\n\nChris Kenning:\n\nWell, it happened by accident as he tells it. It was 1994 and Richardson was a congressman then, and he was in North Korea to discuss nuclear issues as part of a trip. And while he was there, a US Army helicopter was shot down after it veered off course into the demilitarized zone. And so suddenly he was thrust into this role as a negotiator and was told, \"Don't come home without the Americans.\" He stayed and won the release of the one captive and the other soldier who had died.\n\nFollowing that, there were a number of similar stories that built his reputation as the go-to negotiator for wresting prisoners from dictators and terrorists and hostile regimes. He had sat down with Saddam Hussein all the way to Sudanese rebels to try to get folks home. And earned this moniker as the Undersecretary of Thugs, given the folks he was dealing with. In '96, he was appointed as the US Ambassador to the UN under President Clinton and made some key contacts there. In 2011, he started the Richardson Center for Global Engagement. And one of their big efforts is to work to return captive Americans.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMaybe the most high profile case right now of an American detained abroad, is journalist Evan Gershkovich, who's currently being held in Russia. And we heard that he was denied bail this week. Is Bill Richardson involved with his possible release? And what's the latest there?\n\nChris Kenning:\n\nMickey Bergman, who is the Richardson Center and Richardson's right-hand man, told us that they were not contacted by the family to jump in and help, but they stood ready to do so. As you know, this is a big deal, the first US correspondent since the Cold War to be detained in Russia on spying allegations. Top Russian diplomats said that Russia might be willing to discuss a potential prisoner swap. He noted that they have a channel that they've used in the past with the US government to talk about that, but he noted that any discussion with the US would happen only after the trial. That means an exchange is probably not going to happen for some time, unfortunately. Wouldn't be surprising if Richardson did wind up playing some kind of role eventually. Diane Foley, whose son was one of the hostages killed in Syria and now runs a foundation to support families of hostages and detainees, said it's often the case that both government and private efforts are needed for these cases to resolve.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nUSA TODAY National Correspondent Chris Kenning. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Kenning:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFour Americans and three Russians have been charged with conspiring to spread discord in US society, spread Russian propaganda and interfere illegally in US elections. The Americans and two Russians were added to an existing case in Florida involving Alexander Ionov. Prosecutors have described him as the founder of a Moscow-based organization funded by the Russian government to carry out a secretive influence campaign in the US. Prosecutors say the group recruited US-based organizations to help sway elections and make it appear that there was strong support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, among other things. The four Americans are all part of the African People Socialist Party. The group previously denied working covertly for Russia.\n\n♦\n\nThe end to the COVID-19 public health emergency means massive Medicaid cuts are coming. USA TODAY Health Reporter Ken Alltucker explains. Ken, thanks for hopping on the podcast today.\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nHi, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nStates have begun these widespread Medicaid cuts. How many people are affected here and why is this happening?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nThis started at the beginning of the pandemic when the federal government decided it would be a good idea for people to have health insurance when COVID-19 first emerged. And at that time, the decision was made to stop disenrollments for people on Medicaid, which is the government program for low income families and the disabled. So at that time, the federal government told states, \"Look, you could sign people up for Medicaid, but we don't want you to disenroll them unless they request it or there's a change, like somebody left the state or passed away.\" So from that point forward, from March 2020, the signups for Medicaid increased substantially. And now the federal government estimates roughly about 15 million people are getting Medicaid coverage who might not qualify any longer. And essentially what they're saying, is that states are now allowed to begin these enrollment cuts, because the public health emergency is over and that's what states are doing.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Ken, why are advocates so concerned about these cuts?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nPeople on Medicaid, they tend to be more vulnerable populations. These are low income families or they're disabled people who rely on Medicaid to take care of themselves, to get their medicines or to get their treatments and their doctor's visits, as well as in-person help in some cases. So essentially, what they're worried about is the state agencies have never really tried to determine this level of cut, roughly 15 million people at once. And they think it will be a paperwork nightmare, where a lot of people will be rightly identified as no longer qualifying for Medicaid, but some people will be cut who probably still are eligible for Medicaid. And it becomes a very difficult situation for them as well as the states.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKen, you write about this avalanche of paperwork that's underway. You've touched on this a bit, but what are the concerns specifically here?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nMedicaid is an income based program, so you have to have a low income to qualify for it, and different states have different levels of income thresholds. So what happens is, the states have to go through this massive verification, where they ask for things like pay stubs. And so they're asking people for these documents, but a lot of folks on Medicaid might not have the most stable housing situation. So their house as of March 2020 when the pandemic started, could be six or seven addresses ago and they might not get the paperwork that they need. So some advocates fear that people who still do qualify for this will get cut. And in those cases they'll miss out on their healthcare. And for example, I profiled a woman in Arkansas who has diabetes and high blood pressure. She learned that she's being cut from Medicaid in Arkansas. And if you don't take care of those chronic conditions, they could become a lot more serious. It could result in a hospital stay and something that's a lot more expensive than filling a prescription.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what options do people have if their Medicaid coverage is cut?\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nThere's the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which offers subsidized coverage.

Thanks as always.\n\nKen Alltucker:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMany of us couldn't look away from Fyre Festival.\n\nHulu documentary Fyre Fraud:\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSocial media watched the festival's disaster happen in real time. And there were not one but two documentaries on Netflix and Hulu respectively, that went behind the scenes. Now the festival's founder, Billy McFarland, says Fyre Fest is happening again. That's even after acknowledging he defrauded investors of $26 million in the 2017 failure. So why do people want to see him try again? Elizabeth Cohen, a West Virginia University professor who researches psychology of media and pop culture said a theory called social comparison is behind it. That posits humans will always try and compare themselves to others to figure out where they fit in the world. And other experts say we simply can't look away, because of schadenfreude or finding joy in others' hardships.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

Fox News had just agreed to an 11th-hour settlement with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in a defamation case soon after the jury had been seated.\n\nFox News issued a statement that said, in part, “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\n\nThat in itself that is stunning enough (“stunning” was a word thrown around Tuesday like an election lie at a Rudy Giuliani press conference), even if it was just stating the obvious. But that wasn’t what cracked Tapper up.\n\n“I’m sorry, this is going to be difficult to say with a straight face,” he said. “‘This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitments to the highest journalist standards.’”\n\nWasted time:Why the '60 Minutes' interview of Marjorie Taylor Greene was dangerous\n\nFox settles with Dominion, which sought $1.6 billion for defamation\n\nStandards? We don’t need no stinkin’ standards.\n\nThat was the implication, certainly, not just in the statement, but more obviously in the long lead-up to the trial, in which internal messages and emails revealed that some of Fox News’ most-popular personalities, panicked about losing ratings, pushed absurd conspiracy theories that claimed Donald Trump had won the 2020 election when they knew he hadn’t.\n\nSome of those theories involved Dominion, which sued Fox News for $1.6 billion in damage, and more in punitive damages.\n\nThe settlement Tuesday didn’t catch networks off-guard, exactly, but it was surprising. And, to be honest, disappointing in some regard. The idea of Rupert Murdoch and Tucker Carlson on the stand under oath is pretty intriguing, you have to admit.\n\nOr at least Andrew Weissmann, a legal analyst on MSBNC, did. Weissmann said it was disappointing that Fox News executives and stars wouldn’t have to acknowledge in person that they knowingly pushed lies, and wouldn't have to apologize for them.\n\n“I think all of us are feeling sort of schadenfreude, wanted to have it repeated and have them feel the pain of having to say it from their own mouths,” he said. “Like a child, you want to hear them say, ‘I’m sorry.’”\n\nWhat does the Trump indictment mean?Fox News can't decide if it's 'history' or 'BS'\n\nLoyal Fox News fans likely won't care about the settlement, and they wouldn't have cared about a verdict\n\nThere’s a lot of truth in that. Part of the Tucker Carlson-Sean Hannity-Laura Ingraham way of doing business is to maximize smugness, like they’re the ones who really know what’s what and anyone who disagrees is a dolt. To see and hear them squirm would have been satisfying, no doubt. (Not that we would have seen them — the judge wouldn’t allow cameras in the courtroom.)\n\nThe settlement is obviously bad for Fox News, though not as bad as it could have been financially. The acknowledgment is worse. Whatever might have happened in the courtroom had the case played out, the damage to the reputation of Fox News is done.\n\nAnd it won’t matter a bit.\n\nNot to the loyal Fox News viewers who get their information from the network and nowhere else. (Fox News reported the settlement, briefly, while CNN and MSNBC went all out with coverage.)\n\nMany of them believe the election lies, the conspiracy theories and whatnot. They aren’t looking to the network to learn what is happening in the world. They’re looking to have their biases and preexisting ideas confirmed. Which is exactly what the cynical bunch at Fox News worked to do in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nIt started with Arizona, naturally, when Fox News correctly called the state for Joe Biden on election night before anyone else. This enraged Trump (add it to the list), and in the ensuing days and weeks even-farther-right networks like One America News Network and Newsmax began gaining some ratings traction. Fox News ratings, meanwhile, dipped.\n\nThe messages and emails show that the network panicked. There was talk that in the future Fox News shouldn’t just consider numbers when making projections. What about the feelings of their viewers?\n\nWhat about them?\n\nPart of reporting the truth is having people mad at you. It’s called journalism.\n\n'Nefarious' review:Glenn Beck's cameo is the real horror\n\nFacts are bad for business at Fox News\n\nA Fox News reporter, Jacqui Heinrich, dared to fact-check a Trump tweet and said there was no evidence of fraud on Dominion’s part.\n\n“Please get her fired,” Carlson texted to Hannity and Ingraham. Also: “It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.”\n\nIt gets worse. When former Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher fact-checked a press conference by Giuliani and fellow Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott complained in an email that “I can’t keep defending these reporters who don’t understand our viewers and how to handle stories.”\n\nFisher now works for CNN.\n\nThese are the most-damaging revelations. Fox News has for years tried to prop up the often-irresponsible claims and misrepresentations of its prime-time hosts by pointing to its news division. But what good is having one if your most-popular hosts and even your CEO are acting like this?\n\nThe settlement doesn’t mean Fox News is in the clear. There are other defendants, and Smartmatic, another election technology company, has filed a $2.7 billion defamation suit against the network.\n\nBut the settlement did end this chapter, one that Tapper correctly described as “one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism.”\n\nNow that is accuracy.\n\nDangerous precedent:How national media turned Kari Lake into Trumpism's 'leading lady'\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

No reason was given, but the network recently settled a lawsuit Dominion Voting Systems brought against it for $787.5 million. It was revealed in documents that Carlson, along with other Fox News hosts, said things on air that he personally did not believe, some of which related to the 2020 election and Donald Trump’s claims of fraud.\n\nWhat is Tucker Carlson’s net worth?\n\nEstimates vary widely, but Carlson’s net worth is reportedly ranges from $30 million to as much as $370 million.\n\nWhat was Tucker Carlson’s salary?\n\nEstimates of Carlson’s salary at Fox News also vary, with reports ranging from $5 million annually to $15-$20 million a year, according to Forbes.\n\nLemon twist:CNN fires Don Lemon via his agent: 'I am stunned,' he tweets", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/25/biden-2024-tucker-carlson-fox-news-don-lemon-ukraine-china-sudan-trump-gender-transgender/11733295002/", "title": "Biden reelection announcement, Tucker Carlson, Fox News, Sudan ...", "text": "President Joe Biden timed his announcement of his 2024 reelection campaign with the four-year anniversary of his entry into the 2020 presidential race.

His last show was Friday, the company announced in a news release Monday.\n\nThe move comes a week after a nine-figure settlement by the company in a lawsuit related to the 2020 presidential election. Carlson, who did not release a public statement about his departure before press time, had become a leading voice on television spreading far-right viewpoints.\n\nNetwork spokespersons didn't respond to a request to elaborate on the reasons for Carlson's departure, but it quickly followed last week's $787.5 million payment Fox agreed to make to settle a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nto elaborate on the reasons for Carlson's departure, but it quickly followed last week's $787.5 million payment Fox agreed to make to settle a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the deal late Monday. But as rescue operations waged by the United States and European nations use the gap to bring diplomats and others to safety, the Sudanese are bracing for more intense fighting. Once diplomats and others are evacuated, the “warring parties will not heed any calls for a truce or a cease-fire,” one analyst said.

Jean Carroll's claim that Trump raped her nearly three decades ago in a department store dressing room. He denies it. The trial is in a federal civil court, meaning that no matter the outcome, Trump isn't in danger of going to jail. He isn't required to be in court, either, and his lawyers have indicated he most likely won't testify. But the trial, which comes as Trump is again running for president, still has the potential to be politically damaging for the Republican.

Zooey Zephyr hasn’t officially been censured yet. But Montana House Speaker Matt Regier is expected to continue not allowing Zephyr to speak on the chamber's floor unless she apologizes. Zephyr, the first openly transgender woman elected to Montana's legislature, says she is standing by comments she made last week as the state’s House debated a bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Zephyr criticized the bill and its supporters, referencing the group’s opening prayer: “I hope the next time there’s an invocation, when you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands.\" Republican lawmakers called for her censure in response.

But its “non-violent stunts rely on a committed, coordinated hardcore”, with donors including the Climate Emergency Fund, “a non-profit backed by oil heiress Aileen Getty”.\n\nThey believe that transitioning away from fossil fuels will “help cut energy bills and help us meet our international climate obligations”, said the Evening Standard . “Allowing the extraction of new oil and gas resources in the UK is an obscene, genocidal policy that will kill our children and condemn humanity to oblivion.”\n\nMembers operate in “autonomous blocs with shared resources” but there is no formal leadership, with the majority of the group’s funding coming from donations. Their goal is to raise awareness of the effects the oil industry has on climate change “on a massive scale”.\n\nOne activist described the group to The Observer as “a non-hierarchical coalition of organisers, scientists, lawyers and former workers in the oil industry who collaborate on both demands and tactics”.\n\nJust Stop Oil is a youth-led offshoot of Extinction Rebellion and other climate protest organisations. It emerged in February 2022, and calls for the UK government to halt all new fossil fuel projects to combat climate change .\n\nJust Stop Oil has confirmed to The Independent that it is one of the organisations attending, and remains “committed to disrupting sporting and cultural events”.\n\nExtinction Rebellion , Just Stop Oil’s ancestor group, has agreed to guard the marathon from protesters in a “unique” deal revealed by event director Hugh Brasher, to protect one of “the crown jewels” of sport, according to BBC News .\n\nOrganisers of the London Marathon have been placed on high alert as nearly 30,000 “eco-zealots from more than 200 organisations will descend on the capital”, said the Daily Mail , for a four-day protest named “The Big One”.\n\nThe planned protest, just days after 118 animal rights activists were arrested for disrupting the Grand National, will “raise concerns across sport of copycat incidents in the weeks ahead”, said The Guardian .\n\nThe London Marathon is braced for disruption from Just Stop Oil after an activist from the protest group covered one of the tables at the World Snooker Championship with orange powder earlier this week.\n\nMore than 2,000 protesters have been arrested since the group started taking action in April last year, with police making 755 arrests in October and November alone.\n\nAims\n\nTheir goal is to raise awareness of the effects the oil industry has on climate change “on a massive scale”. One activist told The Guardian the group is able to mobilise “upwards of 1,000 people” and is employing tactics that are a “fusion of other large-scale blockade-style actions you have seen in the past”.\n\nAs the name suggests, the group demands an immediate end to all new fossil fuel supply projects, and is urging the government to “make a statement that it will immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK”.\n\nThey believe that transitioning away from fossil fuels will “help cut energy bills and help us meet our international climate obligations”, said the Evening Standard.\n\n“Allowing the extraction of new oil and gas resources in the UK is an obscene, genocidal policy that will kill our children and condemn humanity to oblivion. It just has to stop.”\n\nGroup tactics\n\nTheir tactics include “glueing themselves to the road and attaching themselves to fuel tankers with bike locks”, said Sky News. Activists have begun targeting art galleries, throwing soup at Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers and glueing themselves to a John Constable painting in London’s National Gallery last year.\n\nSupporters of the group began blocking roads and bridges across London last autumn, causing severe disruption by blocking the M25, the country’s busiest motorway, in November.\n\nAnother “popular method of protest” has been to tie themselves to goalposts at Premier League football matches, said the Daily Mail, with one protester tying himself to a post by his neck.\n\nThey caused “chaos” at last summer’s British Grand Prix, said The Telegraph’s chief sports writer, Oliver Brown, invading the Silverstone track on the opening lap, “risking death both to themselves and the drivers”.\n\n“What’s striking”, said the FT, is that protesters’ tactics are “milder than those used by the suffragettes”. But like the suffragettes in their time, “climate protesters are not loved” by the British public.\n\nYouGov survey results published on Tuesday indicated that 36% of UK adults had a “very unfavourable view” of Just Stop Oil, compared with 12% somewhat favourable and only 4% very favourable.\n\nLast April, the group released the results of a YouGov survey commissioned by Social Change Lab saying that more than half (58%) of UK adults supported a ban on new oil and gas projects. But polling this February showed nearly three-quarters of the public thought protests rarely, if ever, made a difference.\n\nResponse\n\nA myriad of legal measures have been introduced in the past year with the aim of curbing public protest. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which came into effect in April, gives police the right to restrict protests if they believe one could cause public disorder.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman urged peers to back “proper penalties” for disruptive protesters in proposed amendments to the Public Order Bill, which would allow officers to shut down protests before they became “highly disruptive”.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement that at this weekend’s protest “people can expect a visible, engaging but firm policing presence to tackle any criminal or anti-social behaviour and disorder”.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has called for protesters to be given longer prison sentences, saying that Just Stop Oil activists were “wrong” and “arrogant”. The Labour Party has accepted more than £350,000 donations from Dale Vince, a key backer of Just Stop Oil, since the last election.\n\nNext moves\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was drawing up powers for police to stop “go-slow” actions, such as walking protests, adopted by Just Stop Oil after government laws were introduced to block “pop-up” demonstrations.\n\nThe proposals would prevent “a small minority” from disrupting the lives of the “hard-working majority”, he said. Sunak wrote on the ConservativeHome website that disruptive protests were “not right and we’re going to put a stop to it”.\n\nThe protesters have said they will continue taking action until a ban on all new fossil fuel projects is agreed by the government.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/07/05/uk-climate-change-protesters-glued-da-vinci-last-supper-copy/7815978001/", "title": "Anti-oil climate activists glued to \"Last Supper\" painting copy in UK", "text": "Associated Press\n\nLONDON– Climate change protesters targeted a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\" at London's Royal Academy of Arts on Tuesday, gluing themselves to the painting's frame and spray-painting \"No New Oil\" next to it.\n\nThe protest, organized by supporters of the campaign group Just Stop Oil, came a day after two activists from the group were arrested after gluing themselves to the frame of John Constable's \"The Hay Wain\" in London's National Gallery.\n\nOn Tuesday, five activists entered the Royal Academy and attached a hand each to the frame of \"The Last Supper,\" a full-size copy of da Vinci's famous 15th-century work.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said three men and two women were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

Please don’t jump onto our race circuits to protest, we don’t want to put you in harm’s way.”\n\nHamilton waves at fans following the British Grand Prix.

It is incredibly disappointing that anyone would make the decision to do this,” he said.\n\n“Thankfully we had plans in place for an eventuality such as this and the group were swiftly removed and arrested by our officers.”\n\nJust Stop Oil posted a statement on social media after the race claiming responsibility for incident and outlining its reasons for doing so.\n\n“If you are more outraged about this disruption than our world being burnt before our eyes, then you need to get your priorities straight,” the post said.\n\nBoth race winner Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez, who finished second, said they backed the cause, but criticized the way the protest was carried out.\n\n“I think people have the opportunity to speak out and do manifestations wherever they want, because it’s a right. I just don’t believe jumping into a Formula 1 track is the best way to do it, and putting yourself at risk and all the other drivers,” Ferrari driver Sainz, who claimed his maiden victory, said in the post-race press conference.\n\n“So yes, I support the cause, I think Formula 1 is doing a great job already to try and go carbon zero by 2030. And we are pushing on this area and we are pushing F1 and pushing the FIA [motorsport’s governing body] to find ways to go in this direction.”\n\nStefano Domenicali, F1’s chief executive, called the protestors actions “irresponsible and dangerous.”\n\n“Everyone has the right to speak out on issues, but no one has the right to put lives in danger,” he told reporters. “The actions of a small group of people today were completely irresponsible and dangerous.\n\n“We thank the police for their great work and we shouldn’t be complacent about the risk this posed to the safety of the drivers, marshals, fans and the individuals themselves.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.

Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nCNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/world/cop27-egypt-agreement-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "COP27: Summit agrees to help climate victims. But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/media/uk-journalist-arrests-climate-protest/index.html", "title": "UK police arrest journalists covering a climate protest | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nUK police arrested and detained three journalists covering a climate protest earlier this week, raising concerns that the country’s press freedoms are under threat.\n\nPolice officers in Hertfordshire, a county in southern England, arrested LBC radio reporter Charlotte Lynch on Tuesday on a bridge over a public highway near London as she covered nearby protests by climate group Just Stop Oil.\n\nIn an interview with LBC on Thursday, Hertfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner David Lloyd admitted that police “got it wrong” for arresting Lynch, adding that arresting journalists “doesn’t sound right.”\n\nIn a series of Twitter posts, Lynch said that, despite showing police her press credentials, they handcuffed her “almost immediately.” Police confiscated her phone and searched her twice before holding her in a cell for five hours without questioning, she said.\n\n“It was absolutely terrifying being in a cell with a pad for a bed in one corner and a metal toilet in the other. I was just doing my job,” Lynch said. “What’s also terrifying is what this means for press freedom. It was blindingly obvious I was a reporter,” she added.\n\nLynch told LBC on Wednesday that police arrested her on suspicion of “conspiracy to commit a public nuisance.” She was eventually released with no further action.\n\nThe incident came just a day after documentary filmmaker Rich Felgate and photographer Tom Bowles, also covering Just Stop Oil protests, were arrested by Hertfordshire police on a bridge.\n\nProtestors began climbing onto gantries above London’s outer highway on Monday to demand the government halt all new oil and gas projects, leading to multiple arrests of activists.\n\nBowles said in a Thursday interview with TalkTV that he and Felgate were also arrested on suspicion of “conspiracy to cause public nuisance.” Hertfordshire police told CNN Business on Thursday that both Bowles and Felgate were released with no further action.\n\nActivists from Just Stop Oil climbing a gantry on the M25 highway near London Colney in Hertfordshire.

The cards are recognized by the National Police Chief’s Council.\n\n“I’m quite obviously a member of the press, I’ve got cameras and I am in a public place,” Felgate can be heard saying in the video.\n\nPolice questioned both men while in custody, and asked Felgate for the code to access his phone, he told LBC in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nBowles said in a Tuesday tweet that three police officers arrived at his house at 11 p.m. on Monday, waking up his wife and daughter, and searched his home.

SPDC was also ordered to carry out an intensive clean-up of the damage to the communities.\n\nWilliams was on Wednesday awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for his work in holding the company accountable for the environmental damage.\n\nHe is one of seven global winners of the prestigious award, announced Wednesday morning, to honor grassroots, environmental activists. The prize is awarded each year by The Goldman Environmental Foundation, with ceremonies in San Francisco and Washington, DC.\n\n“These seven leaders give us a reason for hope and remind us what can be accomplished in the face of adversity,” the Vice President of the Goldman Environmental Foundation, Jennifer Goldman Wallis, said in a statement.\n\nWilliams attributed his win to “the grace of God” in a video call with CNN from Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nA historic case\n\nShell had argued for the case to be tried in Nigeria while rejecting liability for the spills, which it said were caused by sabotage of its subsidiary’s pipelines. In 2013, a Dutch lower court ruled that the Shell parent company could not be held responsible for violations committed by its Nigerian division.\n\nHowever, Williams says he and his legal team pushed on because they had established that the parent company in the Netherlands had “authority flow,” to the subsidiary – Shell Nigeria – and therefore could not be exempt from its decisions and operations.\n\nOil Pollution in Goi, in Ogoniland, Niger Delta area of Nigeria, 2020. Photo: George Osodi George Osodi\n\n“That was what gave us the confidence to appeal against the judgment, and the Court of Appeal agreed with us that the district court was wrong,” Williams said.\n\n“The first ruling that we got favorably was on jurisdiction. The Dutch High Court sitting in The Hague ruled that they had jurisdiction to hear the cases from Nigeria. That was the first hurdle that we scaled through,” he said.\n\nAfter the final ruling in January last year, Shell said in a statement: “We continue to believe that the spills in Oruma and Goi were the result of sabotage. We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding,” noting out that sabotage, oil theft, and illegal refining are “a major challenge” in the region.\n\nShell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Odugbesan told CNN the company had agreed a settlement with the four farmers from Goi and Oruma communities after last year’s ruling, and that representatives are “working amiably on the actualization of the judgment.”\n\nHundreds of oil spills every year\n\nShell is the largest oil operator in the Niger Delta, Africa’s largest oil-producing region. Its residents face high poverty rates and a largely degraded environment, owing to hundreds of spills every year.\n\n“We have groundwater polluted with benzene 900 times above WHO level, we have farmlands with poor yields, rivers that are barely fishable, neonatal deaths numbering thousands yearly as a result of spills. We have reduced neuroplasticity of the brain as a result of oil pollution,” Niger Delta activist Saatah Nubari told CNN.\n\nChima Williams (center) and colleagues visit an oil-polluted area in Ikebiri Southern Ijaw, an area of the Niger Delta (Photo: George Osodi) George Osodi\n\n“The Niger Delta is a graveyard of the living and we will never know how much harm has been done until we audit the entire environment,” Nubari also said.\n\nFor many years, Shell has attributed most spills to theft and sabotage by locals.\n\n“Over 95 percent of the spill incidents in our operations are caused by sabotage,” Odugbesan, the Shell Nigeria spokesman, told CNN.\n\n“Throughout our operations globally, in 2021, it’s only in Nigeria that we recorded crude theft. And this has implications on our cost. When our facilities are tampered with and there’s a spill, we spend money to stop the spill, fix our facility, clean up and remediate the environment,” Odugbesan said.\n\nOperational problems\n\nNubari believes oil companies are “untouchable in Nigeria and unaccountable and that is why communities and individuals approach foreign courts to get justice.”\n\nWilliams agrees it is difficult to hold multinational companies accountable through government agencies in Nigeria.\n\nShell Nigeria spokesman Odugbesan denied that Shell is untouchable in Nigeria and stated that the company paid out around 50 billion naira in 2021 (around $111 million as of last year) after being sued by another community.\n\nFor Williams, his lengthy David-versus-Goliath legal battle has come with highs and lows.\n\n“In 2008, I was arrested on a Shell facility when I went to expose that Shell was still flaring gas, despite a 2005 court ruling which ordered them to stop gas flaring in Iwhrekan community, in the Niger Delta,” he told CNN.\n\nWilliams lauded other court decisions that have signaled wins for the Niger Delta’s aggrieved communities.\n\n“After January 29th, there have been a lot of positive court decisions within and outside Nigeria, some with massive monetary awards.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nAs Europe tries to stymie Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine by weaning itself off Russia’s oil, Middle Eastern nations appear to be the only producers with enough capacity to compensate.\n\nThe question is, do any of them have the technical ability, and crucially, the willingness, to step up? Don’t hold your breath, say oil analysts.\n\nWestern states have imposed a host of sanctions to punish Russia for its war in Ukraine, but the European Union is yet to halt imports of oil and gas, Moscow’s main source of revenue, to avoid hurting their own economies.\n\nA potential EU ban on Russian oil could lead to a shortfall of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 1.2 million bpd of petroleum products, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nWhile Middle East nations hold almost half the world’s proven oil reserves and much of its spare production capacity, lack of investment in infrastructure, conflict, political alliances, and sanctions are among the reasons the region may not be able to come to Europe’s rescue.\n\nHere’s a guide to what oil producers can and can’t do to compensate:\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates\n\nThe two countries have the lion’s share of OPEC’s spare capacity that is readily available, said Amena Bakr, chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence, at roughly 2.5 million bpd.\n\nBut OPEC’s largest producer Saudi Arabia has repeatedly dismissed US requests to increase production beyond a long- standing quota agreed with Russia and other non-OPEC producers, and is unlikely to heed European calls to raise output.\n\nAnalysts say a potential diversion of current shipments from Gulf Arabs’ customers in Asia could come at a cost.\n\nThis would only be possible “within the flexibility of these long-term contracts, or by agreement with the Asian buyers,” said Robin Mills, founder and CEO of Qamar Energy in Dubai.\n\nGulf oil shipments could be diverted from Asia to Europe, but that would endanger the burgeoning strategic partnership between the region and its main buyer China, analysts say.\n\nIraq\n\nIn theory, Iraq can pump an extra 660,000 bpd, said Yousef Alshammari, CEO and head of oil research at CMarkits in London. It’s currently producing around 4.34 million bpd, and has a maximum production capacity of 5 million, he said, but sectarian divisions and a political stalemate in Baghdad mean it can’t be relied on to step in.\n\nIraq also lacks the infrastructure to raise output and investment in oil projects can take years before fruits are reaped, analysts say.\n\n“You have to remember that with oil, it’s just not on tap,” said Bakr. “It needs investment, and this investment takes time to take effect.”\n\nLibya\n\nLibya’s oil fields suffer regular disruptions from continued political tensions. In late April, its National Oil Corporation (NOC) said the nation was losing more than 550,000 bpd in oil production from the blocking of its major oil fields and export terminals by politically disgruntled groups. One refinery suffered damage after armed clashes.\n\nThe NOC temporarily lifted force majeure on one oil terminal in early May, but disruptions remain a major cause for concern.\n\nIt is “nearly impossible to rely on Libya” for spare capacity, said Alshammari, since some of its production has been offline for years amid instability and repeated force majeures on key oil fields.\n\nIran\n\nAfter the UAE and Saudi Arabia’s combined capacity, Iran is likely the most equipped to add oil to the market, but it remains under US sanctions as talks to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers stall.\n\nThe nation can contribute with up to 1.2 million bpd if US sanctions are lifted, analysts say. Data firm Kpler estimates that Iran had 100 million barrels in floating storage as of mid-February, meaning it could add 1 million bpd, or 1% of global supply, for about three months.\n\nBut the US is unlikely to “sign a bad deal with Iran just to put more oil into the market,” said Bakr.\n\nCountries outside the region\n\nNon-Middle East states with potential spare capacity, including Nigeria and Venezuela, also come with issues.\n\nWhen it is said that a country has spare capacity, it means that it is “capable of bringing a given production within a period of 30 days for at least 90 days,” said Alshammari. For that reason, a Russian oil ban “can be detrimental to the global economy.”\n\nThat leaves Europe with a potential American option. But even if the US pumps more, it will neither suffice nor suit European needs because US crude is very light.\n\n“Very light US crude is not an ideal fit for the European market nor for producing more diesel which is what is really needed,” said Mills.\n\nThe digest\n\nISIS claims responsibility for deadly attack on Egyptian troops in Sinai\n\nISIS on Sunday claimed responsibility for an attack on Saturday that killed an officer and 10 Egyptian soldiers in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, the group said on its Telegram channel.\n\nBackground: Since 2018, the military has expanded its control over populated, coastal areas of northern Sinai, allowing for a return of some civilian activity and the development of some infrastructure. However, sporadic attacks have continued with militants seeking refuge in the desert.\n\nWhy it matters: The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years in northern Sinai, where Egypt’s security forces have been battling Islamist militants with links to ISIS.\n\nQatar’s Emir to visit Tehran as nuclear talks stall\n\nQatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani will visit Iran this week in an attempt to revive the stalled talks over Iran’s nuclear program, a source from the region briefed on the visit told CNN. “Qatar has already been assisting with the mediation efforts,” the source said, adding that “the Qataris hope to bring the parties to a new middle ground to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region.”\n\nBackground: Iran’s foreign ministry said Monday that the EU Coordinator in Vienna, Enrique Mora, would visit Tehran to hold bilateral talks with Iran’s top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani. Qatar’s Emir last visited Iran in January 2020.\n\nWhy it matters: Indirect US-Iranian talks to salvage the deal have been at an impasse chiefly over Tehran’s insistence that Washington remove the Revolutionary Guards Corps, its elite security force, from the US Foreign Terrorist Organization list. The US has said it’s preparing for a future without the deal.\n\nSaudi king to stay in hospital after undergoing colonoscopy\n\nSaudi Arabia’s King Salman will stay in hospital for some time to rest on doctors’ advice after undergoing a colonoscopy on Sunday afternoon, the state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said, citing the royal court. It said the results of the colonoscopy were fine.\n\nBackground: SPA had reported earlier that the king was admitted to King Faisal Specialist Hospital on Saturday evening in the Red Sea city of Jeddah to undergo medical tests.\n\nWhy it matters: The king, 86, underwent gallbladder surgery in 2020 and had the battery of his heart pacemaker replaced in March. Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince who runs the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, has had a strained relationship with the United States and is yet to speak to President Biden.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nLebanese expats check lists with electoral staff before casting their votes for the May 15 legislative election at Lebanon's consulate in Dubai on May 8.

Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}
