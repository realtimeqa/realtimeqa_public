The colonists formally declared their independence on July 2, which John Adams promptly called “the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America,” predicting that it “will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”\n\nAs Independence Day draws near, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at who the 56 signers of the Declaration were. We drew on sources such as USHistory.org, the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association to compile our list.\n\nIt was on July 4, however, that the Continental Congress approved the final text of the Declaration – after jointly making some 86 changes in the draft composed by Thomas Jefferson and four colleagues.\n\nCooking out? America, you're grilling your burgers wrong and it could kill you\n\nDogs and fireworks:Scared pets 'think they're going to die' on the Fourth of July\n\nBut that still wasn’t when this seminal document of our nation was signed. That happened, for the most part, on Aug. 2 – but at least five signers didn’t affix their signatures to the Declaration until the following weeks.\n\nAll those who signed the Declaration were delegates to the Second Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia. The Congress was a convention of representatives from the various colonies. The first one, held in 1774, sought to ease rising tensions between the British and the colonists, while safeguarding the rights of the latter.\n\nThe second Congress, which met from 1775 through 1781, was more radical, and ultimately decided that full independence from Great Britain was essential. Thomas Jefferson was charged with overseeing the drafting of a declaration to that effect. (Jefferson, of course, went on to become our third president, and is in the top ten when historians rank every president.)\n\nThe Congress also appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, which was already involved in battles with the British in what grew into the Revolutionary War – one of the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThere’s little doubt what occasion Pennsylvania would claim in a listing of the most important historical event in every state.\n\nThe majority of the delegates – all of them men – who signed the Declaration had been born in one of the 13 colonies, though a few were native to Great Britain or Ireland. Many were gentleman farmers, and many – sometimes the same ones – were attorneys. Most were well-to-do, though some lost their fortunes during the Revolutionary War or subsequently.\n\nSome of the signers are world famous – among them Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams – and some are obscure. The majority owned slaves – 41 of the 56, according to one study – though there were also ardent abolitionists among their number. Some came to bad ends; one lived to the age of 95.\n\nWhoever they were, one thing is certain: These 56 signers put their lives and livelihoods on the line for the cause of American independence, and without their actions we’d have nothing to celebrate as a nation – on the Fourth of July or any other date.\n\nInformation about the signers of the Declaration of Independence was drawn from USHistory.org, which is the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association, as well as from the websites of The Society of the Descendents of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, and the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nJohn Adams (1735-1826)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nOne of the most revered of the Founding Fathers, the man who was to become the first vice president and the second president of the United States (and father of the nation's sixth president, John Quincy Adams) was a noted attorney, an active member of the Continental Congress, and an outspoken opponent of slavery. In 1783, he helped develop, and signed, the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nSamuel Adams (1722-1803)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nA cousin of John Adams, Samuel Adams has been described as \"an excellent politician, an unsuccessful brewer, and a poor businessman.\" (Despite his apparent lack of brewing success, the Boston Beer Company's popular Samuel Adams brand is named after him.) A leading advocate for independence and a close friend of writer and intellectual Tom Paine, Adams was known as an eloquent orator.\n\nJosiah Bartlett (1729-1795)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nMassachusetts-born Bartlett studied medicine and set up a practice as a doctor in Kingston, New Hampshire. Elected to represent the New Hampshire Colony at the Continental Congress, he was the second person to sign the Declaration of Independence, after John Hancock. He later became governor of the new state of New Hampshire.\n\nCarter Braxton (1736-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nComing from a wealthy plantation family, Braxton became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America, before being named to the Virginia delegation to the Continental Congress. He subsequently served in the U.S. Congress. Braxton, who is known to have had as many as 18 children, made poor financial decisions after serving in Congress and died penniless.\n\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton (1737-1832)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nCarroll was born into a wealthy Annapolis family, and shipped off to be educated in France at the age of 8. He returned to America 20 years later, after subsequent studies in London, and promptly became active in the patriot cause. He held numerous offices in Maryland, both before and after independence, and helped frame the Maryland constitution. He signed the Declaration of Independence as \"Charles Carroll of Carrollton,\" a form of his name that he used to distinguish himself from a number of other Maryland Charles Carrolls. He was the last survivor of the signers, dying at the age of 95.\n\nSamuel Chase (1741-1811)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nClassically educated in Baltimore, Chase had a long and distinguished legal career in Maryland, becoming chief justice of the state supreme court and then an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. He held that post from 1796 until his death in 1811. In the course of his tenure, he became the only Supreme Court justice to ever face impeachment proceedings, brought by Thomas Jefferson and his followers after he resisted Jefferson's attempt to weaken federal judicial powers. His acquittal by the Senate was considered a victory for judicial independence.\n\nAbraham Clark (1725-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA self-taught surveyor and lawyer, born in what is now the New Jersey city of Elizabeth, Clark became locally popular by representing poor farmers in land disputes. He held a number of regional offices before being sent to the Continental Congress as a representative of New Jersey. He served in Congress throughout the Revolutionary War, and after retiring continued to be active in community politics.\n\nGeorge Clymer (1739-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nClymer was a merchant, born in Philadelphia, who became active politically after the British government imposed the unpopular Tea Act and Stamp Act on the colonies. He was an avid supporter of George Washington as both a general and a politician. In retirement, Clymer became the first president of the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and of the Philadelphia Bank.\n\nWilliam Ellery (1727-1820)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nBorn in Newport and educated at Harvard College, graduating at the age of 15, Ellery worked as a merchant, a customs collector, and the clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly before settling on a career in law. After the Revolutionary War, he became an outspoken anti-slavery activist.\n\nWilliam Floyd (1734-1821)\n\n• State: New York\n\nFloyd was born into a prosperous farm family of Welsh descent. He became a soldier in the Suffolk County Militia, and was later elected to the first U.S. Congress under the new constitution. In 1808, he became a state senator. His family's estate is now part of the Fire Island National Seashore.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nThe protean Boston-born Franklin, one of the most famous of the signers, was a businessman, inventor, writer, printer, publisher, scientist, diplomat, and legislator. He was the first postmaster general of the United States and a minister to the French court. A major force in the rebellion against the British, he helped Jefferson draft the Declaration of Independence. Though he owned slaves and initially believed that blacks were inferior to white Europeans, his views evolved and he became a major supporter of the abolitionist cause.\n\nElbridge Gerry (1744-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nIn addition to his service in the Continental Congress and as an envoy to France, as governor of his home state of Massachusetts, and as James Madison's vice president, Gerry has another political distinction: When he was governor, he redrew the map of Massachusetts voting districts to favor his own political party. The Boston Globe ran a cartoon depicting the redrawn districts in the shape of a salamander, with the caption \"The Gerrymander\" – thus giving birth to a term used to this day to mean the manipulation of district boundaries to favor one political faction.\n\nButton Gwinnett (1735-1777)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nGwinnett was born in Gloucestershire, England, to Welsh parents, and moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 1762. He went on to establish a large plantation in neighboring Georgia, and became commander of Georgia's Continental Battalion. Gwinnett and one Laclan McIntosh became bitter political rivals, representing opposing factions in Georgia's patriot movement. In 1777, McIntosh denounced Gwinnett in the Georgia Assembly as \"a scoundrel and a lying rascal\" – prompting Gwinnett to challenge him to a duel. The men shot each other, but McIntosh recovered while Gwinnett died of his wounds three days later.\n\nLyman Hall (1724-1790)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nHall was born in Connecticut and studied medicine at Yale. He set up a practice in Charleston, South Carolina, moved to Georgia to establish a plantation, returned to practice medicine in Charleston, and then settled again in Georgia – where he began helping to provision the Revolutionary Army. After the war, he was elected to Georgia's House of Assembly and later became governor of the state.\n\nJohn Hancock (1737-1793)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nHancock, a Massachusetts native who studied business at Harvard College, was the first man to sign the Declaration of Independence. With plenty of room in the document, he inscribed his name large and with dramatic flourishes. \"I guess King George will be able to read that!\" he reportedly exclaimed. His name stands out so vividly on the Declaration that \"John Hancock\" became a synonym for \"signature\" (as in \"Put your John Hancock right there\"). His revolutionary activities included delivering a stirring oration commemorating the Boston Massacre and support of the Boston Tea Party, and he served as both the president of the Continental Congress and the governor of Massachusetts.\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1726-1791)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe father of William Henry Harrison, the ninth U.S. president, Harrison was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and after independence, served five years as governor of his native Virginia. In his time, he was known as one of Virginia's wealthiest men. His descendants included two U.S. presidents: William Henry Harrison; and one of his great-grandsons, a later Benjamin Harrison, became our 23rd president.\n\nJohn Hart (1711-1779)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA successful farmer, Hart entered public service as a justice of the peace and was subsequently elected to the New Jersey Assembly. In 1778, he invited some 12,000 of George Washington's troops to camp on his farm to rest before resuming their battles with the British. Washington lunched with Hart before holding his July 12 Council of War nearby, at which the general planned his attack on Staten Island.\n\nJoseph Hewes (1730-1779)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, and educated at what was then called Princeton College, Hewes moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, and established a successful shipping business. He was known as the leading expert in maritime affairs in the Continental Congress, and placed his ships at the disposal of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. He later became secretary of the congressional Naval Affairs Committee. The Liberty ship SS Joseph Hewes, which served in World War II, was named in his honor.\n\nThomas Heyward, Jr. (1746-1809)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Heyward studied law in both England and America, becoming one of the earliest advocates of the patriot cause in South Carolina. To the dismay of his father, who feared that the British would hang him in retaliation, Heyward signed the Declaration of Independence just after his 30th birthday, and went on to join the South Carolina Militia as a captain of artillery. He later served as a judge in his native state for 15 years before retiring.\n\nWilliam Hooper (1742-1790)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard, where he studied law, Hooper settled in the North Carolina town of Wilmington in 1767. He served for two years in the Continental Congress, and became a judge of the Federal Court after independence before retiring in ill health. He died young, at 48.\n\nStephen Hopkins (1707-1785)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nApparently self-educated, Hopkins was politically active as a young man but also became a successful shipbuilder, credited with helping to transform Providence into a major commercial center. He and his friend Benjamin Franklin were the two oldest signers. Hopkins was also a cousin of the traitorous Benedict Arnold.\n\nFrancis Hopkinson (1737-1791)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn into a wealthy Philadelphia family, Hopkinson studied law there and in England, and held several judgeships in Pennsylvania, though he represented New Jersey at the Constitutional Convention. He was an accomplished writer and composer, whose works included a satirical anti-British ballad, set to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle,\" called \"Battle of the Kegs.\" He also claimed credit for designing the American flag, though the claim has been disputed.\n\nSamuel Huntington (1731-1796)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA self-taught lawyer born in the Connecticut town of Windham, Huntington was successively an attorney, tax collector, town-meeting moderator, and justice of the peace in nearby Norwich, going on to hold several higher offices in the colony. After independence, he became lieutenant-governor and chief superior court judge in Connecticut, and for a decade was its governor. He is credited with helping to build roads and develop industry in the state.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy hosted an assemblage of Nobel Prize winners from around the Western Hemisphere at the White House in 1962, he remarked \"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\" A lawyer, farmer, scientist, musician, architect, inventor, author, and quintessential politician, he served variously as governor of Virginia, minister to the French court, secretary of state, vice president (under John Adams), and ultimately the third president of the United States. He was also the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nOne of the only pair of brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence, Lee was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America and a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment later dissolved by the British. (It continued to meet in secret at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.) He was an associate of Patrick (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\") Henry and later served in the Virginia Senate.\n\nRichard Henry Lee (1732-1794)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nA signer with his brother, Francis, Lee was likewise a radical member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Lee was elected to attend the first Continental Congress in 1774. He was to become the first state senator from Virginia under the newly formed U.S. government.\n\nFrancis Lewis (1713-1802)\n\n• State: New York\n\nLewis was born in Wales and educated in Scotland and England, then worked as a merchant in London before emigrating to New York to set up his own business in 1734. He subsequently entered into international trade, making several trans-Atlantic voyages and surviving two shipwrecks off the coast of Ireland. Though he grew wealthy, he turned his attentions to radical causes and, along with fellow signer Philip Livingston, contracted to supply arms and ammunition to the rebellious colonists.\n\nPhilip Livingston (1716-1778)\n\n• State: New York\n\nBorn in Albany and educated at Yale, Livingston became a prosperous merchant and alderman in New York City. He was a strong supporter of independence in the Continental Congress, and continued to serve in that body after being elected to the New York State Senate in 1777. Livingston was also one of the founders of King's College, which became Columbia University.\n\nThomas Lynch, Jr. (1749-1779)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nOne of the two youngest signers, along with Edward Rutledge – both were 26 – Lynch attended Cambridge University in England and studied law in London. Back home, he was elected to the Continental Congress, but fell ill shortly after signing the Declaration. Late in 1776, he and his wife sailed for the West Indies, but the ship disappeared and neither was ever heard from again.\n\nThomas McKean (1734-1817)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nThe Pennsylvania-born McKean held an astonishing number of positions in both that state and Delaware over the course of his career, including member of the Delaware Assembly, Delaware delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, collector of Customs and commissioner of revenue for New Castle County (Delaware), delegate to the Continental Congress, president of Delaware, and both chief justice and later governor of the new state of Pennsylvania.\n\nArthur Middleton (1742-1787)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nBorn in Charleston but educated at Cambridge University in England, Middleton traveled around Europe for three years before returning to South Carolina, where he was elected to the provincial House of Commons. He was active in the defense of Charleston against the British, but was captured and spent a year imprisoned. After the war, he served in the state legislature and was one of the original trustees of Charleston College.\n\nLewis Morris (1726-1798)\n\n• State: New York\n\nMorris was born on his family's farm estate, Morrisania, in what is now the Bronx, and studied at Yale. While a delegate to the Continental Congress, he also served as a brigadier general in the New York Militia. He went on to become a member of the New York legislature after independence. When the federal government was considering possible sites for a permanent national capital, he proposed that they consider Morrisania – citing as one of its advantages that its location meant it could \"be amply protected by the hardy sons of New England on the one side, and the inhabitants of the populous City of New York on the other.\"\n\nRobert Morris (1734-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in England but arriving in America at the age of 10, Morris became a wealthy importer and businessman in Philadelphia. Financially acute, he was a major force in securing financing for the Revolutionary War, and after independence he created a national bank that became the Bank of North America. This was credited with bringing economic stability to the new nation and establishing its financial credibility abroad. Washington tried to appoint him as the first secretary of the treasury, but he declined and suggested Alexander Hamilton for the post instead.\n\nJohn Morton (1724-1777)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nA Pennsylvania native, Morton held a number of civic offices there, including justice of the peace, high sheriff, and associate judge of the supreme court. He became chairman of the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation – which served as the first constitution of the newly formed republic until it was supplanted by the present-day Constitution in 1787.\n\nThomas Nelson, Jr. (1738-1789)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nEducated in England, Nelson was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and a co-founder of the Virginia Militia, becoming its first commander and continuing his military career after being elected to the Continental Congress. When Thomas Jefferson declined to run for reelection as governor of Virginia in 1781, Nelson replaced him, still retaining his leadership of the Militia.\n\nWilliam Paca (1740-1799)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Paca earned a master's degree from Philadelphia College at the age of 18 and a license to practice law at 21. He became friendly with another Maryland signer, Samuel Chase, and the two became among the leading anti-British voices in the region. He was elected as governor of the state of Maryland after independence, and George Washington appointed him as chief justice of the state's U.S. District Court.\n\nRobert Treat Paine (1731-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard College, Paine worked as a teacher before shipping out on a series of trading and whaling voyages that took him as far afield as Greenland and Spain. Back on dry land, he became a lawyer, and for a time was a friendly rival to another lawyer, John Adams. Paine was known in the Continental Congress as the \"Objection Maker,\" because he frequently objected to the proposals of other members.\n\nJohn Penn (1741-1788)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nA native of Virginia, where he was licensed to practice law at the age of 22, Penn moved to North Carolina in 1774, setting up a practice and becoming politically active. Besides serving in the Continental Congress, he sat on the Board of War, which oversaw military affairs during the Revolutionary War.\n\nGeorge Read (1733-1798)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn in colonial Maryland, Read studied law in Philadelphia, passing the bar at the age of 20, and later moved to Delaware. He became president of Delaware's Constitutional Convention in 1776. After Delaware became the first state in the fledgling Union, he was elected state senator twice and then appointed chief justice of the State of Delaware, a position he held until his death.\n\nCaesar Rodney (1728-1784)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn on the family farm in the Delaware Colony, Rodney was never formally educated. Nonetheless, he had a distinguished career that included participation in the Colonial Assembly and the Stamp Act Congress, as well as the Continental Congress. He later served as president of the state of Delaware and a member of the state assembly.\n\nGeorge Ross (1730-1779)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Delaware, Ross passed the bar in Philadelphia at the age of 20, subsequently becoming attorney general for the Pennsylvania community of Carlisle. He was elected to the Continental Congress three times, and in 1779, shortly before his death, was appointed as a judge for the Pennsylvania Court of Admiralty, which heard cases involving maritime law.\n\nBenjamin Rush (1745-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvanian Rush was a physician and educator, who studied medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, and spent several years around Europe studying languages, medicine, and science. Back in America, he was appointed surgeon general to an arm of the Continental Army. In his final years, he served dual roles as treasurer of the U.S. Mint and professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. When he died at the age of 68, he was considered the most celebrated physician in the country.\n\nEdward Rutledge (1749-1800)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nEducated at Oxford University and a member of the English bar, Rutledge was one of the two youngest signers, along with Thomas Lynch Jr., (both were 26 at the time). He left the Continental Congress to serve in the Charleston Battalion of Artillery, helping to defend the city against the British. After the war, he was resolute in pursuing the prosecution of British loyalists, and became governor of South Carolina in 1789.\n\nRoger Sherman (1721-1793)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA farmer and (some sources say) shoemaker who became a surveyor and then a lawyer, Sherman entered politics as a member of the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1776, he served on the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, and later became a forceful advocate for the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. According to James Madison, he delivered 138 separate speeches at the Constitutional Convention, and Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams are all said to have held him in high regard.\n\nJames Smith (1719-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Dublin, Ireland, Smith moved to Pennsylvania with his family as a pre-teen. He later apprenticed at the law offices of his older brother, passed the Pennsylvania Bar, and set up a business in which he alternated practicing law with surveying. He was elected to the Continental Congress twice, but the second time he declined the position, citing his advanced age of 66.\n\nRichard Stockton (1730-1781)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nSaid to have been one of the most successful lawyers in the colonies, Stockton became a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court two years before signing the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he was captured and jailed for several years under abusive conditions by the British – during which time the British ransacked his estate and burned his extensive library.\n\nThomas Stone (1743-1787)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nStone worked in Thomas Jefferson's law office before starting his own practice, and was also a prosperous landowner. Little is known about his tenure in the Continental Congress, as he gave few speeches there, and no papers relating to his life have been discovered. Grieving after the death of his wife in 1787, he planned to sail for England, but he died himself in Alexandria while awaiting the arrival of his ship.\n\nGeorge Taylor (1716-1781)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in what is now Northern Ireland, Taylor came to America when he was in his early 20s, becoming an ironmaster – the man in charge of a forge. Though not known for being particularly active politically, he held several elected positions, including a stint in the Continental Congress. In 1775, he was appointed to take the place of a Pennsylvanian delegate who refused to support the break with Britain. He missed the vote, but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMatthew Thornton (1714-1803)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nThe Irish-born Thornton came to America with his parents at the age of three. Educated in Massachusetts, he studied medicine and became a physician in New Hampshire. After independence was declared, he was tasked with drawing up a plan of government for that new state. This became New Hampshire's first constitution, as well as the first post-independence constitution adopted by any state. He missed the debates over independence at the Continental Congress but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nGeorge Walton (1741-1804)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nVirginia-born, Walton apprenticed as a carpenter as a young man, then moved to Savannah, Georgia, to study law, being admitted to the Bar in 1774. He was an ally of Lachlan McIntosh in his rivalry with another Georgia signer, Button Gwinnett, and was censured for supporting McIntosh in the duel that claimed Gwinnett's life. He served briefly as governor of Georgia after independence, then became chief justice of the state, followed by another, longer, term as governor. His last political position was as a U.S. senator.\n\nWilliam Whipple (1730-1785)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nBorn in Maine, Whipple became a seaman, earning the position of ship's master – in effect a captain – at the age of 21. Eight years later, he landed at Portsmouth on the New Hampshire coast and established a business as a merchant. He became politically active and served in the Continental Congress until taking a leave to serve as brigadier general in the New Hampshire Militia during the Revolutionary War.\n\nWilliam Williams (1731-1811)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA Harvard-educated merchant, Williams held the post of town clerk in Lebanon, Connecticut, for 44 years, also serving as selectman and becoming speaker of the house in the colonial legislature. Brought in to replace another Continental Congress member, Oliver Wolcott, who had fallen ill, he arrived too late to vote for independence, but in time to sign the Declaration.\n\nJames Wilson (1742-1798)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Wilson emigrated to America in 1766, studying law and being admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. In 1774, he wrote a pamphlet arguing that the British Parliament had no legal authority over the colonies. It was influential on members of the Continental Congress, to which he was subsequently elected. He later served as a director of the Bank of North America, a member of the Constitutional Convention, and an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJohn Witherspoon (1723-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Witherspoon was brought to America to serve as president of the College of New Jersey – now Princeton University – under the auspices of two other signers, Richard Stockton and Benjamin Rush. When another delegate to the Constitutional Convention suggested that the colonies weren't yet ripe for independence, he famously replied that they were \"not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.\"\n\nOliver Wolcott (1726-1797)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nThe youngest of the 14 children of colonial Connecticut governor Roger Wolcott, Wolcott was educated at Yale, raised a militia to fight in the French and Indian War, and was appointed sheriff of Connecticut's Litchfield County. Returning to military life, he became a colonel in the Connecticut Militia and later brigadier general of Connecticut forces in the Continental Armies. Though too ill to attend the Continental Congress and sign the Declaration of Independence in August of 1776, he added his signature in the fall of that year.\n\nGeorge Wythe (1726-1806)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe scion of a wealthy agricultural family, Wythe studied law and was admitted to the bar in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, at the age of 20. A member of the House of Burgesses and one-time attorney general of Virginia, he became America's first law professor, at the College of William and Mary – where his students included Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Marshall. After independence, he freed his slaves and willed part of his family property to one of them – which spurred his disinherited grandnephew to fatally poison both the man and Wythe.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, to announce the enslaved people in Texas were free. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, but slavery continued in Confederate states like Texas until the Civil War ended.\n\nThe local celebration was organized by Sankofa Community Connection board members and founding director Niko Merritt. She pointed to the Juneteenth flag flying from City Hall, telling the crowd this was a first in the city’s history.\n\n“We were out here earlier today when Jamie Bova, mayor of Newport, issued a proclamation recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday in Newport,” Merritt said. “We are appreciative of her continued support.”\n\nBova declared Juneteenth in the proclamation as “an official holiday in the City of Newport.”\n\n“The City will recognize Juneteenth by displaying the Juneteenth Newport flag at City Hall from June 19 to June 21 each year,” the proclamation says.\n\nSome of the signs at the gathering said, “Juneteenth is My Independence Day.”\n\nWhen the Declaration of Independence, authored by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, it said “all men are created equal” and their “inalienable Rights” included “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.”\n\nBut speakers pointed out that declaration and those rights left out enslaved Black Americans for almost the next 100 years.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the states in rebellion. Slavery did not officially end until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution on Dec. 6, 1865, which abolished slavery in all U.S. states and territories.\n\n“It is time Juneteenth is celebrated here and more widely everywhere,” said Ellen Pinnock of Newport, a Sankofa board member. “Not everyone was freed when the Emancipation Proclamation was read.”\n\nShe said pockets of slavery actually continued for decades as plantation owners told Black families they had to continue to work the land to pay off “debt” they supposedly owed.\n\n“The voices stifled for so long can now be heard,” Pinnock said. “To our ancestors, you may have been down, but you were not out.”\n\n“The slaves had no names, except those given to them by their owners,” said Ernest Gibbons. “They could not read or write — where is the freedom in that? George Floyd has sparked a national and international response we hope will continue for years to come.”\n\n“Now 155 years after the end of slavery, we still have a long way to go,” said retired police officer Jimmy Winters, president of the Newport County chapter of the NAACP. Quoting Curtis Mayfield, he said, “We have to keep on pushing. We can’t stop now.”\n\n“The day is so, so important,” said Pauline Perkins-Moye. “By the grace of God, we will continue to be who we are.”\n\nGabby Brown, a rising sophomore at Rogers High School, read a Juneteenth Poem written by Kristina K.\n\n“Skills of art, life, beauty and family/ Crushed by forces we knew nothing of, we rose/ We rose to be you, we rose to be me/ Above everything expected, we rose/ To become the knowledge we never knew.”\n\nSeveral of the speakers talked about the history of Juneteenth and noted at least 45 states and the District of Columbia have declared the day an official holiday.\n\n“Our celebration next year will be bigger and better,” said Merritt, who was wearing a mask like other participants. “Hopefully it will be coronavirus free, so that we can see each other.”\n\nNychole Matthews, a Sankofa board member, said the organization has three main focus areas, beginning with “community events and gatherings to increase our social cohesion.”\n\nCommunity meetings are held to “discuss the impact of institutional racism and racial oppression, and to provoke dialogue and solutions to the issues,” she said.\n\nFinally, Sankofa promotes “historical education to reveal, honor and celebrate the cultural heritage of African Americans of early Newport,” Matthews said.\n\nAfter the Juneteenth celebration, participants were invited to the Community Baptist Church on Dr. Marcus Wheatland Boulevard for a vegetarian meal.\n\nsflynn@newportri.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/07/03/american-revolution-hudson-valley/12158551/", "title": "July 4: U.S. independence was cradled in the Hudson Valley", "text": "Richard Liebson\n\nrliebson@lohud.com\n\nJuly 1776. Revolution was in the air. In New York City, George Washington's troops were read the newly-issued Declaration of Independence as British forces and Hessian mercenaries prepared to drive them out.\n\nIn the ensuing months, all military eyes were on the Lower Hudson Valley. Control of the Hudson River meant control of the war. At various times over the next several years, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam saw a number of battles and skirmishes as the Redcoat and Continental armies jockeyed for position and strategic advantages and plundered the region for supplies. By 1780, one observer would describe Westchester as \"a country in ruins.\"\n\nInteractive map: The American Revolution in the Lower Hudson Valley\n\nHere are a few of the local places where history was made during what future New Rochelle resident Thomas Paine described as \"the times that try men's souls.\"\n\nPatriot's Park\n\nOn Sept. 24, 1780, British Maj. John Andre was captured at the Tarrytown-Sleepy Hollow border by three young Americans – John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart and David Williams. Andre, wearing civilian clothes, was returning to New York from a clandestine meeting with Colonial Gen. Benedict Arnold at West Point, who had agreed to betray American cause and surrender the strategic Hudson River defensive position to the Redcoats. Andre was searched and papers found in his boots included diagrams of the West Point defenses and correspondence that implicated Arnold as a traitor. Andre was arrested as a spy and later hanged. Sleepy Hollow Historian Henry John Steiner said the war could have ended very differently if West Point had been lost to the British. The Captor's Monument in Patriot's Park commemorates Andre's capture.\n\nStony Point battlefield\n\nColonial General \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne earned his nickname on the night of July 16, 1779 at Stony Point, leading a select regiment in a bold surprise attack on a British fortification protected by cannon, mortars and howitzers. Wayne's men, who had been marching from Fort Montgomery in Orange County since July, formed into attack columns at a farm about a mile and a half a way and launched the attack at midnight. The speed and surprise of the assault resulted in heavy British casualties and the fortifications were captured before dawn. The victory gave the Americans a huge morale boost and Stony Point was a key Hudson River crossing that was used later in the war by Colonial troops heading to Virginia for what would turn out to be the final victory at Yorktown. The battlefield is now a state historic site, with a museum and special programs throughout the year, said Tim Chase, a historical interpreter.\n\nThe Dewint House\n\nConsidered the oldest structure in Rockland County, the DeWint House in Tappan served as George Washington's headquarters three times during the Revolution and once after, at the invitation of Maj. Frederickus Blauvelt, son-in-law of the homeowners, Johannes and Antje DeWint. Washington first stayed there from July 8 through July 24, 1780, while inspecting Hudson River fortifications. He stayed there again from Sept. 28, through Oct. 7, 1789, during the trial and subsequent hanging of Maj. John Andre, the British spy. After the British surrender, Washington was at the house from May 4 through 8 to negotiate the final withdrawal of Redcoat troops from New York City. His final stay was from Nov. 11 through Nov. 14 of that year, when he sought shelter from a snowstorm while traveling between West Point and New York City. The house and grounds are owned by the Masons, who keep it open to the public free of charge. The property is maintained by Superintendent Harold Jones, who provides tours and hosts programs there.\n\nThe Sybil Ludington Monument\n\nOn April 26, 1777, Sybil Ludington became the region's Paul Revere, riding 40 miles through Putnam and Dutchess counties to alert local militiamen that the British were attacking and burning nearby Danbury, Conn. Vincent Daquino, who has authored books on the ride, said Sybil was 16 at the time, the oldest of militia Col. Henry Ludington's 12 children. By the time she returned home, having avoided capture by Redcoats and highway men, the area's 400 militia were ready to move. \"By daybreak, thanks to her daring, nearly the whole regiment was mustered…\" her father wrote in his memoir, \"and an hour or two later was on the march for vengeance on the raiders.\" A bronze monument of Sybil on her horse, by noted sculptor Anna Vaughn Hyatt Huntington, is located on Lake Gleneida in Carmel.\n\nWhite Plains Armory\n\nOn July 9, 1776, a copy of the newly-issued Declaration of Independence was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting at the courthouse in White Plains, where the White Plains Armory now stands. That afternoon, the congress voted to approve and adopt the document and declared that New York was no longer a colony of Great Britain, but an independent state. Robert Hoch, president of the White Plains Historical Society, said that on July 11, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was first read in public, to a crowd gathered in front of the courthouse. A monument marks the spot near South Broadway and Mitchell Place where the courthouse once stood.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/01/20/fact-check-george-washingtons-expensive-bar-tab-real/5947984001/", "title": "Fact check: George Washington's expensive bar tab is real", "text": "The claim: A bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington\n\nMany Americans think of George Washington as a strategic general and strong political leader. A post on social media claims the first president also knew how to party.\n\n“The bar tab of a 1787 farewell party for George Washington was left intact and legible,\" a Jan. 19 Facebook post reads. \"According to the bill, the Founding Fathers drank 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of Whiskey, 22 bottles of Porter, 8 bottles of Hard Cider, 12 of Beer and seven bowls of Alcoholic Punch. There were only 55 attendees.”\n\nThe Facebook post received more than 2,400 likes and 1,900 shares in a day. Another post with the claim on Facebook received more than 16,000 shares.\n\nA binge-drinking Founding Father may sound far-fetched, but the claim is true. Records and historians indicate the tab – from a party that took place days before the signing of the Constitution – was real.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post for comment.\n\nWashington’s rowdy farewell party\n\nThe bender described in the Facebook post took place in September 1787, near the end of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Sept. 15, after a long day of constitutional framing, Washington headed a few blocks down from Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to the Founding Fathers' go-to gathering spot, City Tavern. He met up with the Light Horse of Philadelphia, a volunteer cavalry corps that crossed the Delaware River with Washington, inspiring an iconic Revolutionary War painting\n\n\"The City Tavern was the place to go, practically every day,\" Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus at Pepperdine University, told USA TODAY.\n\nLloyd discovered a summary of Washington's tavern bill that night while digging through Independence Hall documents. According to the bill, the soon-to-be first president and 54 other guests did indeed order 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of whiskey, 8 bottles of cider, 12 bottles of beer and seven “large bowls” of punch.\n\nThat would be about two bottles of wine, several shots and a few cups of punch and beer for every guest.\n\nGeorge Washington's night out:\n\nThe Washington Post reported the night’s tab to be estimated at about 89 pounds, four shillings and two pence – the rough equivalent of $15,400 today.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, the tab included dinner for all 55 guests, fees for broken glasses and meals and drinks for musicians and “servants.”\n\nBut the party might not have been all that much fun for Washington, according to Alexis Coe, historian and author of the Washington biography \"You Never Forget Your First.\"\n\n\"Washington really did not want to be there,\" Coe said of the Constitutional Convention. \"He was happy to provide the stable unifying presence that the founders and framers needed in order to sign the Constitution ... but he was exhausted, he was without his wife – who he really liked to be with – and he knew there was no way she would join him.\"\n\nFact check: Shouting profanity about the president is protected by the First Amendment, legal experts say\n\nThe future president likely didn't let the party get out of control, either.\n\n\"He was famously self-controlled,\" Coe said. \"If anyone had gotten out of hand, if anyone had done more than break a few glasses or made excessive toasts, he would have put them in place.\"\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate TRUE the claim that a bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington. Records and historians indicate the tab, estimated to be thousands of dollars today, was real. The party took place Sept. 15, 1787, at City Tavern in Philadelphia.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

But no one yet knows what kind of monarch King Charles III – the title he has taken, ending years of speculation – will become.\n\nAs CNN’s royal correspondent, I’ve reported on Britain’s new King for many years and traveled around the world with him.\n\nOne of the best insights I had was when I was invited with a group of other journalists to Dumfries House, his stately home near Glasgow in Scotland, in 2018 ahead of his 70th birthday. I spent two days there and was given unusual access to Charles and many of those closest to him. I was treated to tours of the estate, high tea, dinners and a spectacular bagpiping performance beside a roaring open fire.\n\nThis is the place that brings it all together for the new King, all his greatest passions and causes – from music to rare breeds protection, apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth and organic farming. The whole estate is buzzing with activity, and I could see what a thrill it gave him to walk around and ask questions of his staff.\n\nEvery Friday night, wherever he is in the world, Charles is sent a hefty report updating him on the estate’s work and he has it back to them first thing Saturday morning with notes. His wife Camilla will tell you he’s up late every night reading, writing and responding to requests for support and advice.\n\nWhere many of his predecessors saw his former role of Prince of Wales as a ticket to a playboy lifestyle and a guaranteed income, Charles professionalized it and made it his own. He wanted a legacy, but he didn’t want to wait until he was King. In my experience, he’s impatient and driven, and gets incredibly frustrated if one of his projects isn’t working or bearing fruit.\n\n“The signs were there from young adulthood,” Kenneth Dunsmuir told me during the visit to Dumfries House. Dunsmuir runs The Prince’s Foundation, an educational charity set up by Charles to help teach traditional arts and skills. “His concerns about social issues in the community and ecological issues were all there and all that’s happened is that he has got more and more involved and has had the time to do that.”\n\nDumfries House is Charles' stately home near Glasgow in Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDunsmuir’s comment points to the other reason Charles achieved so much during his tenure: he was the longest-serving Prince of Wales ever due to the longevity of his mother’s reign. Dunsmuir thinks of Dumfries House, he said, as a “fantastic physical legacy to that work that will always be here and always remain.”\n\nCharles has often struggled to contain his passion for his work, expressing his hopes and fears during speeches over the years and often sounding more like a campaigner than a constitutional monarch-in-waiting. That prompted accusations that he was threatening the independence and impartiality of the monarchy. Take climate change, on which he has been speaking out since 1968. It’s since become a mainstream issue and, for some, a political one. Charles was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump over tea in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next The following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.” I sat down with Charles for an interview that day and he insisted the Paris Accord was still achievable. “We can’t go on like this, with every month another record in temperatures being broken. If we leave it too long, and we have done, just growing things is going to become difficult,” he said. Despite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years. Charles was in his element at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November 2021, where he implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change. Charles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn't work-shy. Victoria Jones/Pool/Getty Images “We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he said at the time. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added. US President Joe Biden commented on Charles’ decades-long efforts at the event, paying him the ultimate compliment by saying he’d got “the whole thing going” and “that’s how it all started.” Charles has been outspoken on a whole range of sensitive issues from genetically modified crops to homeopathic medicines and architecture. It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion. Elizabeth’s legendary ability not to offend and alienate was more strategic than many realize, but Charles has always insisted he intends to follow her lead and stop meddling when he takes the throne. Charles, pictured with Camilla, professionalized the role of Prince of Wales and made it his own. Hugo Burnand/Getty Images Charles walks in Cambridge in 1967 when he began his term at Trinity College. Peter Dunne/Hulton Archive/Getty Images In 2018, Charles said to the BBC: “The idea, somehow, that I’m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two – the two situations – are completely different.” When specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.” In all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either. Charles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes. Charles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife. I’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera. Charles and William, pictured with Prince Harry in 1997, came together personally and professionally when Harry stepped back from his royal duties in 2020. Tim Graham Photo Library/Getty Images In 2015 I sat down with Charles at another of his residences in Scotland – Birkhall, in the Highlands. It was to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary ahead of a US tour. Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral: How the royal family will say goodbye to their matriarch He told me, “It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps.” After the interview, I went with him to a drawing room where we were joined by Camilla as we waited for the cameras to get ready for some set-up shots. Camilla was asking how it went and joking about our outfits, and he was immediately more relaxed in her company. Her ability to steady a room has now become a national asset, as the wife of the country’s head of state – and symbol of stability. With Camilla standing firmly by his side, Charles will now set his stamp on the monarchy. After decades in waiting, he is not only head of state for the United Kingdom but also for 14 other nations including Canada and Australia. The eyes of the world are on him as he assumes the mantle of King. To get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.

I’m not that stupid.”\n\nIn all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes.\n\nCharles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife.\n\nI’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera.\n\nCharles and William, pictured with Prince Harry in 1997, came together personally and professionally when Harry stepped back from his royal duties in 2020.

It was to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary ahead of a US tour.\n\nHe told me, “It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps.”\n\nAfter the interview, I went with him to a drawing room where we were joined by Camilla as we waited for the cameras to get ready for some set-up shots. Camilla was asking how it went and joking about our outfits, and he was immediately more relaxed in her company. Her ability to steady a room has now become a national asset, as the wife of the country’s head of state – and symbol of stability.\n\nWith Camilla standing firmly by his side, Charles will now set his stamp on the monarchy. After decades in waiting, he is not only head of state for the United Kingdom but also for 14 other nations including Canada and Australia. The eyes of the world are on him as he assumes the mantle of King.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/africa/royal-news-newsletter-06-24-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Prince Charles says 'time has come' to confront legacy of ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the June 24 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nKigali, Rwanda CNN —\n\nBetter late than never. That was the general reaction to Prince Charles’ opening speech at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali on Friday.\n\nThe prince will succeed his mother as head of the organization – an association of independent states that emerged out of the ashes of the British Empire. That empire will forever be associated with slavery, and Prince Charles made it clear in his opening remarks that he wants to change the status quo and begin a dialogue about it.\n\n“While we strive together for peace, prosperity and democracy I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,” he told delegates. “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact. “\n\nThose delegates coming out after the speech appeared moved and heartened by the prince’s words. A more resounding “sorry” would have suited some better but that would open the way for reparation claims and that’s a government issue, not one for the monarchy.\n\nCharles said the Commonwealth needs to “find new ways to acknowledge our past. Quite simply, this is a conversation whose time has come. Your Excellencies, conversations start with listening.”\n\nYusuf Keketoma Sandi was part of the Sierra Leone delegation. Tens of thousands of Africans were kidnapped and brought to Sierra Leone, to be traded and put on slave ships bound for the Americas. It later became a British colony.\n\nHe told us: “Slavery has not been part of the conversation, so the fact that we have the prince today talking about slavery and to see how we want to start that conversation… Sierra Leone is looking forward to that and we hope that when it starts he will pay a visit to Sierra Leone and go and see some of the scars left in Sierra Leone.”\n\nThere are still 15 countries that have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Barbados only replaced her with a locally appointed president last year. The Prime Minister of Jamaica voiced the desire to do the same a few months ago.\n\nIn Kigali, Charles made clear he would not stand in the way of countries cutting ties with the monarchy. He said: “The Commonwealth contains within it countries that have had constitutional relationships with my family, some that continue to do so, and increasingly those that have had none. I want to say clearly, as I have said before, that each member’s constitutional arrangement, as republic or monarchy, is purely a matter for each member country to decide.”\n\nThe scars of slavery run deep across the planet. It couldn’t be a more sensitive subject. Royals may have shied away from it in the past but Prince Charles now wants to talk about it and he wants the Commonwealth to be the platform. He wants to be part of the solution instead of a symbol of the problem.\n\nROYAL TEA BREAK\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince Charles attend the CHOGM opening ceremony in Kigali. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nCharles and UK Prime Minister avoid awkward run-in during Rwanda trip.\n\nSpeculation has been rife in the past few days of possible tensions between Prince Charles and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson’s government is pressing ahead with a policy to send some asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda for processing and possible resettlement. British newspaper the Times reported that the royal had described the plan as “appalling.” With a bilateral meeting between the two on the fringes of the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in Kigali in the cards on Friday, British media were watching to see if any of the reported tension was visible. However, hours before the event, Johnson made it clear that any conversation he might have with Charles would remain private. “I wouldn’t comment on anything that I say to the Queen or the Queen says to me. Nor will I say anything about what the heir to the throne might say to me or what I might say to him. And that’s never happened and Prime Ministers never talk about that and quite rightly,” Johnson told reporters on Friday morning. For its part, Clarence House said it won’t be commenting on any supposed remarks except to say the prince is politically neutral.\n\nJOIN THE TOUR\n\nAn emotional first day.\n\nPrince Charles arrived in Rwanda on Tuesday night – the first member of the royal family to visit the country. While he’s here to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), he organized a series of engagements around the main event.\n\nThe first day of the visit was heavily focused on learning more about the 1994 genocide and included a journey to Nyamata Church, in and around which at least 45,000 people were massacred. A spokesperson for Clarence House said the royal couple were struck by how important it is never to forget the horrors of the past. But they were also “deeply moved as they listened to people who have found ways of living with and even forgiving the most appalling crimes,” the spokesperson added.\n\nWatch Max’s report:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bloodstained shorts and machetes: Prince Charles visits memorial to Rwanda genocide 03:04 - Source: CNN\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall makes a speech as she attends a Violence Against Women and Girls event at the Kigali Convention Centre on Thursday. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nOne of Camilla’s strongest speeches yet.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall took center stage at the Commonwealth meeting on Thursday, as she pressed leaders to step up their efforts to prevent domestic violence. “There is power in this alliance. In the strength of our unity, we, the women and men of the Commonwealth, stand with victims and survivors, who, despite the temptation to hide away in silence, speak up so that others know they aren’t alone – whether in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Pacific or the Caribbean and Americas,” the future Queen said in her address. “In so doing, we have the opportunity to end gender-based violence and those laws and practices that discriminate against women. And each one of us must take personal responsibility not to let this opportunity be lost.”\n\nCarrie Johnson, the wife of the UK Prime Minister, was among the attendees at the Kigali Convention Centre. While there may be reported tensions between their husbands, the two seemed delighted to see each other. Johnson warmly greeted the Duchess when she came over to her table during the event, the pair appearing relaxed as they chatted and laughed together.\n\nWhile she is only here in the capacity of accompanying Prince Charles, the speech showed Camilla is already living up to her future title of Queen Consort and showing the same commitment to the Commonwealth as her mother-in-law.

Even now, bodies discovered elsewhere are being brought to the church, as former attackers identify other gravesites as part of the reconciliation process that began in 1999.\n\nLauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nCharles chats with students and beneficiaries of his Prince’s Trust International at the Integrated Polytechnic Regional Centre in Kigali on Thursday.\n\nLauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nLater, he visited Umusambi Village, Kigali’s first and only wildlife sanctuary, during which he learned about conservation of the restored wetlands, the home of endangered gray crowned cranes, and planted a tree.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nDuring the trip, Prince Charles made sure to meet with students connected to his Prince’s Trust International (PTI) charity. The global organization was established in 2015 and has supported more than 45,000 young people in returning to education and preparing for their own careers.\n\nHere in Rwanda, the charity has been working with local partners since 2020 and the Prince of Wales appeared delighted to speak to some of those he has been helping support. The royal made his way around several stalls featuring local products from young entrepreneurs and chatted animatedly with students before posing for a group photo.\n\nSpeaking before the event, 24-year-old hospitality student Regis told us it “means a lot” to welcome Charles on Thursday.\n\n“I think it’s a privilege and honor for the prince to organize (to see) those people who he’s helping to get jobs,” he said with a huge grin on his face. “A lot of people want to meet him but they are not going to. But for us, it inspires us.”\n\nRegis explained that he got involved with PTI as it has partnered with the African Management Institute here in Rwanda and has been helping him train and get internships in local hotels.\n\n“Right now, from the trainings and every takeaway they give to us, now we start going with our career. And I think in three to five years I will have my own business… starting all the way from PTI,” he added.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nRoyals praise Windrush generation at monument ceremony.\n\nThe Queen thanked the Windrush generation of post-World War II Caribbean migrants for their “profound contribution” to British life, as a monument in their honor was unveiled at London’s Waterloo rail station. Prince William, who attended the opening ceremony with the Duchess of Cambridge, praised the generation while acknowledging that “discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for Black men and women in Britain in 2022.” Some members of the Windrush generation, who were invited to come to the UK to rebuild the country in the 1940s and 1950s, were targeted or deported by the government in 2017 in what became a painful political scandal. “It is also important to acknowledge the ways in which the future they sought and deserved has yet to come to pass,” William told the crowd at Waterloo on Wednesday.\n\nPrince William speaks during the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument at Waterloo Station in London on Wednesday.

He also told the artist, Jamie Coreth, that it was “amazing.” In an interview with the Big Issue magazine earlier this week to mark his 40th birthday, William said he was a fan of Renaissance-era paintings and studied “a bit” of art history at university, but gave it up because he “kept falling asleep in the lectures.” Learn more.\n\nThe official joint portrait of the Cambridges.

Regardless of what it is called, the American flag is one of the most recognizable symbols of any country in the world, and the inspiration for our national anthem.\n\nThe first official national flag was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. The resolution read: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.” Each star represented a state and each stripe represented the 13 colonies that declared independence from Great Britain. The colors of the flag were inherited from British flags and have no official meaning.\n\nSince the founding of the United States in 1776, there have been 27 different versions of the flag featuring the stars and stripes. Each new flag represented the addition of one or more states as the United States grew westward to fulfill what it believed to be its manifest destiny of expansion in North America.\n\nFourth of July:Fireworks sales to top $1.3 billion for this year\n\nAs Independence Day nears, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at how each of these 27 flags got that way. We reviewed sites such as usflagdepot.com and various history websites to find out how each state was added to the Union, thus affixing a new star to the flag.\n\nOf the 27 versions of the United States flag, nine flew for only about a year, reflecting the rapid expansion of the nation. Though we have not had a new star since 1960 – Hawaii – we may not be done adding stars. American-owned. territories Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, might be considered for statehood.\n\n1. Thirteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1777 ~ 1795\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797)\n\nThe 13-star flag officially became the U.S. flag on June 14, 1777, and the date is celebrated every year in the United States as Flag Day. Though there is no conclusive proof, Francis Hopkinson, a congressman from New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, is credited with designing the flag. Each star and stripe represented a former British colony.\n\n2. Fifteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1795 ~ 1818\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797), John Adams (1797-1801), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), James Madison (1809-1817), and James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nTwo stripes and two stars were added to the flag when Vermont and Kentucky became the 14th and 15th states in 1791 and 1792, respectively. The 15-star flag would last for 23 years and five presidents would serve under it. This flag inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" our national anthem, after Key saw the flag continue to fly over Fort McHenry following a British bombardment during the War of 1812.\n\n3. Twenty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1818 ~ 1819\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nWith the westward expansion of the United States and the addition of more states, Congress realized that adding stripes to the flag would be impractical. So Congress passed the Flag Act in 1818, restoring the original 13-stripe design and unveiling the flag with additional stars on July 4. Five stars were added to represent five new states: Tennessee (1796), Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), Indiana (1816), and Mississippi (1817). The 20-star flag became the official flag on April 13, 1818, and it was the first of nine flags to only last about a year.\n\n4. Twenty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1819 ~ 1820\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nJust over a year after the twenty-star flag was introduced, the United States added Illinois to the Union, boosting the number of states to 21. Illinois, where future president Abraham Lincoln began his political career, was admitted on Dec. 3, 1818.\n\n5. Twenty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1820 ~ 1822\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nThe number of U.S. states rose to 23 with the admission of Alabama in 1819 and Maine in 1820. The flag became the official U.S. flag on July 4, 1820, and would last two years. President James Monroe was the only president to serve under this flag as well as the previous two flags.\n\n6. Twenty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1822 ~ 1836\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825), John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), and Andrew Jackson (1829-1837)\n\nThe flag expanded to 24 stars with the addition of Missouri in 1821. Missouri, a slave state, was admitted as part of the Missouri Compromise, which sought to achieve a balance of free and slave states during the antebellum period. The compromise included the admission of Maine, a free state, which had separated from Massachusetts and become a state the previous year.\n\n7. Twenty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1836 ~ 1837\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) and Martin Van Buren (1837-1841)\n\nArkansas joined the Union as a slave state on June 15, 1836. Less than a month later, its star was included in the U.S. flag, pushing the state total to 25. Arkansas was part of the Louisiana Purchase and carved out of what became the Missouri Territory to become its own territory.\n\n8. Twenty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1837 ~ 1845\n\n• Who was president: Martin Van Buren (1837-1841), William Henry Harrison (1841), John Tyler (1841-1845), and James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nMichigan was admitted to the Union in 1837 as a free state to help maintain the balance between slave and free states. Michigan's admission had been thwarted because of a border dispute with Ohio – which had been admitted as a state in 1803 – but President Andrew Jackson helped Michigan save face by awarding it land from the Upper Peninsula, and then it was granted statehood, boosting the number of states to 26.\n\n9. Twenty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1845 ~ 1846\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nFlorida, a former possession of the Spanish empire, was admitted to the Union in 1845, raising the total number of U.S. states to 27. It would not remain in the Union for long: Florida would secede in 1861.\n\n10. Twenty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1846 ~ 1847\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIn 1846, the flag would undergo another change, this time because of the admission of Texas. Before becoming the 28th state, the Lone Star state had broken away from Mexico in 1836. It was an independent republic before joining the Union and becoming the biggest state in land mass in the contiguous 48 states.\n\n11. Twenty-Nine Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1847 ~ 1848\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIowa was admitted to the Union on Dec. 28, 1846, as a free state to maintain the balance between free and slave states during the antebellum period. Its star was added to the U.S. flag the following July 4. Originally part of the Louisiana Purchase, Iowa grew dramatically because of its rich farmland. Iowa had been established as a U.S. territory in 1838.\n\n12. Thirty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1848 ~ 1851\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849), Zachary Taylor (1849-1850),and Millard Fillmore (1850-1853)\n\nWisconsin became a state on May 29, 1848, adding the 30th star to the U.S. flag less than two months later. Not all residents of Wisconsin were enthusiastic about statehood. They had rejected it four times previously because they were concerned statehood would mean higher taxes.\n\n13. Thirty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1851 ~ 1858\n\n• Who was president: Millard Fillmore (1850-1853), Franklin Pierce (1853-1857), and James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nThe Gold Rush that began with the discovery of the precious metal in 1848 helped fast-track California to statehood in 1850. California became the 31st star on the American flag the following July 4. The admission of California fulfilled America's manifest destiny of a nation extending from sea to sea.\n\n14. Thirty-Two Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1858 ~ 1859\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nOn the eve of the Civil War, Minnesota was admitted to the Union on May 11, 1858, and represented as the 32nd state on the flag less than two months later. Minnesota was admitted as a free state.\n\n15. Thirty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1859 ~ 1861\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861) and Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nAmerica's expansion surged to the Northwest with the admission of Oregon on Feb. 14, 1859, adding a 33rd star to the flag the following July. Oregon, which had become a U.S. territory in 1848, was admitted as a free state, though its first two senators, Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith, were proslavery Democrats.\n\n16. Thirty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1861 ~ 1863\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nKansas became the 34th state to join the Union. Voter fraud over whether the state would be admitted as a slave state or a free state delayed its admission. Kansas joined the Union on Jan. 29, 1861 as a free state, just as the southern states were seceding, and its star was represented on the flag six months later.\n\n17. Thirty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1863 ~ 1865\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) and Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe onset of the Civil War did not halt the admission of states to the Union. The western part of Virginia was pro-Union and contained many abolitionists. It split from the rest of the state, which had seceded. President Abraham Lincoln was unsure about dividing Virginia and admitting the western portion as a separate state. He agreed to its admission on the grounds that West Virginia's action was an act of secession in favor of the Constitution. West Virginia joined the Union on June 20, 1863, and a new flag on July 4 included the 35th state.\n\n18. Thirty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1865 ~ 1867\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe Civil War was engulfing the nation when Nevada was admitted as the 36th state on Oct. 31, 1864, and the 36th star on the U.S. flag the following July. Nevada was pro-Union and President Abraham Lincoln saw Nevada's admission as a way to buttress support for the war. To speed up statehood, Nevada sent its entire state constitution to Washington, D.C. – 175 pages – by telegram.\n\n19. Thirty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1867 ~ 1877\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869), Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), and Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881)\n\nNebraska was the first state to be admitted to the Union after the Civil War. After the Civil War, rapid economic development accelerated by the growth of railroads helped speed Nebraska's admission to the Union on March 1, 1867, becoming the nation's 37th state and the 37th star on the flag.\n\n20. Thirty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1877 ~ 1890\n\n• Who was president: Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881), James A. Garfield (1881), Chester A. Arthur (1881-1885), Grover Cleveland (1885-1889), and Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nColorado, a territory that partially came with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, became the 38th state to join the Union on Aug. 1, 1876. Colorado's admission had been vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, but President Ulysses S. Grant approved it. The 38-star flag would fly for 13 years.\n\n21. Forty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1890 ~ 1891\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nA flurry of state admissions boosted the star total on the flag to 43 by July 4, 1890, as statehood filled out the United States in the high plains and the far west. Five states were admitted to the Union and five stars added to the flag: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington all in 1889, and Idaho in 1890.\n\n22. Forty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1891 ~ 1896\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) and Grover Cleveland (1893-1897)\n\nSix states were admitted to the Union when President Benjamin Harrison was president, more than any other president. Wyoming was the last of the six, boosting the number of stars on the flag to 44. Wyoming was admitted on July 10, 1890, even though it was 5,000-people short of the 60,000-person requirement to become a state.\n\n23. Forty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1896 ~ 1908\n\n• Who was president: Grover Cleveland (1893-1897), William McKinley (1897-1901), and Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)\n\nUtah became a state on Jan. 4, 1896, and the 45th star on the flag later that year. However, the area that would become Utah had been part of the United States since the nation received the territory as part of a treaty that ended the Mexican-American War in 1848.

Its bold red, white and blue color scheme has become synonymous with the United States, and the flag has earned nicknames like \"Old Glory\" and \"the Stars and Stripes.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the flag's iconography and what it represents.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes:See the 27 different US flags and their histories\n\nIs the Betsy Ross flag a symbol for hate:Depends on who you ask\n\nHow many stripes are on the American flag?\n\nThere are 13 stripes on a standard American flag, alternating between red and white.\n\nThe flag also has 50 stars, which are white and set against a blue background in the upper left corner. They represent the 50 states.\n\nWhat do the 13 stripes on the American flag represent?\n\nThe 13 stripes on the American flag represent the 13 original colonies at the country's founding. Those colonies were:\n\nVirginia\n\nMassachusetts\n\nRhode Island\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDelaware\n\nMaryland\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgia\n\nThe colors of the stripes do not have an officially designated meaning and are inherited from the British flag. However, PBS reports that, generally, red denotes hardiness and valor, while white symbolizes purity and innocence. The blue background behind the stars represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.\n\nThis day in history:Congress adopts the stars and stripes\n\nWhy are there 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes on the flag?\n\nThere is not a specific reason for the number of red versus white stripes. PBS reports that the Continental Congress, on June 14, 1777, passed an act that established an official flag. The act read: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.”\n\nThe numbers shake out to seven and six based on the first of the 13 stripes being red.\n\nDoes the U.S. flag always have 13 stripes?\n\nStandard American flags always have 13 stripes, as established in the original 1777 statute.\n\nHowever, there was a brief period in which the American flag bore 15 stripes.

Doug Ducey responded by ordering the state to withdraw all financial incentive dollars for Nike to open a manufacturing plant in a Phoenix suburb. The deal had promised to bring some 500 full-time jobs to Goodyear, Arizona.\n\nDucey said he was \"embarrassed for Nike\" and accused the shoe and apparel company of calling Betsy Ross \"unworthy.\"\n\nSo who was Betsy Ross? And why is the flag often attributed to her a source of controversy for some? Here's what we know:\n\nIs the Betsy Ross flag used as a symbol for hate groups?\n\nThat depends who you ask, though generally it is not viewed that way.\n\nIn 2016, students waved the Betsy Ross flag and a Trump banner at a high school football game in Michigan, prompting the superintendent to apologize. The local NAACP chapter released a statement saying the flag was \"associated with 'racial supremacy' groups.\"\n\nOPINION:Nike blew it by capitulating to Colin Kaepernick and pulling Betsy Ross flag shoe\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag has been used by many different groups over the years, including extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. He said the association is weak compared to other symbols, though.\n\n\"Most white supremacists would not know what the Betsy Ross flag was if you asked them about it, compared to all the other symbols that they constantly use,\" Pitcavage said.\n\nThe anti-government \"militia movement\" also uses the Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage said that tie wasn't strong enough for the average person to immediately connect the two.\n\nRoy Tatem, president of the East Valley NAACP in greater Phoenix, said he didn't believe the flag was intended to be racist or a racially motivated symbol. He said there wasn't evidence of Ross being a racist or a slaveholder and he didn't find the flag offensive.\n\n\"However, I believe that we should look at the nuance of it, the history around it,\" Tatem said.\n\nPitcavage said the League doesn't consider the flag a white supremacy symbol.\n\n\"It’s not on our hate symbols list,\" he said. \"We view it as a historical, patriotic flag that is usually innocuous.\"\n\nNike released a statement Tuesday it regularly makes \"business decisions to withdraw initiatives, products and services.\"\n\n\"Nike made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday,\" the statement read. \"Nike is a company proud of its American heritage.\"\n\nWhat's the history of the flag?\n\nThe flag we now call the Betsy Ross flag has a circle of 13 five-point stars in a blue patch on the top left corner. Thirteen alternating red-and-white stripes cut horizontally through the rest of the cloth.\n\nThe Continental Congress called for such a flag on June 14, 1777. The number of stars and stripes represent the 13 original colonies.\n\n\"This flag maintained familiar colors but was consciously designed to represent the new polity, and it's no coincidence that the states figured so importantly in the symbolism, since those loyalties ran high and the revolutionary government empowered the states,\" said Catherine O'Donnell, an associate professor of history at Arizona State University.\n\nDid Betsy Ross actually design the flag?\n\nIf she did play a role, she didn't act alone, according to experts.\n\nRoss was a real person. She did work in cloth, and she did make flags, according to Catherine O'Donnell, an associate professor of history at Arizona State University.\n\n\"Historians think she kind of started her own legend, by talking after the war, about her work with flags, telling her children and her grandchildren about what she did,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell said people like to have origin stories, so even though it's unlikely Ross made some crucial flag, it's appealing to have that story of a female heroine contributing to the birth of a nation.\n\nMarla Miller, a University of Massachusetts Amherst history professor and author of \"Betsy Ross and the Making of America,\" said Ross's contributions likely came from more of a craftsmanship standpoint than one of design.\n\n\"In the narrative recalled by her descendants, the emphasis is on her having pointed out to George Washington that five-pointed stars were more practical, from a production standpoint, than the six-pointed stars he initially envisioned,\" Miller wrote in an email.\n\nRoss's descendants played a large role in getting her name attached to the flag, according to Peter Van Cleave, clinical assistant professor of history at ASU.\n\nHe said the Betsy Ross story emerged after Reconstruction, when many white Americans were looking for points of reconciliation, one being the American Revolution.\n\n\"The story, through telling and retelling, became part of American lore, much like the story of Washington chopping down the cherry tree, also a fabrication,\" he wrote in an email. \"Indeed, calling it the Betsy Ross flag is misleading.\"\n\nContributing: Maria Polletta.

Aldrin and Armstrong landed in the Sea of Tranquility on the lunar surface as Command Module Pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n\nThe mission came amid an intense space race with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both the United States and the USSR rapidly advanced in technological achievements of spaceflight, a national security concern during the nuclear arms race.\n\nSpace race:Apollo 11 moon landing celebrated as pioneering milestone, but it was really about winning the space race\n\nThough the Soviet Union sent the first person into space, the United States took the lead in the space race when it landed two men on the moon.\n\nAbout the flag: It fell over\n\nPhotos of the U.S. flag planted on the moon have been topics of conversations concerning patriotism and conspiracies ever since the world first saw stars and stripes on the lunar surface.\n\nHowever, the flag probably isn't still standing.\n\nThe working presumption at NASA is that the flag fell, said John Uri, manager of the Johnson Space Center History Office. Aldrin said he thought he saw the flag tip over from the exhaust when the lunar module lifted off, and the shadow of the flag is not visible in satellite images.\n\nCelebrating 50 years:NASA put a man on the moon. Now, the Smithsonian is putting a rocket on the Mall\n\nUri said later Apollo missions placed flags farther from their lunar modules to prevent them from tipping over. It's likely that the colors have faded over the years from extreme exposure, Uri said.\n\nWhy isn't the flag drooping?\n\nAs expected, hoisting a flag presented NASA engineers with a number of technical problems, Anne Platoff wrote in a paper in August 1993 for NASA on the history of the Apollo 11 flag.\n\nBecause the moon has no substantial atmosphere, NASA scientists led by Jack Kinzler designed a horizontal crossbar to support the flag and keep it from drooping down, Platoff wrote.\n\nA hem was sewn across the top of the 3-by-5-foot nylon flag so the bar could go through, then be lifted and locked into place at a 90 degree angle. The flagpole had a base that allowed it to more easily be driven into the moon's surface, and a red circle was painted at 18 inches from the bottom to help judge how deep it needed to go.\n\nThe astronauts struggled to drive the flag's base beyond 6 to 9 inches deep into the surface, which probably contributed to the flag falling.\n\nThe flag traveled to space tacked onto the ladder on the lunar module, so the astronauts could access it when they walked on the moon. A protective shroud was built to protect the flag from the heat from the engines.\n\nPacking the flag involved a 12-step process and five people, Platoff wrote. Eleven steps were needed to mount the flag on the ladder. The astronauts were able to access it by removing pins and Velcro it was attached to. (And no, NASA didn't invent Velcro during the Apollo missions, though it did popularize its use.)\n\nWhat caused the ripples in the flag?\n\nMany say the flag in the photo looks like it's flowing in the wind. Conspiracy theorists cite this as evidence the moon landing was filmed in a warehouse with air conditioning creating the ripple. That's false.\n\nThe horizontal crossbar was supposed to give a slight wavy effect as in a breeze, Platoff wrote, and Aldrin and Armstrong said they had trouble pulling the flag out all the way.\n\nWhat you can't see: A golden olive branch and hidden messages\n\nThe flag was among various commemorative items that Aldrin and Armstrong left on the moon's surface.\n\nA stainless steel plaque noting the feat of the first manned moon landing, a silicon disc with messages from world leaders in tiny text and a small pouch with an Apollo 1 patch, medals honoring two Soviet astronauts and a small gold olive branch were also left on the moon, according to NASA.\n\nThe patch commemorates Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, who died in a launchpad fire in 1967.\n\n7 things on the moon:Here's what the Apollo 11 astronauts left on the moon\n\nAs for the Soviet medals, Aldrin and Armstrong honored Vladimir Komarov, who died during the Soyuz 1 mission when his parachute failed, and Yuri Gagarin, the first human in outer space. NASA did not officially acknowledge at the time that the Soviet items were left on the moon.\n\nAldrin's book \"Men from Earth,\" published in 1989, detailed the full contents of the packet they left, according to NASA.\n\nThe flag serves as \"a sign of what America really accomplished,\" Ross-Nazzal said. Though there were concerns that it would appear that the United States was \"claiming\" the moon, that was never the intention, she said.\n\n\"It shows a sense of accomplishment and proof that we've been there,\" she said.\n\nWhy the footprints are so distinct\n\nAs Armstrong put it, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nWhen Aldrin and Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, they left well-defined footprints created by the outer boots of their spacesuits.\n\nVoices:My tio's unlikely journey from communist Cuba to key figure in Apollo 11 moon landing\n\n\"If we went back there today, the footprints would still be there,\" Uri said. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter can show the disturbed topsoil in areas on the moon where lunar modules have landed, rovers have roamed and astronauts have walked, he said.\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew described the lunar regolith, or soil, as \"almost a little bit like wet sand,\" Uri said. In reality, the regolith is made of rocks that have been ground up into a fine material over many years under the bombardment of micrometeorites and solar wind radiation. Because the moon has no atmosphere, liquid water or wind erosion, the regolith probably remains well-preserved, Uri said.\n\nThere were even some fears that when a lunar module landed on the moon, the surface would be so thick with dust that it would sink, Uri said.\n\nIs that a moon rock in the bottom right corner?\n\nYes. Though the moon's surface is mostly made up of the fine regolith, various rocks are scattered throughout.\n\nThe white specks seen in the background of the photo are probably lunar rocks reflecting light.\n\nThe astronauts found two main types of rocks at their landing: basalts and breccias, according to the Universities Space Research Association.\n\nThe basalts are 3.6 billion to 3.9 billion years old and solidified from molten lava. The breccias are fragments of older rocks broken up over the years by meteorites hitting the moon. Small rock fragments are sometimes fused under the intense heat and pressure of the impacts, forming breccias.\n\nAldrin and Armstrong collected samples of the regolith and up to 50 rocks during their mission.\n\nThe sky is black in the photograph. Why are there no stars in the background?\n\nWhen people think of what it would be like in space, they might conjure images of a star-filled expanse. Though the stars are definitely there, none is visible in Armstrong's photo.\n\nConspiracy theorists who say NASA fabricated the moon landing cite this as evidence; however, there is a scientific explanation.\n\n\"The only time the astronauts really saw the stars clearly was when they were orbiting the moon and in the shadow of the moon,\" Uri said.\n\nSunlight reflecting off the moon's surface washed out any of the light the stars emitted, Uri said, making them invisible in the photographs. Even the Earth's own shine could be bright enough to block out the stars, he said.\n\nPoll:Americans support NASA but not a return to the moon\n\nThe cameras did not use long enough exposure times to document the stars. Rather than focusing on space, the purpose of taking photos was to document the engineering feat of landing on the moon, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\nArmstrong took most the photos the public associates with the landing. He used a 70mm Hasselblad, though NASA heavily modified the camera, so it would be easier to use while in a spacesuit. A variety of other cameras were also used during the mission.\n\nAccording to the Universities Space Research Association, cameras operated using a trigger and were mounted on the front of the astronauts' spacesuits, which discredits a popular conspiracy theory about not being able to see a camera in the reflection in Aldrin's helmet in one photo Armstrong took. (We can thank NASA's later work for the creation of small enough cameras for an essential device in our modern lives: the camera phone.)\n\nWhat made the long dark shadow behind the flag?\n\nThe lunar module, the spacecraft Aldrin and Armstrong used to get from the main command and service module in lunar orbit to the moon's surface, is seen in the top left of the photograph.\n\nThere were no external lights brightening up the photos and video taken of the mission. The light comes from sunlight and reflections off the moon's surface, the astronauts' suits and the lunar module.\n\nBuzz Aldrin's golden visor is shiny for a reason\n\nEach piece of the astronauts' spacesuit is meticulously designed and serves a very specific purpose.\n\nWhat's in the square pack on Aldrin's back? The Personal Life Support System, or PLSS, according to Cathleen Lewis, spacesuit curator at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\"It provided oxygen, carbon dioxide cleaning, suit cooling, electronic communications to the astronaut,\" Lewis said.\n\nLewis said the suit was made from as many as 26 layers of material, including layers of Mylar, Dacron, Beta Marcasite and Kapton. The suit's outer layer is Teflon-coated Beta cloth.\n\n\"Inside the suit, there are layers of high temperature nylon, fabric dipped in rubber, molded rubber, steel restraints, aluminum connectors, rubber gaskets, a double brass pressure zipper,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe gloves they wore were constructed from a fabric called Chromel-R, a woven stainless steel that insulated their hands. The fingertips of the gloves were made from silicone rubber for sensitivity, according to the Air and Space Museum.\n\nMysterious gray spots:What caused mysterious gray spots to appear on Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 moon landing glove?\n\nTo protect Aldrin's eyes from the intense sun exposure, his helmet had inner and outer visors.\n\n\"Worn on top of the clear bubble helmet, the visor had shades and an outer visor that was a plastic with a monomolecular layer of gold. The gold acted as a sunscreen, much in the way that sky goggles do,\" Lewis said.\n\nThey could have tripped on those wires in the bottom left\n\nIn the bottom left side of the photo, a series of cables appear to run along the moon's surface toward the lunar module.\n\nIt was those wires, powering a video camera, that allowed millions of people worldwide to watch Aldrin and Armstrong during their extravehicular activity, the official name for their moonwalk.\n\nBecause it was such a historic mission, NASA \"wanted to share the experience with rest of the world,\" Uri said.\n\nArmstrong set up the camera so most of their activities would be visible to the millions back on Earth, according to the Universities Space Research Association. The setup went smoothly, but the wiring created a tripping hazard for Armstrong and Aldrin.\n\nAccording to Ross-Nazzal, the public affairs office at NASA pushed hard to get TV cameras on board spaceflights as early as the time of the Gemini missions.\n\nThe astronauts and engineers feared the added weight and operation of the cameras would create unnecessary complications, and even when the first live televised mission occurred, Apollo 7, resistance persisted within NASA, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\n\"Pubic affairs thought the public needed to see what was going on and get excited about what was happening,\" Ross-Nazzal said. \"While the U.S. did it first, we really brought everyone else along.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec/index.html", "title": "Juneteenth flag meaning: Here's what the symbols and colors ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story was initially published in June 2020.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou might see another red, white and blue flag flying today over state capitols and city buildings.\n\nThat banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life.\n\nThe flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date “June 19, 1865” was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation.\n\nFor two decades now, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom.\n\n“This country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,” Haith said. “It (the idea for the design) just came through me.”\n\nDesigning the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here’s what each element of the flag represents.\n\nThe star\n\nThe white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said.\n\nFor one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country’s last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free.\n\nBut the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states.\n\nThe burst\n\nThe bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star.\n\nOn the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land.\n\nThe arc\n\nThe curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for black Americans.\n\nThe colors\n\nThe red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.\n\nJune 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law.\n\nAnd while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better – and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/27/football/iran-us-flag-protesters-klinsmann-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "After US Soccer changes Iranian flag on social media, Iran calls for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIran state media has called for the US to be kicked out of the 2022 World Cup after the United States Soccer Federation changed Iran’s flag on its social media platforms to show support for protesters in Iran.\n\nThe federation had temporarily displayed Iran’s national flag on its official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts without the emblem of the Islamic Republic.

It is a must-win tie for the US Men’s National Team (USMNT) if it is to progress to the knockout stages.\n\nOn Monday, USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter said the team “had no idea what US Soccer put out” but did apologize for the display.\n\n“The staff, the players, we had no idea … Our focus is on this match and I don’t want to sound aloof or not caring by saying that,” said Berhalter in a regularly scheduled news conference on Monday.\n\n“Of course are thoughts are with the Iranian people, the whole country, the whole team, everyone. But our focus is on this match.\n\n“Sometimes things are out of our control,” added Berhalter. “We believe that it’s going to be a match that the result will depend on who puts more effort in and who executes better on the field.\n\n“We’re not focused on those outside things and all we can do is apologize on behalf of the players and the staff, but it’s not something that we were a part of.”\n\nBerhalter insisted any noise surrounding Tuesday’s match was not impacting the preparation of the US players.\n\n“What I see from this group is this tremendous amount of focus,” said Berhalter. “There is no real distractions. I know there is a lot going on here but the group is focused on how to get a win.”\n\nIran is appearing at this World Cup under the shadow of domestic turmoil.

Iranian security forces have unleashed a violent response.\n\nKlinsmann comments branded ‘outrageous’\n\nThe latest controversy comes after a day of issues ahead of the two teams’ Group B clash in Doha at the Al Thumama Stadium.\n\nUS Soccer’s decision came on the same day the former USMNT head coach Jurgen Klinsmann said he will try to speak with Iran’s manager, Carlos Queiroz, to “calm things down” after Klinsmann’s comments about Iran’s culture were branded “outrageous remarks.”\n\nFollowing Iran’s 2-0 victory over Wales on Friday, Klinsmann discussed Iran’s attitude toward the game of soccer, led by Queiroz, during a panel discussion on the BBC.\n\n“That’s their culture and that’s their way of doing it and that’s why Carlos Queiroz, he fits really well in the Iranian national team,” Klinsmann said.\n\n“He struggled in South America. He failed with Colombia to qualify then he failed with Egypt to qualify as well and then he went back right before the World Cup now and guided Iran where he worked already for a long, long time.\n\n“This is not by coincidence. This is all purposely. This is just part of their culture. That’s how they play it and they work the referee.\n\n“You saw the bench always jumping off, always working the fourth, the linesmen and the fourth referee on the sideline, constantly in their ears. They’re constantly in your face on the field.”\n\nKlinsmann has been a manager and pundit since retiring from football. Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images for DFB\n\nThe 1990 World Cup winner continued: “This is their culture and they kind of make you lose your focus and make you lose your concentration and what’s really important to you.”\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Klinsmann clarified that his comments were “purely football related.”\n\n“Unfortunately, this was taken out of a footballing context,” he added. “I have many Iranian friends and was always full of compliments for their people, culture, and history. I wish them only the best for the tournament.”\n\nOn Saturday, Queiroz responded to Klinsmann’s comments on the BBC in a series of tweets.\n\n“Even not knowing me personally, you question my character with a typical prejudiced judgment of superiority,” Queiroz wrote. “No matter how much I can respect what you did inside the pitch, those remarks about Iran Culture, Iran National Team and my Players are a disgrace to Football. Nobody can hurt our integrity if it is not at our level, of course.”\n\nQueiroz added: “As American/German, we understand your no support. No problem. And despite your outrageous remarks on BBC trying to undermine our efforts, sacrifices and skills, we promise you that we will not produce any judgments regarding your culture, roots and background and that you will always be welcome to our Family.”\n\nThe Iran Football Federation, in a statement, demanded Klinsmann apologize and resign from his Qatar 2022 Technical Study Group position with FIFA. Iran said it has asked FIFA “for immediate clarification on this matter.”\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA for comment but did not get a response at time of publication.\n\nOn Sunday, Klinsmann said on BBC Breakfast: “There was stuff really taken out of context. I will try to give him a call and calm things down. I have never criticized Carlos or the Iranian bench. Some even thought I was criticizing the referee because he didn’t do anything about the way they were behaving on the bench.\n\n“All I described was their emotional way of doing things, which is actually admirable in a certain way. The whole bench lives the game. They’re jumping up and down and Carlos is a very emotional coach. He’s constantly on the sidelines trying to give his players all his energy and direction.”\n\nThe federation invited Klinsmann to visit Team Melli Camp in Doha and “for a lecture on the millennial Persian culture and the values of football and sport.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse Wayne Sterling", "Ben Morse", "Wayne Sterling"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/06/delaware-backstory-famous-flag-history-myth/71829148/", "title": "Delaware Backstory: Famous flag, history or myth?", "text": "robin brown\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe arrival of September renews a battle you’ll only find in Delaware.\n\nThis good-natured battle focuses on whether the so-called “Betsy Ross” flag first flew in the first state.\n\nHistorians debate whether Miss Betsy of Philadelphia even made such a “first flag,” noting many flag-makers and credit-takers.\n\nAnd where it first flew, well that’s a whole other tussle.\n\nFor a long time, you could read a monument in Delaware and know for sure that the flag first flew here.\n\nOr so you would have thought.\n\nThe monument was dedicated in 1901, on the anniversary of the Battle of Cooch’s Bridge, near the namesake span.\n\nChildren who were descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers did the honors of unveiling the monument.\n\nThe Revolutionary War fight the monument still commemorates erupted on Sept. 3, 1777, sprawling over miles of farmlands and woods around Iron Hill, also giving the skirmish its other name as the Battle of Iron Hill.\n\nThe monument in front of the Cooch home, which the British made their headquarters, said definitively that the 13-star, 13-stripe flag first flew in battle there.\n\nBut there was no solid historical proof, as challengers pointed out.\n\nAnd, ultimately, the monument was changed.\n\nIn 1932, the State Historic Markers Commission removed the plaque placed by patriotic groups and citizens, replacing it with one that changed the wording to say the battle is “claimed to have been the first in which the Stars and Stripes were carried.”\n\nThat did not, however, stop the late Edward W. “Ned” Cooch Jr. from believing.\n\nAs generations of Delaware school children and history groups of various types visited the Cooch home, the gracious host always would point out the hoof marks on the first floor from the British officers’ horses and the tradition that the first “Stars and Stripes” flew on the battlefield encompassing his family’s farm.\n\nEven absent the type of proof historians required to state the story as fact, he said there had to be reason behind the longtime local account and he found no harm in believing that reason was truth.\n\nAnother battle\n\nMore than a century after an unknown number of militia members and Hessian soldiers fell and were buried in unmarked graves on the battlefield, there came what The New York Times reported “almost became the Second Battle of Cooch’s Bridge.”\n\nThat skirmish swirled around a painting of the state’s only Revolutionary War battle, painted in the 1980s by the late artist Jack Lewis of Bridgeville.\n\nLewis, who died in 2012 just days shy of turning 100, was commissioned to paint 10 historic-scene murals for the 200th anniversary of Delaware being first to ratify the U.S. Constitution, earning its First State nickname.\n\nSo of course, one of his paintings depicted the Battle of Cooch’s Bridge.\n\nAnd anyone who heads down to our capital can see it hanging proudly in Legislative Hall, even cite it as “proof” that the flag was flown there.\n\nBut the painting didn’t always show “history” that way.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Cooch shared the backstory on the painting with The News Journal a couple of years ago, explaining that he and his father made sure the battle painting showed the flag.\n\nWhen Lewis first finished the painting, the flag wasn’t there.\n\nThe story, in part, goes back to the good judge’s grandfather.\n\nHe was Lt. Gov. Edward W. Cooch Sr., whom News Journal columnist Bill Frank regarded as an eminent Delaware historian and whose book on the battle endures as a state history classic.\n\nFrank called him “a stouthearted defender of the story about the American flag’s having been first subjected to military fire in the vicinity of the Cooch mansion.”\n\nThe prominent columnist admitted he was skeptical.\n\nBut over the years, he wrote, he had “come to believe” the flag story, included in the notable Works Progress Administration’s 1938 classic “Delaware; A Guide to the First State.”\n\n“Tradition declares,” the famed tome says, “that here the Stars and Stripes was first unfurled in battle.”\n\nAnd if the Cooches had their way, it would fly in Lewis’s painting.\n\nDuring the 1986 painting controversy, Richard Cooch told The News Journal, “My father and I pointed out that circumstantial evidence indicates that battle may have been the first one where the Stars and Stripes was flown.”\n\nTag-teamed by Cooches, Lewis added the flag. Placed in the lower right corner of his painting, it dominates the scene.\n\nAnd that, too, lends credence and weight to the tale that continues to evade being proven or disproven.\n\nEvery September, when the anniversary of the battle rolls around, I always wonder about the flag.\n\nSome regular Delaware Backstory readers asked what I think of the ongoing skirmish.\n\nLike generations of Cooches and the late Bill Frank, I guess I want to believe.\n\nHow about you?\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

Cigrand, who began observing the day with his class at Stony Hill School in Wisconsin, according to Ozaukee County website.\n\nIn 1885, Cigrand urged his students to observe June 14 as “Flag Birthday.” He later wrote an essay published in a Chicago newspaper urging Americans to also celebrate the flag annually on that day.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation establishing the June 14 as Flag Day in May 1916. He said he hoped Americans would show \"significant expression to our thoughtful love of America\" each year.\n\nDid Betsy Ross make the first flag?\n\nBetsy Ross, the famed Philadelphia seamstress, is often credited for making the first flag. But there's no proof she did.\n\nNo official documentation has been found to confirm Ross was responsible for sewing the very first flag, according to History.com, but it is believed Col George Ross – a signer of the Declaration of Independence and her late husband's uncle – recommended her for the job.\n\nIf not Ross, who? Some historians say it was Francis Hopkinson, a New Jersey delegate to the Continental Congress and signer of the Declaration of Independence. He also played a role in designing seals for departments within the U.S. government.\n\nWhat's the history of the U.S. flag?\n\nOn June 14, 1777, John Adams spoke about the flag at a meeting of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia: \"Resolved, that the flag of the thirteen United States shall be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white on a blue field, representing a new constellation.\"\n\nThere have since been 27 official versions of the flag, according to the Library of Congress. The last change was made on July 4, 1960, when Hawaii became the 50th state.\n\nThe flag today features 13 horizontal red and white stripes, representing the nation's 13 original colonies, and a blue rectangle in the canton with 50 white, five-pointed stars representing the states.\n\nWhat about the 'Old Glory' nickname?\n\nThe flag got its “Old Glory” nickname from William Driver, a Massachusetts-born resident of Nashville who hid his homemade flag from Confederate troops.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Driver remained loyal to the Union and sewed “Old Glory” into a quilt for safekeeping, according to Tennessee Encyclopedia. When the Union army occupied Music City, Driver gave the flag to the troops to be flown for a short time over the State Capitol.\n\nDriver is buried in the Nashville City Cemetery. “Old Glory” is exhibited at the Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhy red, white, and blue?\n\nThe Continental Congress left no record as to why it chose red, white and blue as the flag's colors.\n\nBut, in 1782, PBS reported, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation chose the colors for the Great Seal of the United States with these meanings:\n\nWhite for purity and innocence.\n\nRed for valor and hardiness.\n\nBlue for vigilance, perseverance and justice.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

While this is still within the top 1 percent of American earners, it is very little when compared to the typical compensation given to America’s CEOs and executives.\n\nHowever, many men who have occupied the highest office in the land did not need any salary at all. The presidency has long been a position held by men who had already inherited fortunes or earned them during their lifetimes.\n\nIn America’s early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all extremely well off.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nWith time, voting restrictions loosened, campaign finance regulations tightened, and people with more modest backgrounds began to rise to the presidency. Several U.S. presidents were either poor or in debt when they were elected president.\n\nHowever, even as all these things have changed, the fact remains that the majority of presidents are independently wealthy and only a very small number could have been fairly called poor at any point in their lifetimes.\n\nFame and wealth continue to have an outsized impact on public perception. Wealth and the influence that can accompany it have not lost relevancy. President Donald Trump was able to use his personal wealth to fund the majority of his successful political campaign.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump. For the purposes of comparison, we provided net worth figures for each president in current dollars. Because a number of presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, we only provided each president's net worth at their peak.\n\nGeorge Washington\n\n• Term: 1789-1797 (1st president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $587.0 million\n\nHis Virginia plantation, “Mount Vernon,” consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by over 300 slaves.

Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly signed a $65 million deal for the rights to their memoir, but it is unclear how much of that money they have received, if any. Former presidents often make six figures for paid speeches, and since Obama is known as a great orator, many organizations are likely be lining up for his services. While Obama’s net worth is somewhat unclear, it will certainly continue to climb. American University estimates the Obamas could earn up to $242 million in the coming years.\n\nDonald John Trump\n\n• Term: 2017- (45th president)\n\n• Peak net worth: $3.1 billion\n\nAmerica’s current president is also the wealthiest by far. Donald Trump took over his father’s real estate company and turned it into a massive success. Through his company, Trump owns billions of dollars worth of real estate and golf courses in the United States and abroad.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nWealth is no longer a de facto prerequisite for the presidency, but thanks to the lucrative opportunities afforded to those with the title “ex-president,” wealth for those who have finished their term may be a guarantee.\n\nSeveral presidents went into debt after their time in office, but that may never happen again. Recent presidents have received multi-million dollar offers for the rights to their memoirs about life in the Oval Office. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly inked a deal worth over $60 million for the rights to their book.\n\nNet worth is always difficult to calculate, especially when comparing figures across four different centuries. In the early days of America, land ownership had significant social and political value, meaning those with the most land typically also had the most wealth.\n\nU.S. presidents have been anywhere from some of the wealthiest people in the country to being quite poor. Their wealth, however, does not seem to have an impact on the quality of their presidency. George Washington would have hundreds of millions of dollars in today’s money. Abraham Lincoln never had much money and spent much of his life doing odd jobs before getting into politics. Both are regarded as great leaders and influential figures in American history.\n\n24/7 Wall St. analyzed the finances of U.S. presidents based on historical sources. The figures are adjusted for inflation to December 2017 levels, the most recent level available. We have accounted for hard assets such as real estate, estimated lifetime savings based on work history and inheritance. We also considered annual salaries, incomes earned from royalties on books, ownership of companies, yields from family estates, and other forms of income.\n\nFor deceased presidents, the ranking is based on peak net worth, or how much a president’s combined assets were worth at the time in their life when they were the richest. Many presidents became impoverished or even went into debt after their time in office. For living presidents, the estimate is based on current figures.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The posts, which often feature a black-and-white photo of a man in glasses, also claim Hanson was the very first U.S. president, even before George Washington.\n\nHistorians like James Robinson, formerly of the Durkeeville Historical Society Museum, credited the late comedian Dick Gregory with popularizing the belief about John Hanson in the 1990s.\n\nIn May 2016, a Facebook post stated Hanson, misspelled Hansen, was the United States’ first Black president. \"Barack Obama Was Never The First Black President. John Hansen Was The First Black President & He Also The First President Of The United States Even Before George Washington. We Never Hear About Him In Black History At All,\" the post, which is a photo of another post, claimed.\n\nThe post, which has been shared 13,000 times, was recently viral again. The poster did not respond to questions about the claim.\n\nMore:Fact check: Biden won the most total votes – and the fewest total counties – of any president-elect\n\nThe two John Hansons\n\nThe myth surrounding the first U.S. president confuses two historical figures named John Hanson, one Black and the other white.\n\nThe John Hanson who was Black was a former slave from Maryland who bought his freedom and moved to Liberia in 1827. Liberia, then a West African colony, had been founded by freed American slaves a few years earlier. Throughout the early and mid-1800s, organizations like the American Colonization Society encouraged formerly enslaved Americans to relocate there. Hanson went on to become a senator in Liberia.\n\nWorking with the America Colonization Society in the late 1850s, a Black photographer named Augustus Washington captured portraits of Liberia’s emigrants, including a daguerreotype of Hanson.\n\nThe white John Hanson served as a delegate in the Continental Congress in the early 1780s under the Articles of Confederation, America’s initial form of federal governance. After the Articles were ratified in 1781, the Continental Congress became known as the “Congress of the Confederation” or the “United States in Congress Assembled.\" Hanson was selected among the delegates to serve as the first president of this body.\n\nThe Founding Fathers intentionally constricted the authority of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation, said Peter Michael, author of “Remembering John Hanson: A Biography of the First President of the Original United States Government.”\n\n“It was weak by design,” Michael said. “No one was more acutely aware of this than the nine men who served as president of the first government.”\n\nMore:Fact check: Fake story claims former President Barack Obama was arrested for espionage\n\nHanson held few of the executive powers later bestowed upon U.S. presidents from Washington on. He served his one-year term as president and died in 1783.\n\nRealizing its federal government needed broader authority to levy taxes and regulate trade, the United States wrote a constitution in 1787, which created the structures of federal government we have today.\n\nMore:'Democracy prevailed': Joe Biden passes 270-vote threshold to win Electoral College\n\nPerhaps Washington wasn't first\n\nWhether the white John Hanson should be considered the first president of the United States is open for debate, historians say.\n\n“He was the first president of the United States, but it depends on how you define that,” said Mark Croatti, an adjunct professor of comparative politics and the American presidency at George Washington University. “There’s qualifiers involved.”\n\nCroatti suggests a number of men could reasonably be called the first president before Washington was elected in 1789.\n\nMichael, who is a descendent of the white John Hanson, noted that leaders in that era, including Washington himself, referred to Hanson as the first president. Yet neither Hanson nor any of the men who held the title of president before Washington were Black.\n\nAmericans of all races have embraced the John Hanson myth, Robinson of the Durkeeville Historical Society said, in part because American history narratives often overlooked the accomplishments of Black leaders.\n\n\"I believe the Black community has true heroes that have been woefully underreported,\" he said. \"As a result, the community tends to latch onto heroes that sound right, even without historical basis.\"\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThe John Hanson who served as the first president of the Congress of the Confederation was white. The photograph purporting to be of the first Black president of the U.S. is actually of another John Hanson, who served as a Liberian senator in the mid-1800s. Daguerreotype photography wasn’t invented until the 1830s, making it impossible for a photograph of the first U.S. president to exist. In January 2009, Barack Obama became the first Black president of the United States.

Hoff\n\nDr. Samuel B. Hoff is George Washington Distinguished Professor for the Delaware State Society of the Cincinnati and professor emeritus of history and political science at Delaware State University. He is anine-time independent candidate for president.\n\nWith more than a year to go before the 2020 presidential election, there are pundits and polls aplenty alerting us as to momentary trends. However, the result of the upcoming election may turn on the influence of more persistent features of the American political system.\n\nThere have only been two times in U.S. history when three consecutive presidents were reelected to second terms: 1800-1824, when Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe served two terms each; and most recently between 1992-2016, when Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were successfully re-elected.\n\nIf Donald Trump is reelected in 2020, he will literally make presidential history.\n\nMore from Dr. Hoff:\n\nRethinking the Constitution: On some issues, the Founders might have wanted a do-over\n\nPeace in Afghanistan:We do sometimes have to negotiate with terrorists (opinion)\n\nHowever, long-term historical catalysts may intervene to prevent that outcome, including the constitutional background of presidential terms, the George Washington\n\nprecedent, political party changes, and the recurrence of certain national issues.\n\nThe fact that the Constitution imbues the presidency with perpetual reelection capability is largely due to the impact of Alexander Hamilton at the Constitutional Convention, as all plans except his called for a single term for the president. But even so, the short term provided was a check on executive aggrandizement, the area of government most feared at the time.\n\nThe Framers of the Constitution may have corrected the lack of an executive, which existed in the Articles of Confederation, but they were not going to create the conditions which would allow the type of abuses committed by colonial governors. In some ways, structural bias against long terms for the president remains.\n\nAs the first president under the Constitution, George Washington's length of service would set an important precedent, one which would be followed for the next 150 years. Washington was more than content to step down after one term, but reluctantly served a second term.\n\nNot until the period of the Great Depression and World War II, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times, did the two-term tradition end. But, not coincidentally, Republicans used a period of congressional control two years after FDR's death to propose a constitutional amendment limiting the chief executive to two terms; the 22nd Amendment was ratified four years later.\n\nProbably only two presidents since that time could even think about a third term if permitted, whereas some presidents were defeated for reelection.\n\nWashington reminded us of the destructive impact of factions — his word for political parties —in his farewell address. In assessing the end of the first period in which three successive presidents served two terms each, there was clearly instability in the political party system that developed after Washington's time.\n\nFor instance, the Federalists were critically weakened after the War of 1812 and would reemerge in 1828 as the National Republicans. Alternately, the disputed 1824 election led to the establishment of the Democrat party, led by Andrew Jackson, in 1828.\n\nIn the contemporary environment, there appears to be potential for division within the Republican party which could foster an independent Trump party. Clearly, there is still residue from the Tea Party insurgency.\n\nAs if the analogy between 1824 and 2020 did not have enough similarities, we can note that the issues in the former campaign included tariffs and internal improvements, and that the candidates were favored by sections of the country.\n\nOf course, the 1824 election also saw the controversy with the Electoral College, whereby the candidate with fewer popular votes — John Quincy Adams — nonetheless won the White House. Given that we have witnessed two related controversies involving the Electoral College over the last five presidential elections, there may be a type\n\nof exhaustion for that sort of drama.\n\nThat Donald Trump has been able to command the presidential office while never reaching a majority of public support is amazing. But the early line for his reelection in 2020 is not good.\n\nWhether the American public opts for the same or change, there are long-term factors to consider along with Trump's performance and who he is running against.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/30/one-term-presidents-u-s-presidents-who-ran-reelection-but-lost/6085465002/", "title": "One-term presidents: U.S. presidents who ran for reelection but lost", "text": "President Donald Trump will join the list of Commanders-in-chief who were denied a second term after running for reelection.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden was projected to defeat President Trump, thus making Trump the tenth incumbent to become a one-term U.S. president.\n\nFrom John Adams to George H.W.

Bush\n\nThe most recent one-term president was George H.W. Bush. The Republican incumbent served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993, but lost re-election to Democrat William (Bill) Clinton, who went on to complete two terms.\n\nBush's White House biography attributes his defeat to the country's \"discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending.\"\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nThe 39th president of the United States, Democrat James (Jimmy) Carter, served from 1977 to 1981. He lost his re-election campaign to Republican Ronald Reagan, who went on to two full terms.\n\nCarter's biography points to several factors that contributed to his loss — including a short recession and the hostage-taking of U.S. embassy staff in Iran. On the day Carter left office, Iran released 52 Americans.\n\nGerald Ford\n\nServing from 1974 to 1977, Gerald Ford was the 38thpresident of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to President Carter.\n\nFollowing the resignation of President Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal, Ford became the first unelected president in U.S. history. Ford's controversial pardon of Nixon had consequences — and many blame it (along with numerous issues including a poor economy and the fall of South Vietnam) to have cost him the presidency.\n\nHerbert Hoover\n\nRepublican Herbert Hoover was the 31stpresident of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He lost re-election to Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who went on to complete three full terms.\n\nWithin months of Hoover's election, the stock market crashed — spiraling the country into the Great Depression.\n\n\"His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President,\" reads his White House biography. \"Hoover became the scapegoat for the Depression and was badly defeated in 1932.\"\n\nWilliam Howard Taft\n\nThe 27th president of the United States, Republican William Howard Taft, served from 1909 to 1913. He lost his re-election campaign to Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who went on to complete two full terms.\n\nAccording to Taft's biography, the president \"alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party.\" The party's divide ended his presidency. When Republicans renominated Taft in 1912, Roosevelt left to lead to Progressives, guaranteeing the election of Wilson.\n\nBenjamin Harrison\n\nServing from 1889 to 1893, Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd president of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to Democrat Grover Cleveland. Many point to growing discontent of third-party Populists, unpopularity of high tariffs and government spending at contributors to his defeat.\n\nHarrison had initially replaced Cleveland in the Democrat's 1888 campaign for re-election. But Cleveland ran again in 1892 and won — making him a two-term (though not consecutive) president.\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\nThe 8th president of the United States, Democrat Martin Van Buren, served from 1837 to 1841. He lost his re-election campaign to William Henry Harrison of the Whig party, who died not long after taking office.\n\nHis biography points to the panic of 1837, where hundreds of banks and businesses failed — halting prosperity the country had witnessed in recent years. Van Buren \"devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national Government,\" but his remedies prolonged the depression, and he lost reelection.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\nServing from 1825 to 1829, John Quincy Adams of the Whig party was the 6th president of the United States. The incumbent lost re-election to Andrew Jackson of the Democratic-Republicans.\n\nAccording to his White House biography, Adams' loss is attributed to Jacksonian opponents' accusations of corruption and public plunder — \"an ordeal Adams did not easily bear.\"\n\nJohn Adams\n\nThe first one-term president was John Adams. The Federalist incumbent served as the 2nd president of the United States from 1797 to 1801, but lost re-election to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson.\n\n\"In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided,\" Adams' biography reads, noting that Adams polled just a few electoral votes less than Jefferson.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/11/05/the-net-worth-of-the-american-presidents-washington-to-trump/114599966/", "title": "Presidential wealth: The net worth of every American president", "text": "Michael B.

George Washington’s salary of $25,000 was equivalent to over $700,000 in modern dollars when adjusting for inflation. Yet almost none of the presidents have needed the money, as most commanders in chief had already earned or inherited fortunes – from their parents or through marriage – before being elected.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump. For the purposes of comparison, we provided net worth figures for each president in current dollars. Because a number of presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, we only provided each president’s net worth at their peak.\n\nIn America’s early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all well-off. While there have been some middle-class presidents in the intervening years, many contemporary commanders in chief also earned extravagant wealth – sometimes in excess of $100 million, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nEven being president does not insulate one from market forces and financial mismanagement.

Despite his assets, Harrison died penniless. Upon his death, Congress created a special pension for his widow.\n\n10th: John Tyler\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $58.4 million\n\n• In office: 1841-1845\n\nJohn Tyler was one of many presidents whose inheritance of land and property became largely his source of wealth. From his parents, he inherited the thriving family tobacco plantation in Virginia. And when his first wife, Letitia, died while he was in office, he inherited her fortune as well.\n\n11th: James Knox Polk\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $11.3 million\n\n• In office: 1845-1849\n\nLike his wife, Sarah Childress, James Polk's father was a wealthy plantation owner and speculator. Polk's salaries as speaker of the house and governor of Tennessee contributed to his wealth. He owned over 900 acres in Mississippi. He also owned dozens of slaves.\n\n12th: Zachary Taylor\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $7.2 million\n\n• In office: 1849-1850\n\nZachary Taylor grew up on a plantation and would go on to own significant amounts of land, including property in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana.

He was the only president never to marry. He worked as an attorney before ascending through the ranks of politics as a state representative, U.S. congressman, senator, foreign minister, and secretary of state before becoming president. With most of life in public service and not coming for a wealthy family, Buchanan never accumulated much wealth.\n\n16th: Abraham Lincoln\n\n• Est. peak net worth: less than $1 million\n\n• In office: 1861-1865\n\nAbraham Lincoln served as an attorney for years before his presidency. He also worked in manual labor and had a failed general store.

He lost most of his money on a ranching venture in the Dakotas and had to work as an author to pay bills. Roosevelt spent most of his adult years in public service. His 235-acre estate, Sagamore Hill, sits on some of the most valuable real estate on Long Island.\n\n27th: William Howard Taft\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $3.1 million\n\n• In office: 1909-1913\n\nWilliam Howard Taft's father-in-law was a law partner of former president Rutherford B. Hayes. Taft was president of the American Bar Association, an active attorney for nearly two decades, and the only president to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n28th: Woodrow Wilson\n\n• Est. peak net worth: less than $1 million\n\n• In office: 1913-1921\n\nWoodrow Wilson received modest compensation as head of Princeton and governor of New Jersey. He never served in any position that provided him with a substantial income. Wilson had a stroke in office and died five years later.\n\n29th: Warren Gamaliel Harding\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $1 million\n\n• In office: 1921-1923\n\nMuch of Warren Harding's net worth came from his wife, Florence. She was the daughter of a wealthy businessman and her business skills helped his newspaper, the Marion Star, become successful.\n\n30th: Calvin Coolidge\n\n• Est. peak net worth: less than $1 million\n\n• In office: 1923-1929\n\nCalvin Coolidge's father was a prosperous storekeeper and community official. He spent years as an attorney and also served as the governor of Massachusetts. He derived his net worth primarily from his home, The Beeches, in Northampton, Massachusetts. Some of Coolidge's net worth can also be attributed to the advance he received on his autobiography as well as the money he made from his newspaper column.\n\n31st: Herbert Clark Hoover\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $84 million\n\n• In office: 1929-1933\n\nHerbert Hoover was orphaned as a child, but he overcame his struggles to become a successful businessman and politician. After graduating from Stanford and before entering politics, Hoover worked as a mining engineer, becoming an expert in the field. He went on to own several Burmese silver mines and write a mining engineering textbook, all of which contributing to his considerable wealth.\n\n32nd: Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $67.6 million\n\n• In office: 1933-1945\n\nComing from the wealthy and powerful Roosevelt family, Franklin Delano Roosevelt inherited much of his wealth. FDR spent almost his entire adult life in public service, beginning at age 28 when he ran to the New York state senate. FDR died in office after being elected president for a fourth time.\n\n33rd: Harry S. Truman\n\n• Est. peak net worth: less than $1 million\n\n• In office: 1945-1953\n\nHarry Truman was a haberdasher in Missouri and nearly went bankrupt. He served 18 years in Washington, D.C. Despite his modest income, he was able to save some of his presidential salary. He was also the first ever Medicare recipient.\n\n34th: Dwight David Eisenhower\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $9.2 million\n\n• In office: 1953-1961\n\nDwight David Eisenhower had no inherited wealth. He served the majority of his career in the military and five years as president of Columbia University. Ike owned a large farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n35th: John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $1.1 billion\n\n• In office: 1961-1963\n\nThe Kennedys are one of the most powerful and influential families in American politics, and that was even more true in the 1960s. John F. Kennedy's father, Joe, made much of his fortune through banking and investing. He was one of the richest men in the United States, and the family fortune endures to this day. Kennedy clearly benefited from his family's wealth, but estimating his exact net worth at its highest point is especially difficult.\n\nA number of other siblings shared a portion of the trust. In addition to the family's wealth, Kennedy's wife Jacqueline, was heiress to a vast oil fortune. The couple's combined wealth amounted to more than a billion dollars when adjusted for inflation.\n\n36th: Lyndon Baines Johnson\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $110.6 million\n\n• In office: 1963-1969\n\nLyndon Baines Johnson owned assets such as livestock and 1,500 acres of land in Texas. However, the main source of income for Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, was their Texas TV and radio station business. Though the radio station KTBC was technically in Lady Bird's name, LBJ reportedly used his considerable influence as a member of Congress to make the acquisition go smoothly and make the station a success. The Johnsons later expanded their portfolio to include other TV and radio stations in Texas.\n\n37th: Richard Milhous Nixon\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $17.4 million\n\n• In office: 1969-1974\n\nRichard Nixon was born into a working-class family, to parents who ran a grocery store and a gas station. He was a public servant for most of his life, also serving several years as a U.S. senator from California. Nixon made significant sums from a series of interviews with David Frost and book advances. He sold his New York townhouse to the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. and purchased a large home in Saddle River, New Jersey. At various times, Nixon also owned real estate in California and Florida.\n\n38th: Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $8.2 million\n\n• In office: 1974-1977\n\nGerald Ford had a modest upbringing and spent virtually his entire adult life in public service. Over the course of his lifetime, he owned properties in Palm Springs, California, and Vail, Colorado. After he left the White House in 1977, he made nearly $1 million within a year from speaking fees and from serving on the boards of several prominent American companies.\n\n39th: James Earl Carter\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $8.2 million\n\n• In office: 1977-1981\n\nJimmy Carter's father worked as a peanut farmer in rural Georgia and he did not leave the 39th president much of a inheritance. Carter took over the family farm following his father's death and struggled to make it successful. In his first year on the farm, Carter made just $200, and he and his wife were forced to live in subsidized housing.\n\nThough Carter eventually turned the farm into a successful agriculture business, during his presidency, the business failed as the farm was managed by a blind trust. He left the White House in debt but improved his finances by writing books. Carter and his wife have published more than 30 books.\n\n40th: Ronald Wilson Reagan\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $14.3 million\n\n• In office: 1981-1989\n\nRonald Reagan had no inheritance, but he made money as a movie and television actor for over two decades. He owned several pieces of real estate over his lifetime, including a 688-acre property near Santa Barbara, California. Reagan was highly paid for his role as a GE spokesman before his political career. He also made significant money from his autobiography.\n\n41st: George Herbert Walker Bush\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $26.6 million\n\n• In office: 1989-1993\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, as part of the wealthy and powerful Bush family, has always been well off financially. Bush made his initial fortune running an offshore oil drilling company and owned millions of dollars worth of property, including an estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, which around the time of his death in November 2018, was valued at $13.5 million.\n\n42nd: William Jefferson Clinton\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $76.8 million\n\n• In office: 1993- 2001\n\nSince leaving office, former President Bill Clinton has made millions from his 2005 book \"My Life.\" Much of his wealth, however, actually comes from his wife, Hillary. The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate reportedly received a $14 million advance for her 2014 memoir \"Hard Choices\" – one of the largest advances of all time. She also made millions from a number of paid speeches. Because the two are married, their net worths are combined.\n\n'Offensive and embarrassing':Senators struggle to pronounce Google CEO Sundar Pichai's name correctly\n\nPersonal finance:5 financial moves you need to make before the end of 2020\n\n43rd: George W. Bush\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $40 million\n\n• In office: 2001-2009\n\nGeorge W. Bush was a businessman before he got into politics and became the governor of Texas. He made a small fortune in the oil industry and even owned the Texas Rangers professional baseball team at one point. Bush has made tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees and from a book deal since leaving office.\n\n44th: Barack Hussein Obama\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $135 million\n\n• In office: 2009-2017\n\nBarack Obama's net worth has climbed considerably since he left office in January 2017. The Obama family has a number of income streams, including a production deal with Netflix worth an estimated $50 million, on top of paid speeches and a government pension. Michelle Obama's memoir \"Becoming,\" for which she received a reported $65 million advance, was a best seller in 2018. Estimates as to the 44th president's net worth range from $40 million to as much as $135 million. The Obama family reportedly purchased a nearly 7,000 square foot, $12 million home on Martha's Vineyard in December 2019.\n\n45th: Donald John Trump\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $3.2 billion\n\n• In office: 2017-present\n\nBefore he entered politics, Donald Trump was a prominent figure in New York City's real estate scene. Trump took over his father's business and grew it into an empire. Though many of his other businesses have failed, Trump's vast property holdings make him by far the wealthiest president of all time.\n\nIn addition to a number of New York City buildings, Trump owns over a dozen golf clubs and many resorts. Trump broke precedent when he declined to release his tax returns as a candidate and later as president, so it is difficult to know his exact worth.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

We will align our efforts with our network of allies and partners, acting with common purpose and in common cause. And harnessing these two key assets, we’ll compete with China to defend our interests and build our vision for the future,” said Blinken.\n\nThe speech comes as much of the focus of the United States – and the global community – has been turned to Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nBlinken highlighted “Beijing’s defense of President Putin’s war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe,” saying it “should raise alarm bells for all of us, who call the Indo-Pacific region home,” and more broadly emphasized the importance of focusing on the threats he said the Chinese government poses to the world, even as the war in Ukraine wages on.\n\n“China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it,” Blinken said.\n\nBlinken’s roughly 40-minute long speech sought to underscore the degree to which the Washington-Beijing relationship is “one of the most complex and consequential relationships of any that we have in the world today.”\n\nAs he broadly described how the US intends to approach that relationship, he drew sharp distinctions between the two nations, describing things like China’s “repressive” government, unfair trade practices and human rights abuses.\n\nHowever, the top US diplomat also repeatedly stressed that the US does not seek to stymy China as a world power or change its political system, nor does it seek a clash with it.\n\n“We are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War. To the contrary, we’re determined to avoid both,” Blinken said.\n\nHe said the US is ready to strengthen diplomacy and increase communication with China “across a full range of issues,” and is prepared to work together on matters of mutual interest like climate change and Covid-19, noting that “even as we invest, align and compete, or together with Beijing, where our interests come together.”\n\n“We can’t let the disagreements that divide us stop us from moving forward on the priorities that demand that we work together for the good of our people and for the good of the world,” he said.\n\nBlinken noted that “this is a charged moment for the world.”\n\n“And at times like these, diplomacy is vital,” the top US diplomat said. “It’s how we make clear our profound concerns, better understand each other’s perspective, and have no doubt about each other’s intentions.”\n\n“We stand ready to increase our direct communication with Beijing across a full range of issues. And we hope that can happen,” he continued.\n\nNew State Department China team\n\nAs a means to try to foster that diplomacy, Blinken said he was determined to give the State Department the necessary tools, including “building a ‘China House,’ a department-wide integrated team that will coordinate and implement our policy across issues and regions, working with Congress as needed.”\n\n“We remain committed to intense diplomacy, alongside intense competition,” he said.\n\nHowever, Blinken also warned, “we can’t rely on Beijing to change its trajectory. So we will shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our vision for an open and inclusive international system.”\n\n“We don’t seek to block China from its role as a major power, nor to stop China – or any country for that matter – from growing their economy or advancing the interests of their people. But we will defend and strengthen the international law, agreements, principles, and institutions that maintain peace and security, protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations, and make it possible for all countries – including the United States and China – to coexist and cooperate,” Blinken said.\n\nOn Taiwan, the top US diplomat again stressed that US policy towards the island over which China claims sovereignty has not changed, despite comments by President Joe Biden last week that the US would respond militarily if Beijing attacked Taiwan.\n\n“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We do not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means,” Blinken said.\n\nHowever, Blinken noted that “while our policy has not changed, what has changed is Beijing’s growing coercion, like trying to cut off Taiwan’s relations with countries around the world and blocking it from participating in international organizations, and Beijing is engaged in increasingly provocative rhetoric and activity, like flying PLA aircraft near Taiwan on an almost daily basis.”\n\n“These words and actions are deeply destabilizing. They risk miscalculation and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. As we saw from the President’s discussions with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, maintaining peace and stability across the street is not just a US interest, it is a matter of international concern, critical to regional and global security and prosperity.”\n\nThe top US diplomat also emphasized the importance of ensuring that even as tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, ire is not focused the people of China or those of Chinese descent in the US.\n\n“We also know from our history that when we’re managing a challenging relationship with another government, people from that country or with that heritage can be made to feel that they don’t belong here, or that they’re our adversaries. Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.\n\n“Mistreating someone of Chinese descent goes against everything we stand for as a country,” Blinken continued, noting that the “differences are between governments and systems, not between our people.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Michael Conte", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Michael Conte"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/19/presidents-day-closures-2023/11257805002/", "title": "President's Day 2023: Is the post office open?

The fact it took this long tells the tale of America’s bitter, fractured politics.\n\nThe former first couple will attend the unveiling of their official White House portraits — an honor accorded to all former Presidents and their spouses. The 44th President was back at his old digs earlier this year for a health care event with President Joe Biden, but it will be Michelle Obama’s first return since she handed the presidential mansion over to the Trumps on January 20, 2017.\n\nGenerally, the portrait ceremony takes place during the succeeding presidency – typically a lighthearted affair to show bipartisanship and continuity across party lines. Yet, to no one’s surprise, Obama’s portrait dedication didn’t happen during his successor’s White House term; ex-President Donald Trump had no interest in sharing the presidential limelight with anyone. And Obama was hardly going to stand beside the man who authored a racist conspiracy theory that he wasn’t born in the United States. So it has fallen to Biden to do the honors.\n\nSuch ceremonies also serve as a reminder that presidents serve all Americans, and that some things – like respect for an office first held by George Washington – supersede politics. Sitting presidents often pay tribute to their predecessor’s record in office, going out of their way to find areas of agreement even if they were from different parties. In the portrait ceremony during then-President Bill Clinton’s first term, he praised predecessor George H.W. Bush – an ex-World War II pilot, US representative to China, CIA chief, vice president and President – for an “entire lifetime of public service.” Bush was gracious in return. And like all returning presidents, he said how much he loved the permanent White House staff and even confessed to missing the press corps.\n\nThe event was especially poignant as a show of unity because Clinton had beaten Bush in an acrimonious election in 1992 – though they later became friends.\n\nNine years later, Bush’s son, George W. Bush, later repaid the compliment when he unveiled portraits of Clinton and ex-first lady Hillary Clinton.\n\n“Welcome home,” the 43rd President told them. “Bill Clinton loved the job of the presidency. He filled this house with energy and joy,” he added.\n\nGeorge W. Bush returned to the White House for his portrait unveiling in 2012, more than three years after his two terms ended.\n\nObama, in his turn, recalled how his predecessor embodied national resolve after the carnage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. And he quipped that he also left him a great cable TV sports package.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine Biden welcoming Trump back to the executive mansion for a portrait unveiling – not least because the ex-President still insists falsely that he won the 2020 election. And if Trump or another hardline Republican wins the White House next, Biden could be kept waiting, too.\n\nWhen his portrait – which hangs in the presidential mansion alongside his counterparts throughout history – was unveiled, Clinton yearned for an earlier age. “I hope that I will live long enough to see American politics return to the vigorous debate where we argue who is right and wrong, not who’s good and bad.” That is more of a pipe dream now than when Clinton spoke.\n\nThis week’s presidential portrait ceremony – and the interruption to this one tiny part of Washington convention – shows how far from normal things have become.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Obamas left the White House on January 20, 2017.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson Caitlin Hu Shelrose", "Stephen Collinson", "Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/uss-george-washington-conditions/index.html", "title": "USS George Washington: Sailors say aircraft carrier that had ...", "text": "Newport News, Virginia CNN —\n\nThe commanding officer stood before the sailors of the USS George Washington’s security team. One of their own, Xavier Sandor, had taken his life a few weeks earlier in mid-April, and the captain had come down to speak with the 110 or so young men and women who worked closely with him.\n\nThe conversation with Capt. Brent Gaut lasted two hours, according to four sailors in attendance who spoke with CNN. In it, Gaut acknowledged what the sailors had felt for months. He said the crew had moved back onto the aircraft carrier too soon, the sailors recalled, but it was too late to go back.\n\nAnother sailor told CNN Gaut spoke over the shipwide speaker system, known as 1MC or 1 Main Circuit, about two months ago and said the ship, which had been undergoing major maintenance, wasn’t ready for sailors to move aboard when the process began last summer. But he said, “There’s no turning back now. We can’t reverse course.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Navy for comment on Gaut’s remarks.\n\nThe situation on the aircraft carrier came to national attention when three sailors died by suicide in one week last month. But twelve current and former crewmembers of the George Washington who spoke with CNN, painted a disturbing picture of a ship with myriad issues, including what many said were terrible accommodation standards on the vessel which was effectively a construction site, concerns over the quality of food and a sense that leadership was not tackling the problems and dismissing complaints.\n\nBut they weren’t the only deaths on the carrier as it remained docked at the Newport News shipyard. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has been going through its mid-life refueling and overhaul process since the summer of 2017. The process, initially expected to last four years, has been delayed multiple times until at least March 2023, the Navy said.\n\n‘Awful’ conditions\n\nThe sailors who agreed to speak with CNN all said the ship was uninhabitable. Sailors began moving aboard the carrier about one year ago, after the ship had already been in its refueling and overhaul process for four years and was supposed to be ready to accommodate parts of the crew. Even after years of work to prepare the carrier for its next deployment, the ship remained a construction zone around the clock. Often, the challenges of life on the ship hit the youngest sailors hardest.\n\n“I was ready for a sh*tty situation, but I had no idea it would be in the yards,” one sailor currently assigned to the George Washington told CNN. Most of the sailors spoke on condition of anonymity, fearful of the consequences of speaking out to their own careers in the Navy or those of their friends.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the crew of the USS George Washington has suffered seven deaths, of which at least four are by suicide, the Navy said. Xavier Sandor, who worked in security on board the ship, according to those who knew him, took his own life on April 15th, the third suicide in one week amongst the crew.\n\nSandor’s father, John Sandor, said his son was proud to join the Navy right out of high school, following in his grandfather’s footsteps. But Xavier once told his father the conditions on the ship were “awful.”\n\n“How do you sleep on an aircraft carrier with jack hammering and smokes and smells during the day?” asked John Sandor, demanding an explanation. “He would sleep in his car. No sailor should even have been living on that ship in those conditions.”\n\nThe suicides become a tragic reality of the carrier, sailors told CNN, instead of an aberration. “I wasn’t surprised. From being on the ship as long as I have been, that’s something that unfortunately I’ve become accustomed to,” said a second sailor on the George Washington. “I’ve seen it, it’s nothing new.”\n\nOn board the ship, it was nearly impossible to find a quiet place to sleep, the sailors said, and the ship suffered constant power outages and lacked hot water. The berthings often lacked ventilation, they said, and the massive metal structure of the vessel amplified the temperature outside until it became unbearable.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN talks to parents of sailor who died by suicide on Navy ship 05:14 - Source: CNN\n\n“I would wake up in the middle of the night freezing my ass off,” another sailor told CNN. “I lived in my car in the winter, and I still felt it better than my berthing.” The sailor, who says he was 19 years old at the time, was shocked at the conditions on the ship, a far cry from his expectations of what life was like in the Navy. He lived in his car off and on for about 3 weeks, he says, until he become more accustomed to the confines of the carrier.\n\n“This is the very bottom,” he told CNN, speaking of the situation on the USS George Washington.\n\nCmdr. Robert Myers, a spokesman for Naval Air Force Atlantic, said the mess decks and berthings were inspected before the first sailors moved aboard the ship. In addition, he said the command duty officers completed meal evaluations on a daily basis as a way of maintaining quality control of the food served to the sailors living and working aboard.\n\nWhen several members of Congress visited the ship earlier this week, the spaces they visited, which included galleys and berthings, were well maintained, Myers told CNN on Friday.\n\nCrew moved off the ship\n\nEarlier this week, the ship’s commanding officer announced that about half of the more than 400 crew members living on board the carrier would move to temporary housing off the ship. Others who wanted to do the same would also be given the opportunity. The sailors who spoke with CNN all agreed it was the right thing to do.\n\nAsked if the Navy was aware that crewmembers were sleeping in their cars instead of on the ship, Myers said every sailor is “provided the means to accommodations,” and the Navy will look at whether housing was a factor in the suicides.\n\n“Navy and Congressional leadership have met extensively with the current leadership aboard USS George Washington, and feel confident that the leadership team is working hard – within and beyond their lifelines – to care for the crew,” said Myers in a statement to CNN on Thursday. “Our current focus is on ensuring that we are providing a safe and healthy environment for our sailors aboard GW, and that the shipboard leadership team has the resources to do so.”\n\nOne sailor shared with CNN messages from the ship’s digital suggestion box, where people could flag issues or share ideas. Many of the posts were categorized as “Quality of Life,” and focused on issues like distant parking, low morale or the food. But rarely did anything change, the sailors said.\n\n“The complaints won’t do anything. You just have to suffer in silence,” said a fourth sailor assigned to the ship.\n\nEven a complete meal was sometimes hard to come by, multiple sailors told CNN.\n\n“They would just run out of food, and if they had anything left, it would be – if you’re lucky – a little cereal thing or one little chicken leg that may or not be undercooked,” said the fourth sailor who often worked late-night security shifts.\n\n“Prisoners got better food than what we got in the military,” said a sailor who had recently transferred away from the USS George Washington. The carrier was her first assignment, and she says she developed a drinking problem for a time because of the living conditions.\n\n“This is the most insane environment that I’ve ever had to experience,” she said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Russell Smith, the service’s top enlisted sailor, visited the George Washington and spoke to the crew. In a statement issued afterwards, he said his visit to the ship was about an “open and honest dialogue” where he wanted to “learn about the difficulties our sailors are facing” and to “understand their concerns.”\n\nBut when he told the sailors they should have “reasonable expectations” and that they’re not “sleeping in a foxhole like a Marine might be doing,” some crewmembers were stunned. The fourth sailor from the ship called it a “laughable, offensive speech.”\n\n“That’s not a reason for why we live the way we do,” said the second sailor. “Things can be done to fix what we’re going through.”\n\nAnother former sailor assigned to the George Washington called the situation on board “unacceptable,” especially given the resources available to the military to address the living conditions and the quality of life.\n\n“This isn’t Afghanistan where you’re expecting those circumstances,” he said. “This is Newport News, Virginia.”\n\nInvestigations\n\nFollowing the most recent suicides, the Navy opened two investigations. The first, which is expected to be completed soon, looks specifically at the recent deaths on board the ship. The second, broader investigation will examine the command climate and culture at the shipyard in Newport News, including the housing, parking, and quality of life issues.\n\nThe Navy is “confident that our comprehensive investigation and assessment into the command climate and various quality of life issues will identify areas for future improvements as well as provide recommendations for immediate action,” said Commander Myers.\n\nThe commander of US Naval Air Force Atlantic, Admiral John Meier, said the ship also added more mental health resources, such as a special intervention team and an additional psychologist. Crewmembers aboard the USS George Washington will also have access to tele-mental health resources as well and on-board training for junior sailors.\n\nThe increase in mental health resources is long overdue, according to the sailors who spoke with CNN. Though the ship had a clinical psychologist, sailors said they would have to wait months for an appointment.\n\nWhen Jacob Grella, who spent most of his time in the Navy assigned to the George Washington, found out he was assigned to the carrier, which was a short drive from his family in Richmond, Virginia, he said on Facebook that he was “So Freaking Happy.” But it didn’t take long for his occasional weekend trips home to become a chance to escape from the ship.\n\nGrella said he tried to schedule a visit to the ship’s psychologist during his last year on the ship.\n\nWhen he did, he was met with “a six-month wait period,” at which point “I would’ve been almost out of the Navy.”\n\nDespite his frustration, Grella and many of the other sailors who spoke with CNN believed that a profound change in the culture and the climate of the ship was achievable.\n\n“I think that’s definitely possible,” he said, “but for that to happen, I think at this point accountability needs to be held for everybody. you need to start looking at what’s causing the setbacks and who’s causing this negative treatment and the mindsets on these poor kids.”\n\nEditor’s Note: If you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text TALK to 741741.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Henry Klapper", "Oren Liebermann", "Henry Klapper"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}]}

So, here is rundown on the first president, the current and all those in-between.\n\nWhat are the three branches of government?

Journal News\n\nYONKERS, N.Y. — An auction house in New York is selling a letter by George Washington describing a sale of 90 slaves he supervised less than two years before the Declaration of Independence.\n\nCohasco Inc., of Yonkers, N.Y., is offering the founding father's letter, a reward poster for runaway slaves and 440 other historical documents in an auction ending 8 p.m. ET Wednesday. One of the auction's highlights is the Washington 1774 letter describing his sale of the Virginia estate of Col. George Mercer, a friend who served under Washington in the French & Indian War.\n\n\"What makes the letter historically significant is that Washington started life as a slave owner in his early teens and by about this time he began to realize that he had a conflict, an intellectual conflict,\" said Bob Snyder, vice president of Cohasco. \"On the one hand he was agitating for American independence and freedom. On the other hand he's surrounded by slaves.\"\n\nCohasco estimated the value of the Washington letter at $32,000 to $40,000, but as of Monday morning, the bidding for it was about $45,000. Snyder declined to reveal the name of the person selling the Washington letter.\n\n► Related:New photo shows ‘beautiful, resilient’ Harriet Tubman\n\nSnyder said that Washington's sale of the Mercer slaves before the Revolutionary War helped change Washington's views on slavery.\n\n\"Suddenly he found himself in direct contact with black soldiers, some of whom were free blacks, some were slaves, some were slaves who had been promised their freedom if they would serve, and many did on that basis,\" Snyder said. \"So he began to have this contact with them in another context, as opposed to being on a plantation.\"\n\nCohasco holds auctions once or twice a year, often in February. Snyder said that the auction's end date was adjusted so that it would fall near Presidents Day in a nod to the documents related to Washington, Abraham Lincoln and black history.\n\nThe Lincoln connection in Cohasco's auction is an 1848 runaway slave poster offering a $250 reward for the capture and return of three black sisters named Maria, Susan and Harriet Johnson to their owner in Washington, D.C. The sisters were eventually caught and remained slaves until they were freed in 1864 when Lincoln's administration paid for their and other Washington, D.C., slaves' emancipation, 14 years after slavery was officially abolished in the nation's capital.\n\nSnyder described the poster as rare because it was never intended to be saved.\n\n\"They were printed under very crude conditions. You can see the wood type was used, not even metal type here, and they were printed in small numbers,\" Snyder said. \"They were meant basically to be nailed to a tree or put up in the general store and then if the wind blew it down they would just wash into the gutter and that was the end of it, so the fact that any of them survived is only an accident.\"\n\n► Related:Hitler's phone which 'sent millions to their deaths' sold for $243K at auction\n\nThe reason the three sister slaves poster survived is attributable to a handwritten annotation on the bottom of the poster stating that the poster was used in a legal proceeding against the three sisters.\n\nCohasco estimated the runaway slaves poster's value at $6,500 to $9,000, but as of Monday morning, the bidding was at $12,000.\n\nSnyder said the Washington letter and the runaway slaves poster don't necessarily appeal to one type of collector because collectors have varied interests.\n\n\"There are people who only collect Lincoln, Babe Ruth, Washington, Geronimo, whatever it is,\" he said. \"And there are collectors of African American stuff exclusively, many of whom are white.\"\n\nFollow Ernie Garcia on Twitter: @ErnieJourno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/08/brennan-oath-george-washington-constitution/1974207/", "title": "Brennan sworn in with original draft of Constitution", "text": "Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY\n\nNew CIA director requested the historical document from the National Archives\n\nWASHINGTON — When John Brennan was sworn in as the new Central Intelligence Agency director on Friday morning, he put his left hand on a piece of history as he delivered his oath.\n\nAt Brennan's request, the National Archives loaned Brennan an original draft of the U.S. Constitution for the private swearing-in ceremony at the White House.

Sauter, Grant Suneson and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSince 2001, the annual presidential salary has been set at $400,000. Even before that, every president has been paid well. George Washington’s salary of $25,000 was equivalent to over $700,000 in modern dollars when adjusting for inflation. Yet almost none of the presidents have needed the money, as most commanders in chief had already earned or inherited fortunes – from their parents or through marriage – before being elected.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump. For the purposes of comparison, we provided net worth figures for each president in current dollars. Because a number of presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, we only provided each president’s net worth at their peak.\n\nIn America’s early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all well-off. While there have been some middle-class presidents in the intervening years, many contemporary commanders in chief also earned extravagant wealth – sometimes in excess of $100 million, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nEven being president does not insulate one from market forces and financial mismanagement. Some presidents had failed business ventures in their early careers, while others became insolvent after leaving office, frittering away their fortunes.\n\nSome Americans want to leave U.S.:Here’s what life abroad is really like for ex-pats\n\n'I will be put out of my house':Some Americans who struggled early in crisis are on brink, others find jobs\n\n1st: George Washington\n\n• Est. peak net worth: $594.2 million\n\n• In office: 1789-1797\n\nGeorge Washington was America's first president and also its wealthiest for more than a century.

While this is still within the top 1 percent of American earners, it is very little when compared to the typical compensation given to America’s CEOs and executives.\n\nHowever, many men who have occupied the highest office in the land did not need any salary at all. The presidency has long been a position held by men who had already inherited fortunes or earned them during their lifetimes.\n\nIn America’s early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all extremely well off.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nWith time, voting restrictions loosened, campaign finance regulations tightened, and people with more modest backgrounds began to rise to the presidency. Several U.S. presidents were either poor or in debt when they were elected president.\n\nHowever, even as all these things have changed, the fact remains that the majority of presidents are independently wealthy and only a very small number could have been fairly called poor at any point in their lifetimes.\n\nFame and wealth continue to have an outsized impact on public perception. Wealth and the influence that can accompany it have not lost relevancy. President Donald Trump was able to use his personal wealth to fund the majority of his successful political campaign.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump.

Through his company, Trump owns billions of dollars worth of real estate and golf courses in the United States and abroad.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nWealth is no longer a de facto prerequisite for the presidency, but thanks to the lucrative opportunities afforded to those with the title “ex-president,” wealth for those who have finished their term may be a guarantee.\n\nSeveral presidents went into debt after their time in office, but that may never happen again. Recent presidents have received multi-million dollar offers for the rights to their memoirs about life in the Oval Office. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly inked a deal worth over $60 million for the rights to their book.\n\nNet worth is always difficult to calculate, especially when comparing figures across four different centuries. In the early days of America, land ownership had significant social and political value, meaning those with the most land typically also had the most wealth.\n\nU.S. presidents have been anywhere from some of the wealthiest people in the country to being quite poor. Their wealth, however, does not seem to have an impact on the quality of their presidency. George Washington would have hundreds of millions of dollars in today’s money. Abraham Lincoln never had much money and spent much of his life doing odd jobs before getting into politics. Both are regarded as great leaders and influential figures in American history.\n\n24/7 Wall St. analyzed the finances of U.S. presidents based on historical sources. The figures are adjusted for inflation to December 2017 levels, the most recent level available. We have accounted for hard assets such as real estate, estimated lifetime savings based on work history and inheritance. We also considered annual salaries, incomes earned from royalties on books, ownership of companies, yields from family estates, and other forms of income.\n\nFor deceased presidents, the ranking is based on peak net worth, or how much a president’s combined assets were worth at the time in their life when they were the richest. Many presidents became impoverished or even went into debt after their time in office. For living presidents, the estimate is based on current figures.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

More buses arrived outside the vice president’s residence later Saturday evening. A CNN team saw migrants being dropped off, with some migrants wearing only T-shirts in the freezing weather. They were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church.\n\nAmy Fischer, a volunteer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network, which has been receiving migrants sent to DC since the spring, said the organization had been prepared for Saturday night’s arrivals, having been informed about it earlier by an NGO working at the border in Texas.\n\nThe arrivals included asylum seekers from Ecuador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia, according to Fischer, who told CNN the buses were supposed to go to New York but were diverted to DC due to the weather. Busloads of migrants have been arriving in Washington weekly since April.\n\n“The DC community has been welcoming buses from Texas anytime they’ve come since April. Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different,” Fischer said. “We are always here welcoming folks with open arms.”\n\nSAMU First Response, a nonprofit that has been assisting migrants since the buses began coming to Washington earlier this year, was also on the ground Saturday night helping arrivals. The organization’s managing director, Tatiana Laborde, described the stunt as “extremely inhumane,” but said, if done properly, it could provide a road map to easing tensions at the southern border.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Two ways to look at it': Nonprofit director on Abbott's decision to bus migrants to Harris' house 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\n“What they’re seeing is much worse than what we see here. The three buses are just a small portion of what they experience on a day to day,” Laborde said in an interview with Sara Sidner on “CNN This Morning” on Monday.\n\n“If things like this are done in a coordinated and humane manner, it could really be a good option for those border towns that are struggling,” she added.\n\nLaborde said most migrants were aware of the buses’ destinations, and she said about 60% were headed to New York, either to shelters or to stay with friends and family. She described this as “a pattern we’ve been seeing over the past couple months.”\n\nMigrants from Central and South America wait near Harris' residence in Washington, DC, after being dropped off on September 15, 2022.

Greg Abbott had sent buses of migrants north, including to a location outside Harris’ home. CNN has reached out to Abbott’s office for comment on the latest arrivals.\n\nThe White House, however, put the blame on the Texas governor, calling it a “cruel, dangerous, and shameful stunt.”\n\n“Governor Abbott abandoned children on the side of the road in below freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve without coordinating with any Federal or local authorities,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement.\n\n“As we have repeatedly said, we are willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions, like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office, but these political games accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger,” Hasan said.\n\nAbbott is one of at least three Republican governors who have taken credit for busing or flying migrants north this year to protest the Biden administration’s immigration policies. He previously confirmed in September that his state had sent the buses to Harris’ residence at that time.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the person who spoke about her group being prepared for the migrant arrivals.

He has worked as a systems architect for the Department of Defense, has advised the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy.\n\nHe gives the impression that he thrives on solving problems by analyzing the systems they're in, studying the people, enlisting everyone in identifying priorities, as well as qualifying workers to answer employer needs, finding unusual solutions such as teaming with a business to build a hotel on campus or letting learners from other countries virtually sit in the same class, through technology, with U.S. students.\n\nMore:With URI president David Dooley retiring in June, search for successor underway\n\nMore:URI embroiled in controversy over professor's comments about transgender individuals\n\nMore:A less invasive option: URI researchers have developed a saliva-based COVID test\n\nOf URI, he said the quadrangle is amazing and he loved how students interact with it.

Elements that weigh the heaviest in determining a university's rank are just what educators want emphasized, he said. And he apparently takes rankings as a challenge or a measure of progress. He could see a straight line from URI to the top 100, he said.\n\nCurious about how to keep students engaged so they forget about dropping out, he said he helped bring about a study that gave one group of students the best professors and the best schedules, and kept them together as they advanced.\n\n\"The retention rate had a huge increase,\" he said. The study then tried to provide the favored students with an opportunity to make up for any gaps.\n\nHe also advocated for giving students a chance during college to adjust to the person they're becoming.\n\n\"We've worked to allow students to have an opportunity to improve.\"\n\n\"Why URI?\", asked Jeannette E.

How their shapes were determined provides insight into how the United States became a nation like no other.\n\n24/7 Tempo has taken a look at how each state got its shape. We reviewed materials such as Mark Stein’s book “How the States Got Their Shapes” to find out how each state’s contours fit into the grand puzzle that is the United States of America.\n\nAccording to Stein, the most important influences that determined the shapes of the states were the American Revolution, the construction of railroads, the proposal for the Erie Canal, and the issue of slavery.\n\nThe American Revolution helped to define the shapes of the original 13 colonies. The outlines of the earliest states were often shaped by geographic boundaries, such as rivers. These are the oldest historic towns in every state.\n\nMy pandemic obsession:Why some of us have turned to compulsive shopping (and how to stop)\n\nStimulus checks sent to 156M Americans, including Social Security beneficiaries and 'plus up' COVID payments\n\nThe original 13 colonies vary in shape and size. This did not please Thomas Jefferson, who suggested that Congress create future states equal in size based upon latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\nThe construction of cross-country railroads and the Erie Canal helped dictate the contours of states where those modes of transport traversed.\n\nThe issue of slavery also helped shape states in the territory that was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The Missouri Compromise of 1818 solidified the practice of determining state boundaries in the region based on where slavery was legal.\n\nThe two largest contiguous states, California and Texas, determined their own borders because of the political power they wielded and the concern that they might secede from the U.S. if a territorial dispute arose. As it turned out, Texas did end up seceding from the Union. Here’s how your state was founded.\n\n1. Alabama\n\n► Population: 4,887,871\n\n► Size (square miles): 50,645\n\n► Capital: Montgomery\n\n► Founded: Dec. 14, 1819 (22nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Edmund Pettus Bridge\n\nAlabama's boundaries were created in colonial times. In March 1663, King Charles II of England created the Carolina colony out of the larger colony of Virginia and placed the southern limit of the new colony at the 31st parallel, now Alabama's southern boundary with Florida. Georgia was created out of the Carolina colony, and Alabama would emerge from Georgia. Alabama got access to the Gulf of Mexico in 1804, the year after the Louisiana Purchase. That was when the U.S. announced that the area between the Mississippi River and the Perdido River in what was part of what had been called West Florida -- and was owned by Spain -- was claimed by the United States. That area that bordered the Gulf of Mexico would become part of southern Alabama.\n\n2. Alaska\n\n► Population: 737,438\n\n► Size (square miles): 570,641\n\n► Capital: Juneau\n\n► Founded: Jan. 3, 1959 (49th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Denali (formerly Mount McKinley)\n\nAlaska and Hawaii are the only two states that do not share a border with any other part of the U.S. Alaska is surrounded by the Arctic and Pacific oceans on its North, South, and West sides. Alaska's 1,538-mile eastern border runs along Canada's Yukon territory and British Columbia province. Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. in 1867. Russia and the British were engaged in a proto-Cold War at the time, and Russia decided to sell the territory that became Alaska to the U.S., which supported the Russian cause, instead of Canada, which was under British control at that time. The border between Alaska and Canada runs along the 141st Meridian.\n\n3. Arizona\n\n► Population: 7,171,646\n\n► Size (square miles): 113,594\n\n► Capital: Phoenix\n\n► Founded: Feb. 14, 1912 (48th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Grand Canyon\n\nArizona's current shape came to be in 1863, nearly 50 years before the area became a state. Arizona and New Mexico were split into separate territories when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Arizona Organic Act during the Civil War as a way to outlaw slavery in the new western areas the U.S. controlled. Its western border is marked by the Colorado River and its southern border was determined a decade earlier by the 1853 Gadsden Purchase in which the U.S. purchased a vast swath of land from Mexico.\n\n4. Arkansas\n\n► Population: 3,013,825\n\n► Size (square miles): 52,035\n\n► Capital: Little Rock\n\n► Founded: June 15, 1836 (25th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hot Springs National Park\n\nArkansas borders Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east, Louisiana to the south, and Texas and Oklahoma to the west. An act of Congress in 1819 created the state's northern boundary along the 36 parallel from the Mississippi River to the St. Francis River, then up the river to create the Missouri bootheel.\n\nArkansas' boundary between Tennessee and Mississippi was established after independence from England in 1795. Arkansas' boundary with Louisiana was also established when the Louisiana Purchase was divided in 1804 between the District of Orleans and the District of Louisiana. The 1819 treaty with Spain established Arkansas' western boundary after the Louisiana Purchase, and the border between Arkansas and Texas was set as running north from the Sabine River in Louisiana to the south bank of the Red River.\n\n5. California\n\n► Population: 39,557,045\n\n► Size (square miles): 155,779\n\n► Capital: Sacramento\n\n► Founded: Sept. 9, 1850 (31st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hollywood sign\n\nAside from its western border, which is the Pacific Ocean, California set its northern border along the 42nd parallel and the southern border was settled by the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo with Mexico. There was some sentiment among Californians to set the eastern boundary east of Salt Lake City, but others believed the federal government would not allow a state of that size. The northeast corner of the state was determined as where the 42nd parallel meets the 120th meridian, which includes the Sierra Mountains. California also could not extend eastward because Mormon settlers were already looking to establish their own territory.\n\n6. Colorado\n\n► Population: 5,695,564\n\n► Size (square miles): 103,641\n\n► Capital: Denver\n\n► Founded: Aug. 1, 1876 (38th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Pikes Peak\n\nColorado began as a rectangular state when Congress created its territorial boundaries in 1861. The borders were established between 37th and 41st parallels, and the 25th and 32nd longitudes. The area was taken from what would become Kansas, Utah, Nebraska, and New Mexico. The state became less of a rectangle later because of errors by surveyors.\n\n7. Connecticut\n\n► Population: 3,572,665\n\n► Size (square miles): 4,842\n\n► Capital: Hartford\n\n► Founded: Jan. 9, 1788 (5th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mark Twain House\n\nThe original charter creating Connecticut's border issued by King Charles II in 1662 would have allowed Connecticut to claim most of Rhode Island, eastern Long Island, and all territory west to the Pacific Ocean. That was until New York was established by a patent to the Duke of York in 1664 and Connecticut lost claim to Long Island as a result. The western of the state border was settled in 1682, and Connecticut and Massachusetts resolved their border in 1826.\n\n8. Delaware\n\n► Population: 967,171\n\n► Size (square miles): 1,948\n\n► Capital: Dover\n\n► Founded: Dec. 7, 1787 (1st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mason Dixon Marker\n\nThe borders of Delaware, the nation's first state, were created as a result of the resolution of disputes between the state and with Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey. Delaware was deeded to William Penn from the Duke of York in 1682. Penn was granted all the lands west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile circle beginning in New Castle. The southern border was created by Maryland and Pennsylvania surveyors in 1751. The western border was determined by surveys by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon of Mason-Dixon boundary fame in 1765. The Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean form the eastern border.\n\n9. Florida\n\n► Population: 21,299,325\n\n► Size (square miles): 53,624\n\n► Capital: Tallahassee\n\n► Founded: March 3, 1845 (27th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Castillo de San Marcos\n\nSpanish explorers first came to Florida in the 16th century, and the Florida Panhandle once stretched to the Mississippi River. Spain claimed to own the territories around New Orleans, but the U.S. also claimed ownership because of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. By 1819, most of this disputed land with Spain was in American possession via the Adams-Onis Treaty, making Florida part of the U.S. Over time, the border of the panhandle shifted eastward. Florida's northern boundary with Georgia is marked by a large mound of dirt called Ellicott's Mound, near the headwaters of the St. Mary's River. In 1859, Georgia and Florida appointed surveyors Gustavus J. Orr and B. F. Whitner to complete a survey of the border, and the Orr-Whitner line was accepted by Florida in 1861 and Georgia in 1866 as the boundary.\n\n10. Georgia\n\n► Population: 10,519,475\n\n► Size (square miles): 57,513\n\n► Capital: Atlanta\n\n► Founded: Jan. 2, 1788 (4th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Ebenezer Baptist Church\n\nGeorgia, founded by James Oglethorpe in 1732, defined its northeastern boundary as the beginning of the headwaters of the Savannah River. Georgia's southern boundary with Florida is marked by a large mound of dirt called Ellicott's Mound, near the headwaters of the St. Mary's River. In 1859, Georgia and Florida appointed Gustavus J. Orr and B. F. Whitner to complete a survey of the border. The Orr-Whitner line was accepted by Florida in 1861 and Georgia in 1866 as the boundary. Georgia's western boundary was established following an agreement over a land fraud dispute in the early 19th century.\n\n11. Hawaii\n\n► Population: 1,420,491\n\n► Size (square miles): 6,423\n\n► Capital: Honolulu\n\n► Founded: Aug. 21, 1959 (50th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Diamond Head\n\nHawaii was shaped by nature, in this case volcanic activity. The Hawaiian Islands were formed by a hot spot -- where Earth's tectonic plates come together and sometimes create a volcano -- in the middle of the Pacific Plate. British explorer James Cook arrived in Hawaii in 1778, and just over 100 years later, the U.S. made Hawaii a territory in 1898. The islands became the 50th state to join the Union.\n\n12. Idaho\n\n► Population: 1,754,208\n\n► Size (square miles): 82,643\n\n► Capital: Boise\n\n► Founded: July 3, 1890 (43rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Silver City\n\nIdaho's borders changed many times throughout the mid-1800s before finally giving the state its distinctive shape we know today. The land that makes up present-day Idaho was part of the Oregon Territory that was established in 1848 (the territory also included present-day Oregon, Washington, and parts of Montana and Wyoming). Five years later, Idaho's panhandle became part of the newly-designated Washington Territory. When Oregon became a state in 1859, it had the same borders as it does today, giving Idaho much of its western border.\n\nAfter gold was discovered in Idaho in 1860, miners began moving east to the area. Concerned about the growing mining country, Washington Territory managed to create the Idaho Territory in 1863, and its western border was established along the 117th Meridian. Idaho eventually obtained its current shape after losing some of its land when the Montana Territory was established in 1864, and it used the Bitterroot Mountains as a boundary, and the Wyoming Territory was formed in 1868.\n\n13. Illinois\n\n► Population: 12,741,080\n\n► Size (square miles): 55,518\n\n► Capital: Springfield\n\n► Founded: Dec. 3, 1818 (21st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Wrigley Field\n\nIllinois' shape was determined by the issue of slavery. When it was a territory, the northern border of Illinois went east-west from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Pope, the Illinois Territory congressional delegate, introduced an amendment to the act of statehood that would eventually move the boundary farther north, adding 8,500 square miles. Pope wanted to keep Chicago in Illinois to strengthen links with eastern states and said a planned canal connecting the Illinois River to Lake Michigan could bring commercial opportunities to Illinois. In 1825, the Erie Canal opened, linking Lake Erie and all the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York. Congress accepted Pope's amendment, changing Illinois' destiny forever. Moving the borders farther north would also diminish the state's connection with slave states.\n\n14. Indiana\n\n► Population: 6,691,878\n\n► Size (square miles): 35,826\n\n► Capital: Indianapolis\n\n► Founded: Dec. 11, 1816 (19th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company\n\nIndiana's northern boundary was created by the Enabling Act of 1816 that moved the state's border 10 miles north of the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan. This provided access to the Great Lake. Indiana would continue to have boundary disputes with Ohio and Michigan until the latter became a state in 1837. The Ohio River forms the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky, though the exact border was up for dispute until the Supreme Court settled the matter in 1980. The Wabash River forms the western border of Indiana.\n\n15. Iowa\n\n► Population: 3,156,145\n\n► Size (square miles): 55,857\n\n► Capital: Des Moines\n\n► Founded: Dec. 28, 1846 (29th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Terrace Hill\n\nIowa was originally supposed to be much larger than it ended up being. As Missouri was already a state, Iowa's southern border was fixed. Its original border proposal would have extended the state up to what is now the Twin Cities of Minnesota and set its eastern edge along the Mississippi River and its western edge along the Missouri River.\n\nThe territory, like many others in the mid-1800s, was forever changed by the fight over slavery. Northerners wanted Iowa and other states in the area to be small and numerous to increase the number of anti-slavery senators from new states, while Southerners wanted the opposite. Eventually, the two sides compromised, moving Iowa's northern border farther south and allowing the rivers to serve as the longitudinal boundaries.\n\n16. Kansas\n\n► Population: 2,911,505\n\n► Size (square miles): 81,758\n\n► Capital: Topeka\n\n► Founded: Jan. 29, 1861 (34th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Monument Rocks National Natural Landmark\n\nKansas might have been much bigger than its current size had the proposed larger territory gotten congressional approval. Its western boundary would have extended to the Rocky Mountains in the middle of what is now Colorado, and the northern boundary would be set at the Platte River. The battle between \"Big Kansas\" and \"Little Kansas\" supporters was eventually decided in \"Little Kansas\" favor as a result of the Wyandotte Constitution, which created the state of Kansas.\n\n17. Kentucky\n\n► Population: 4,468,402\n\n► Size (square miles): 39,486\n\n► Capital: Frankfort\n\n► Founded: June 1, 1792 (15th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Churchill Downs\n\nKentucky broke away from Virginia in 1792 and became the 15th state in the Union. The original border between Virginia and North Carolina was set by the British in the colonial era at 36'30\" north latitude and extended to the Mississippi River. However, subsequent surveying teams placed the boundary north by as many as 12 miles. This led to disputes between the two states that were resolved in 1820.\n\nA funky part of Kentucky's geography is The \"Kentucky Bend.\" Also called \"New Madrid Bend,\" it is part of Kentucky encircled on the north, east, and west by the Mississippi River, with the southern part bordering Tennessee. These 30 square miles of Kentucky were cut off from the rest of the state because of surveyor errors and earthquakes that shifted the river.\n\n18. Louisiana\n\n► Population: 4,659,978\n\n► Size (square miles): 43,203\n\n► Capital: Baton Rouge\n\n► Founded: April 30, 1812 (18th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Bourbon Street\n\nLouisiana became part of the U.S. as the result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. At the time, its territory spanned from the Gulf of Mexico to part of present-day Canada and from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. The River Sabine was set as the western boundary between Louisiana and Texas as outlined in the Louisiana Constitution of 1812. The Mississippi River forms Louisiana's eastern border with Mississippi. The northern border with Arkansas starts at 33 degrees north latitude and the south borders the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n19. Maine\n\n► Population: 1,338,404\n\n► Size (square miles): 30,842\n\n► Capital: Augusta\n\n► Founded: March 15, 1820 (23rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Portland Head Lighthouse\n\nMaine was split off from Massachusetts and admitted as a state in 1820 to offset the admission of slaveholding Missouri. Its border with Canada was heavily disputed for decades. The border was not well-defined in the treaty that ended the Revolutionary War, so the U.S. and the British compromised on the state's current boundary in 1842.\n\nWith most of its border running along Canada or the Atlantic Ocean, Maine's only American neighbor is New Hampshire. Though a 1740 decree from King George II supposedly set the border between them in the middle of the Piscataqua River, New Hampshire claimed that all of Portsmouth Harbor belonged to it and not Maine, forcing the Supreme Court to settle the dispute in 2001 in Maine's favor.\n\n20. Maryland\n\n► Population: 6,042,718\n\n► Size (square miles): 9,707\n\n► Capital: Annapolis\n\n► Founded: April 28, 1788 (7th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Fort McHenry National Monument\n\nMaryland has one of the most unusual shapes of any state. Though the state is small, it stretches 352 miles from Ocean City on the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains. A unique feature is the state's panhandle, which in some parts is 1 mile wide, separating Pennsylvania from West Virginia. The Mason-Dixon line, drawn by English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, created the 233-mile boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Potomac River splits Virginia and Maryland. The borders of the two were determined in colonial times by various charters, agreements, and several Supreme Court rulings.\n\n21. Massachusetts\n\n► Population: 6,902,149\n\n► Size (square miles): 7,800\n\n► Capital: Boston\n\n► Founded: Feb. 6, 1788 (6th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Faneuil Hall\n\nThe boundary between Massachusetts and Rhode Island is a part of the original delineation of the territory granted to Sir Henry Roswell during the reign of King Charles I in the late 17th century. It has been a source of dispute for more than 200 years and has gone to the Supreme Court twice. Massachusetts' current northern boundary with New Hampshire was surveyed in 1741. The state's border with Connecticut was set by a joint commission authorized by acts passed by both states in 1905. The state's present boundary with New York was approved by Massachusetts in 1901 and New York nine years later.\n\n22. Michigan\n\n► Population: 9,995,915\n\n► Size (square miles): 56,538\n\n► Capital: Lansing\n\n► Founded: Jan. 26, 1837 (26th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Michigan Stadium\n\nMichigan joined the United States as part of the larger territory America gained from Great Britain after the American Revolution. Eventually Congress created the Indiana Territory, of which Michigan became a part, and then it became its own territory in 1805. Before it became a state, Michigan's legal boundary was established in an 1836 Act.\n\nSince then, Michigan has been involved in boundary disputes with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio but gained territory from Canada. Among the most notable disputes was a clash with Ohio in the 1830s over the Toledo Strip. Michigan hoped to gain Toledo and get access to Lake Erie. The federal government ruled in favor of Ohio. As part of the settlement, Michigan received the western portion of the Upper Peninsula, which had been part of Wisconsin Territory.\n\n23. Minnesota\n\n► Population: 5,611,179\n\n► Size (square miles): 79,626\n\n► Capital: St. Paul\n\n► Founded: May 11, 1858 (32nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mall of America\n\nMinnesota's first boundary was formed before it was even a territory, when the 1783 Treaty of Paris established the border between the U.S. and Canada. The state's southern border was determined by the northern border of Iowa, which was decided in 1846, over a decade before Minnesota's statehood.\n\nThe state's eastern border runs along the Mississippi River, while the northern section of the western partition runs along the Red River. Where the river splits to form the Minnesota River, the boundary begins to run due south to the border with Iowa.\n\n24. Mississippi\n\n► Population: 2,986,530\n\n► Size (square miles): 46,923\n\n► Capital: Jackson\n\n► Founded: Dec. 10, 1817 (20th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Vicksburg National Military Park\n\nIn 1798, Congress created the Mississippi Territory. Its original boundaries consisted of the area between the Mississippi River in the west and Chattahoochee River in the east; the 31st parallel in the south; and the region where the Yazoo River empties into the Mississippi River in the north. In 1804, the northern boundary was extended to the Tennessee state line. Eight years later, the U.S. annexed more land along the Gulf of Mexico Coast. Mississippi shares a long eastern border with Alabama. When Mississippi joined the Union in 1817, Congress used the northwest corner of Washington County in Alabama as the main reference point for setting Mississippi's eastern boundary.\n\n25. Missouri\n\n► Population: 6,126,452\n\n► Size (square miles): 68,741\n\n► Capital: Jefferson City\n\n► Founded: Aug. 10, 1821 (24th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Gateway Arch\n\nMissouri became part of the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The state borders eight states, and its current shape is the result of treaties, wars, and a Supreme Court ruling. The Mississippi River is Missouri's eastern border. The state's southern border is noted for the bootheel in the southeast, the result of lobbying by businessman John Hardeman Walker who wanted a small section of the border shifted farther south for commercial reasons and stay in the new state of Missouri and not in Arkansas Territory. Missouri's western border was put at Fort Osage on the Missouri River as part of a treaty with Native Americans. The northern boundary was a subject of dispute with the Iowa Territory and was not resolved until 1849 by the Supreme Court.\n\n26. Montana\n\n► Population: 1,062,305\n\n► Size (square miles): 145,545\n\n► Capital: Helena\n\n► Founded: Nov. 8, 1889 (41st state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Glacier National Park\n\nMontana owes its contours to Sidney Edgerton, the state's first territorial governor. Montana was split from the massive Idaho Territory that included what is now Idaho, Montana, and part of Wyoming. Lincoln chose Edgerton as chief justice of the Idaho Territory Supreme Court, and Edgerton was picked to make Montana's case to become its own territory. Edgerton proposed making Montana's western boundary along the Bitterroot Mountains, and as a result Montana, gained the riches of the Bitterroot Valley as well as the eventual wealth of Butte.\n\n27. Nebraska\n\n► Population: 1,929,268\n\n► Size (square miles): 76,824\n\n► Capital: Lincoln\n\n► Founded: March 1, 1867 (37th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Scotts Bluff National Monument\n\nThe current area that comprises the state of Nebraska is just a fraction of what the Nebraska Territory used to be. After being organized in 1854, the Nebraska Territory stretched from the Canadian border to present-day Kansas' northern boundary, in between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri River. This area contained parts of modern Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. The territory was gradually whittled down as the federal government introduced the Dakota, Idaho, and Colorado Territories. Nebraska actually grew after becoming a state in 1867, acquiring land from the Sioux Tribe in 1889.\n\n28. Nevada\n\n► Population: 3,034,392,\n\n► Size (square miles): 109,781\n\n► Capital: Carson City\n\n► Founded: Oct. 31, 1864 (36th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Hoover Dam\n\nNevada's borders have expanded since it joined the Union in 1864. The northern border where Nevada meets Idaho and Oregon is the oldest boundary in the West. The first southern boundary of the Nevada Territory was the 37th parallel, about 60 miles north of where Las Vegas is today. Nevada reached this southern point in 1867, when it took a section of the Arizona Territory. The northern section of the western border of Utah Territory, from which Nevada would be created, had been first established shortly after California's entry into the Union in 1850 at the 120th degree of longitude. The diagonal line with California is described by California's constitution as a straight line from the intersection of longitude 120 degrees with latitude 39 degrees down to the Colorado River at latitude 35 degrees.\n\n29. New Hampshire\n\n► Population: 1,356,458\n\n► Size (square miles): 8,952\n\n► Capital: Concord\n\n► Founded: June 21, 1788 (9th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Washington\n\nNew Hampshire's shape traces its history back to the 1620s, when it was made a colonial settlement through a series of grants from the British Monarchy. It was initially smaller, running between the Piscataqua and Merrimack Rivers.\n\nNew Hampshire and Massachusetts engaged in a series of disputes about the size and control of the region throughout the 1600s and early 1700s that were finally settled in the 18th century by a royal decree from King George II. The state's eastern border with Maine was decreed to run through the middle of the Piscataqua River in 1740, but it was in dispute until a 2001 Supreme Court ruling settled it. New Hampshire's border to the west with Vermont was decided in 1790, when the state agreed to allow Vermont to have all lands to the west of the Connecticut River as Vermont was considering whether to join the United States, remain independent, or become a British colony.\n\n30. New Jersey\n\n► Population: 8,908,520\n\n► Size (square miles): 7,354\n\n► Capital: Trenton\n\n► Founded: Dec. 18, 1787 (3rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Washington's Crossing\n\nNew Jersey was originally a Dutch colony founded by Henry Hudson and called New Netherlands. Then the British took over in 1664. They divided the colony in half and gave control of the eastern portion to George Carteret and the western side to John Berkley. The land was renamed New Jersey after the Isle of Jersey of which Carteret had been governor. The Delaware River separates New Jersey from Pennsylvania in the west; the Hudson River provides the eastern border with New York; and the Delaware Bay divides New Jersey from Delaware.\n\n31. New Mexico\n\n► Population: 2,095,428\n\n► Size (square miles): 121,298\n\n► Capital: Santa Fe\n\n► Founded: Jan. 6, 1912 (47th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Palace of the Governors\n\nThe southern border of New Mexico with Mexico was established following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 that ended the Mexican-American War. To organize the lands the U.S. got from Mexico, Congress passed The Compromise of 1850. This established a straight line at 37 degrees latitude north as the territory's northern border. Part of the western border of the New Mexico Territory was the Colorado River. The border in the east between New Mexico and Texas was established by The Compromise of 1850.\n\n32. New York\n\n► Population: 19,542,209\n\n► Size (square miles): 47,126\n\n► Capital: Albany\n\n► Founded: July 26, 1788 (11th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Times Square\n\nAfter the British took the colony of New York from the Dutch, they controlled a region that included present-day New York state, the western half of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and all of Vermont. Present-day New York took shape after Vermont became its own state in 1789 and Connecticut and Massachusetts expanded west. The state has mostly natural river and lake borders to its west and north. New York had a dispute along its southern border with Pennsylvania, which wanted the 43rd parallel latitude as the boundary instead of the 42nd. That would have put Buffalo in Pennsylvania. However, New York prevailed.\n\n33. North Carolina\n\n► Population: 10,383,620\n\n► Size (square miles): 48,617\n\n► Capital: Raleigh\n\n► Founded: Nov. 21, 1789 (12th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Kitty Hawk\n\nAn Atlantic Coastal state, North Carolina's northern and southern boundaries were determined even before the U.S. declared independence. The Carolina Province was split from Virginia by Charles II in 1663 along the 36th parallel. The border was adjusted in 1665 and again in 1728.\n\nNorth and South Carolina were considered to be separate territories before the 1700s, but the dividing line was not made official until 1737. That border was adjusted several times throughout the late 1700s and early 1800s.\n\n34. North Dakota\n\n► Population: 760,077\n\n► Size (square miles): 69,000\n\n► Capital: Bismarck\n\n► Founded: Nov. 2, 1889 (39th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Border monuments on Dakotas border\n\nThe western part of what is now North Dakota was part of the Louisiana Purchase. Its northern boundary with Canada was set at the 49th parallel as determined by the Treaty of Peace in 1818. The Red River comprises the eastern border of North Dakota and separates the state from Minnesota. The western boundary is based on longitudinal measurements and the line is the 27th meridian. The southern boundary split the Dakota Territory into North and South Dakota and is almost 362 miles long.\n\n35. Ohio\n\n► Population: 11,689,442\n\n► Size (square miles): 40,860\n\n► Capital: Columbus\n\n► Founded: March 1, 1803 (17th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame\n\nOhio was the first state created out of the Northwest Territory, so its shape was largely determined by its southern and western neighbors and surrounding bodies of water. Its entire southern border as well as much of its eastern edge run along the Ohio River. The portion of the state border that runs north-south was set by the preexisting border of Pennsylvania. The western border extends north from where the Great Miami and Ohio Rivers meet.\n\nOhio's northern boundary mostly runs across Lake Erie. The rest was supposed to be delineated by an \"east-and-west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan,\" according to Congress in 1787, but lawmakers were using an inaccurate map, so Ohio extends a bit farther north than it was supposed to.\n\n36. Oklahoma\n\n► Population: 3,943,079\n\n► Size (square miles): 68,594\n\n► Capital: Oklahoma City\n\n► Founded: Nov. 16, 1907 (46th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Price Tower\n\nThe borders of Oklahoma, one of the last states to join the Union, were determined by the issue of slavery and relations with Native Americans. The state affixed its western boundary on the 100th meridian in 1930 after a series of failed attempts to find the meridian. The northern border was settled in 1861, when Kansas became a state and lawmakers set the boundary at 37 degrees latitude. The panhandle of Oklahoma -- one of its distinguishing characteristics -- was sold to the federal government in 1850 by Texas. Texas did this because as a slave state, it did not want its northern border to go above the 36 1/2 parallel, which would have violated the Missouri Compromise. Until 1890, when it was attached to Oklahoma Territory, the panhandle was a lawless land. Oklahoma's southern boundary, the south bank of the Red River, was not officially settled until 2000 with the signing of the Red River Boundary Compact.\n\n37. Oregon\n\n► Population: 4,190,713\n\n► Size (square miles): 95,988\n\n► Capital: Salem\n\n► Founded: Feb. 14, 1859 (33rd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Hood\n\nWith tensions rising between the U.S. and Britain, the two countries in 1846 signed a treaty that gave the U.S. all the territory from the 42nd parallel to the 49th parallel and as far east as the Continental Divide. The geographical region was named the Oregon Territory in 1848 and included what are now the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. Oregon joined the Union in 1859 with its current boundaries. Some wanted to limit Oregon's eastward boundary to the Cascade Mountains, but that proposal was rejected.\n\n38. Pennsylvania\n\n► Population: 12,807,060\n\n► Size (square miles): 44,742\n\n► Capital: Harrisburg\n\n► Founded: Dec. 12, 1787 (2nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Independence Hall\n\nOne of the 13 original colonies, Pennsylvania's borders consistently expanded for about a century after the land was chartered to William Penn in 1681. The Delaware River still separates it from its eastern neighbors New York and New Jersey, as it did in the 1600s. Pennsylvania added vast swaths of land throughout the 1700s, expanding westward until finally acquiring the northwestern part of the state that runs across Lake Erie in 1792.\n\nPennsylvania was involved in an eight-year border dispute with its southern neighbor Maryland. The dispute was finally settled with the establishment of the Mason-Dixon line, which would go on to become the dividing line between North and South in the Civil War.\n\n39. Rhode Island\n\n► Population: 1,057,315\n\n► Size (square miles): 1,033\n\n► Capital: Providence\n\n► Founded: May 29, 1790 (13th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Flying Horse Carousel\n\nRhode Island was created after the Puritans in Massachusetts Bay Colony banished Roger Williams, who set up a colony founded on religious tolerance. The Connecticut-Rhode Island border was disputed all through the 17th and 18th centuries. Both states' legislatures ratified a survey taken in 1840. Another survey begun in 1940 and interrupted by World War II was not ratified by either state's lawmakers, though Rhode Island has long observed it. Connecticut continues to honor the 1840 survey. The border of the Ocean State was originally established by surveyors Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffery, who had been tasked with marking Massachusetts Bay Colony's southern border, a straight line west from a point three miles south of the southernmost branch of the Charles River. Block Island Sound is on Rhode Island's southern border.\n\n40. South Carolina\n\n► Population: 5,084,127\n\n► Size (square miles): 30,060\n\n► Capital: Columbia\n\n► Founded: May 23, 1788 (8th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Fort Sumter\n\nSouth Carolina and North Carolina were one colony until 1729, when they separated and became their own colonies. Border disputes arose, and the two colonies created a commission to settle the dispute. They agreed that the boundary should begin 30 miles south of Cape Fear and a straight line should run northwest until it reached the 35th parallel and then go west to the Pacific Ocean. Surveying errors forced a correction and the boundary was moved 17 miles north of the 35th parallel and west to the Saluda Mountains. The southern boundary had been established by the second Carolina charter in 1665, placing that border near where Daytona Beach, Florida, is today. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east of South Carolina.The Savannah River comprise the western border between South Carolina and Georgia.\n\n41. South Dakota\n\n► Population: 882,235\n\n► Size (square miles): 75,811\n\n► Capital: Pierre\n\n► Founded: Nov. 2, 1889 (40th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Mount Rushmore\n\nSouth Dakota's eastern boundaries were set by the states that came before it. The northern section of its eastern border runs along the Bois de Sioux River, then goes due south and meets up with the Big Sioux River. Its southern border was determined by the northern border of Nebraska, which was set at the 43rd parallel to the Missouri River.\n\nThe dividing line of the Dakotas is set at the northern tip of the Coteau des Prairies plateau.\n\nSouth Dakota's western edge was set at the 104th meridian back when it was part of the Dakota Territories.\n\n42. Tennessee\n\n► Population: 6,770,010\n\n► Size (square miles): 41,234\n\n► Capital: Nashville\n\n► Founded: June 1, 1796 (16th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Graceland\n\nLandlocked Tennessee borders eight states. At one time, the Mississippi River was its western border. But the river has meandered, causing confusion with neighboring states Missouri and Arkansas. The Supreme Court has ruled that the western border of Tennessee can't be shifted because of geographic changes caused by river movements.\n\nAs for the southern border, in 1818 Georgia and Tennessee appointed University of Georgia professor James Camak and Tennessee mathematician James Gaines to survey the border of their respective states. When Congress voted to make Tennessee a state in 1796, it set the boundary between Georgia and Tennessee at 35 degrees north latitude. Camak and Gaines put the border about a mile south of 35 degrees north. That border continues west to the Mississippi River.\n\nTo the east is North Carolina, from which northeast Tennessee separated in the 18th century. Its northern border was created during the colonial era when the British Crown declared that the border between North Carolina and Virginia would be 36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude. That line continued west when Kentucky and Tennessee were established.\n\n43. Texas\n\n► Population: 28,701,845\n\n► Size (square miles): 261,231\n\n► Capital: Austin\n\n► Founded: Dec. 29, 1845 (28th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Alamo\n\nThe independent Republic of Texas once stretched into present-day Wyoming before it was pared down for statehood. A treaty with Spain mandated that Texas' eastern border traces the path of the Sabine River until the 32nd parallel, then due north to the Red River, west to the 100th meridian, then north again.\n\nTexas' southern boundary was set along the Rio Grande after the land was acquired through the Treaty of Velasco in 1836 after Texas won the war for its independence. After nine years of independence, Texas began the process of becoming a U.S. state. It got its distinctive shape after the Compromise of 1850, when it sold some of its northwestern land area in exchange for the U.S. taking on its massive debt load.\n\n44. Utah\n\n► Population: 3,161,105\n\n► Size (square miles): 82,169\n\n► Capital: Salt Lake City\n\n► Founded: Jan. 4, 1896 (45th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Monument Valley\n\nThe land where Utah is now located was ceded from Mexico in 1848. Mormon settlers moved there from New York years before to try to leave the relatively new U.S. The Mormons wanted to form their own state, called Deseret, but Congress shrunk the land and named it Utah. From 1850 to 1861, the Utah Territory included all of present-day Utah, as well as parts of Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado.\n\nAfter silver was discovered in Nevada, it became its own state. The same happened when gold was discovered in Colorado and in Wyoming. Utah's border with Wyoming was established along the 111th meridian, giving Utah its distinctive shape and the borders it now has to this day.\n\n45. Vermont\n\n► Population: 626,299\n\n► Size (square miles): 9,216\n\n► Capital: Montpelier\n\n► Founded: March 4, 1791 (14th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Rudyard Kipling House-Naulakha\n\nVermont had been part of the colony of New York, but when the king of England ruled in favor of New York over land disputes, Vermonters declared themselves a republic in 1777. Led by Ethan Allen, the fledgling nation even tried to join the province of Quebec during the Revolution but was rejected. After the war ended, Vermont paid New York money to settle land claims, and it was admitted to the Union in 1791. The Vermont-New Hampshire border meanders along the Connecticut River that forms a major part of Vermont's eastern border. Vermont's southern border with Massachusetts is basically a straight line on the 42nd latitude and its shortest boundary.\n\n46. Virginia\n\n► Population: 8,517,685\n\n► Size (square miles): 39,490\n\n► Capital: Richmond\n\n► Founded: June 25, 1788 (10th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Arlington National Cemetery\n\nVirginia was the first colony settled by the English in 1607, and since that time, its size has changed. In 1792, nine counties called the Kentucky District of Virginia broke away from Virginia and became their own state. In 1863, the western counties of Virginia split to become the state of West Virginia. The Potomac River divides Virginia and Maryland. The borders between the two were determined in colonial times by various charters, agreements, and several Supreme Court rulings. Virginia also has territory on the southern part of the Delmarva peninsula because of aggressive claims by Surveyor General of Virginia Edmund Scarborough in the late 17th century. The Virginia-North Carolina border was delineated in 1665 as the 36° 30\" parallel of latitude and was resolved in two major joint survey efforts in 1728 and 1749. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east of Virginia.\n\n47. Washington\n\n► Population: 7,535,591\n\n► Size (square miles): 66,455\n\n► Capital: Olympia\n\n► Founded: Nov. 11, 1889 (42nd state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Space Needle\n\nSitting at the northwestern tip of the contiguous U.S., Washington's northern border with Canada and western boundary with the Pacific Ocean were in place well before it became a state. The area that is now Washington joined America as part of the Oregon Territory in 1848.\n\nIn just a few years, people in the northern part of the Oregon Territory felt neglected by their legislators, and in 1853, Congress allowed for the creation of the Washington Territory, which includes present-day Washington, Idaho's panhandle, and part of western Montana. Washington was reshaped to its current borders in 1863, when the Idaho Territory was established, though it would have to wait more than 25 more years as a territory before gaining statehood.\n\n48. West Virginia\n\n► Population: 1,805,832\n\n► Size (square miles): 24,038\n\n► Capital: Charleston\n\n► Founded: June 20, 1863 (35th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: The Greenbriar\n\nIn 1863, the western counties of Virginia split to become the state of West Virginia. The state's eastern border runs along the Mason-Dixon Line. The state has two panhandles. The Northern Panhandle was formed by the Ohio River along West Virginia's western border. The southern section of the Eastern Panhandle was created after West Virginia separated from Virginia. To the north, the Potomac River and the North Branch of the Potomac River create a natural border.\n\n49. Wisconsin\n\n► Population: 5,813,568\n\n► Size (square miles): 54,157\n\n► Capital: Madison\n\n► Founded: May 29, 1848 (30th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Lambeau Field\n\nWisconsin was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and it used to make up a vast landmass in the Midwest when it was called the Wisconsin Territory. That area included present-day states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and the eastern half of the Dakotas. The Upper Peninsula was part of the Wisconsin Territory, but the federal government took that away from Wisconsin in 1836 and gave it to Michigan to help resolve a dispute with Ohio. Chicago would have been in Wisconsin had not Illinois lobbied to move its border northward. The Mississippi River forms a section of Wisconsin's western border, while Great Lakes Superior and Michigan border Wisconsin to the north and east, respectively.\n\n50. Wyoming\n\n► Population: 577,737\n\n► Size (square miles): 97,093\n\n► Capital: Cheyenne\n\n► Founded: July 10, 1890 (44th state to join)\n\n► Famous landmarks: Old Faithful\n\nUnlike many territories that later became states, Wyoming's shape never changed throughout its time as a territory. The rectangular state was made from parts of the Dakota, Idaho, and Utah territories and used longitudinal and latitudinal lines to mark its borders. The state's borders run along the 104 and 111 degrees west longitude lines and 41 and 45 degrees north latitude lines.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Regardless of what it is called, the American flag is one of the most recognizable symbols of any country in the world, and the inspiration for our national anthem.\n\nThe first official national flag was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. The resolution read: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.” Each star represented a state and each stripe represented the 13 colonies that declared independence from Great Britain. The colors of the flag were inherited from British flags and have no official meaning.\n\nSince the founding of the United States in 1776, there have been 27 different versions of the flag featuring the stars and stripes. Each new flag represented the addition of one or more states as the United States grew westward to fulfill what it believed to be its manifest destiny of expansion in North America.\n\nFourth of July:Fireworks sales to top $1.3 billion for this year\n\nAs Independence Day nears, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at how each of these 27 flags got that way. We reviewed sites such as usflagdepot.com and various history websites to find out how each state was added to the Union, thus affixing a new star to the flag.\n\nOf the 27 versions of the United States flag, nine flew for only about a year, reflecting the rapid expansion of the nation. Though we have not had a new star since 1960 – Hawaii – we may not be done adding stars. American-owned. territories Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, might be considered for statehood.\n\n1. Thirteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1777 ~ 1795\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797)\n\nThe 13-star flag officially became the U.S. flag on June 14, 1777, and the date is celebrated every year in the United States as Flag Day. Though there is no conclusive proof, Francis Hopkinson, a congressman from New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, is credited with designing the flag. Each star and stripe represented a former British colony.\n\n2. Fifteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1795 ~ 1818\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797), John Adams (1797-1801), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), James Madison (1809-1817), and James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nTwo stripes and two stars were added to the flag when Vermont and Kentucky became the 14th and 15th states in 1791 and 1792, respectively. The 15-star flag would last for 23 years and five presidents would serve under it. This flag inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" our national anthem, after Key saw the flag continue to fly over Fort McHenry following a British bombardment during the War of 1812.\n\n3. Twenty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1818 ~ 1819\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nWith the westward expansion of the United States and the addition of more states, Congress realized that adding stripes to the flag would be impractical. So Congress passed the Flag Act in 1818, restoring the original 13-stripe design and unveiling the flag with additional stars on July 4. Five stars were added to represent five new states: Tennessee (1796), Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), Indiana (1816), and Mississippi (1817). The 20-star flag became the official flag on April 13, 1818, and it was the first of nine flags to only last about a year.\n\n4. Twenty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1819 ~ 1820\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nJust over a year after the twenty-star flag was introduced, the United States added Illinois to the Union, boosting the number of states to 21. Illinois, where future president Abraham Lincoln began his political career, was admitted on Dec. 3, 1818.\n\n5. Twenty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1820 ~ 1822\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nThe number of U.S. states rose to 23 with the admission of Alabama in 1819 and Maine in 1820. The flag became the official U.S. flag on July 4, 1820, and would last two years. President James Monroe was the only president to serve under this flag as well as the previous two flags.\n\n6. Twenty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1822 ~ 1836\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825), John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), and Andrew Jackson (1829-1837)\n\nThe flag expanded to 24 stars with the addition of Missouri in 1821. Missouri, a slave state, was admitted as part of the Missouri Compromise, which sought to achieve a balance of free and slave states during the antebellum period. The compromise included the admission of Maine, a free state, which had separated from Massachusetts and become a state the previous year.\n\n7. Twenty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1836 ~ 1837\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) and Martin Van Buren (1837-1841)\n\nArkansas joined the Union as a slave state on June 15, 1836. Less than a month later, its star was included in the U.S. flag, pushing the state total to 25. Arkansas was part of the Louisiana Purchase and carved out of what became the Missouri Territory to become its own territory.\n\n8. Twenty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1837 ~ 1845\n\n• Who was president: Martin Van Buren (1837-1841), William Henry Harrison (1841), John Tyler (1841-1845), and James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nMichigan was admitted to the Union in 1837 as a free state to help maintain the balance between slave and free states. Michigan's admission had been thwarted because of a border dispute with Ohio – which had been admitted as a state in 1803 – but President Andrew Jackson helped Michigan save face by awarding it land from the Upper Peninsula, and then it was granted statehood, boosting the number of states to 26.\n\n9. Twenty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1845 ~ 1846\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nFlorida, a former possession of the Spanish empire, was admitted to the Union in 1845, raising the total number of U.S. states to 27. It would not remain in the Union for long: Florida would secede in 1861.\n\n10. Twenty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1846 ~ 1847\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIn 1846, the flag would undergo another change, this time because of the admission of Texas. Before becoming the 28th state, the Lone Star state had broken away from Mexico in 1836. It was an independent republic before joining the Union and becoming the biggest state in land mass in the contiguous 48 states.\n\n11. Twenty-Nine Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1847 ~ 1848\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIowa was admitted to the Union on Dec. 28, 1846, as a free state to maintain the balance between free and slave states during the antebellum period. Its star was added to the U.S. flag the following July 4. Originally part of the Louisiana Purchase, Iowa grew dramatically because of its rich farmland. Iowa had been established as a U.S. territory in 1838.\n\n12. Thirty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1848 ~ 1851\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849), Zachary Taylor (1849-1850),and Millard Fillmore (1850-1853)\n\nWisconsin became a state on May 29, 1848, adding the 30th star to the U.S. flag less than two months later. Not all residents of Wisconsin were enthusiastic about statehood. They had rejected it four times previously because they were concerned statehood would mean higher taxes.\n\n13. Thirty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1851 ~ 1858\n\n• Who was president: Millard Fillmore (1850-1853), Franklin Pierce (1853-1857), and James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nThe Gold Rush that began with the discovery of the precious metal in 1848 helped fast-track California to statehood in 1850. California became the 31st star on the American flag the following July 4. The admission of California fulfilled America's manifest destiny of a nation extending from sea to sea.\n\n14. Thirty-Two Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1858 ~ 1859\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nOn the eve of the Civil War, Minnesota was admitted to the Union on May 11, 1858, and represented as the 32nd state on the flag less than two months later. Minnesota was admitted as a free state.\n\n15. Thirty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1859 ~ 1861\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861) and Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nAmerica's expansion surged to the Northwest with the admission of Oregon on Feb. 14, 1859, adding a 33rd star to the flag the following July. Oregon, which had become a U.S. territory in 1848, was admitted as a free state, though its first two senators, Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith, were proslavery Democrats.\n\n16. Thirty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1861 ~ 1863\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nKansas became the 34th state to join the Union. Voter fraud over whether the state would be admitted as a slave state or a free state delayed its admission. Kansas joined the Union on Jan. 29, 1861 as a free state, just as the southern states were seceding, and its star was represented on the flag six months later.\n\n17. Thirty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1863 ~ 1865\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) and Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe onset of the Civil War did not halt the admission of states to the Union. The western part of Virginia was pro-Union and contained many abolitionists. It split from the rest of the state, which had seceded. President Abraham Lincoln was unsure about dividing Virginia and admitting the western portion as a separate state. He agreed to its admission on the grounds that West Virginia's action was an act of secession in favor of the Constitution. West Virginia joined the Union on June 20, 1863, and a new flag on July 4 included the 35th state.\n\n18. Thirty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1865 ~ 1867\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe Civil War was engulfing the nation when Nevada was admitted as the 36th state on Oct. 31, 1864, and the 36th star on the U.S. flag the following July. Nevada was pro-Union and President Abraham Lincoln saw Nevada's admission as a way to buttress support for the war. To speed up statehood, Nevada sent its entire state constitution to Washington, D.C. – 175 pages – by telegram.\n\n19. Thirty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1867 ~ 1877\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869), Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), and Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881)\n\nNebraska was the first state to be admitted to the Union after the Civil War. After the Civil War, rapid economic development accelerated by the growth of railroads helped speed Nebraska's admission to the Union on March 1, 1867, becoming the nation's 37th state and the 37th star on the flag.\n\n20. Thirty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1877 ~ 1890\n\n• Who was president: Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881), James A. Garfield (1881), Chester A. Arthur (1881-1885), Grover Cleveland (1885-1889), and Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nColorado, a territory that partially came with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, became the 38th state to join the Union on Aug. 1, 1876. Colorado's admission had been vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, but President Ulysses S. Grant approved it. The 38-star flag would fly for 13 years.\n\n21. Forty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1890 ~ 1891\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nA flurry of state admissions boosted the star total on the flag to 43 by July 4, 1890, as statehood filled out the United States in the high plains and the far west. Five states were admitted to the Union and five stars added to the flag: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington all in 1889, and Idaho in 1890.\n\n22. Forty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1891 ~ 1896\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) and Grover Cleveland (1893-1897)\n\nSix states were admitted to the Union when President Benjamin Harrison was president, more than any other president. Wyoming was the last of the six, boosting the number of stars on the flag to 44. Wyoming was admitted on July 10, 1890, even though it was 5,000-people short of the 60,000-person requirement to become a state.\n\n23. Forty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1896 ~ 1908\n\n• Who was president: Grover Cleveland (1893-1897), William McKinley (1897-1901), and Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)\n\nUtah became a state on Jan. 4, 1896, and the 45th star on the flag later that year. However, the area that would become Utah had been part of the United States since the nation received the territory as part of a treaty that ended the Mexican-American War in 1848. Mormons settled in the area, and their practice of polygamy prevented Utah from becoming a state until Mormons renounced polygamy in the state constitution.\n\n24. Forty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1908 ~ 1912\n\n• Who was president: Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) and William H. Taft (1909-1913)\n\nOklahoma became the first state to be admitted to the Union in the 20th century, on Nov. 16, 1907, taking its place on the U.S. flag as the 46th star the following year. The United States had used the Oklahoma territory to resettle Native American people, but by the late 19th century, Texas ranchers began moving northward and the federal government decided to open up the territory for homesteaders.\n\n25. Forty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1912 ~ 1959\n\n• Who was president: William H. Taft (1909-1913), Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921), Warren Harding (1921-1923), Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929), Herbert Hoover (1929-1933), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945), Harry S.Truman (1945-1953), Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961)\n\nThe southwestern territories of New Mexico and Arizona were the last to join the 48 contiguous states. New Mexico became the 47th state on Jan. 6, 1912, and Arizona attained statehood on Feb. 14, 1912. The 48-star flag flew longer than any other flag before it, 47 years, and eight presidents served under it.\n\n26. Forty-Nine Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1959 ~ 1960\n\n• Who was president: President Eisenhower (1953-1961)\n\nAlaska became the first non-contiguous territory to become a state on Jan. 3, 1959, and the 49th star on the U.S. flag. Alaska, which was purchased from Russia in 1867, is 2.5 times the size of Texas, the second-largest U.S. state. The 49-star flag was the last of the nine flags to fly for just one year.\n\n27. Fifty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1960 ~ present\n\n• Who was president: Presidents Eisenhower (1953-1961), John F. Kennedy (1961-1963), Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969), Richard M. Nixon (1969-1974), Gerald R. Ford (1974-1977), Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) George H.W. Bush (1989-1993), William Clinton (1993-2001), George W. Bush (2001-2009), Barack Obama (2009-2017), Donald Trump (2017-present)\n\nHawaii is the 50th state, and joined the Union on Aug. 21, 1959.

The split followed reports last month that Hollande had been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet.\n\nBut the two leaders seemed intent on noting how far the two countries have come since the days of American lawmakers rebuking France for its opposition to the Iraq war by ordering their burgers with a side of \"freedom fries.\"\n\n\"A decade ago, few would have imagined our two countries working so closely together in so many ways. But in recent years our alliance has transformed,\" Obama and Hollande wrote in a joint Op-Ed published in the Washington Post and Le Monde on Monday.\n\nWhite House officials on Monday highlighted the two countries' cooperation in reaching an interim agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program through the P5+1 as well as their ongoing effort to end the three-year-old civil war in Syria. Even before Hollande began his presidency last year, the Obama administration coordinated closely with the French on Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nFrance has also played a key role in dealing with security challenges in combating the rise of Islamic militants in places like Mali and the Central African Republic, with airlift and other logistical support coming from the Untied States.\n\nThe two leaders will also spend plenty of time talking about economic issues, including ongoing negotiations for a major U.S.-European Union trade deal, and France's ailing economy.\n\nBoth Obama and Hollande are facing declining popularity -- in Hollande's case, he has the lowest favorability rating of any modern French president.\n\nAlthough U.S. unemployment has fallen to 6.6%, Obama has repeatedly acknowledged that too many Americans are struggling, and he has made addressing income inequality a central focus of his remaining time in office.\n\nHollande faces a more difficult situation, with French unemployment hovering around 11% and 0.4% economic growth in the last quarter.\n\nThe two returned to Washington on Monday night, where Hollande was to have dinner with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hollande and Obama will meet again at the White House and hold a joint news conference.\n\nHollande will also be honored with a luncheon by Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday afternoon, and the official visit will be wrapped up with a state dinner on Tuesday night at the White House.\n\nWhite House executive chef Cristeta Comerford and White House pastry chef William Yosses appear ready for the challenge of cooking for the leader of the gastronomic epicenter of the universe and have come up with their \"Across America\" menu for the dinner.\n\nIf the dinner isn't impressive enough, the evening's entertainment should be.

Both were experienced military men. President Thomas Jefferson had chosen Lewis to lead an expedition up the Missouri River. Lewis, with Jefferson’s approval, chose Clark. It was a multi-task expedition, but one of the main objectives was to seek out a water route to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe expedition had been more than a year in the planning when they arrived at the confluence of the great rivers.\n\nThe two American commanders planned to make their winter camp on the western shore of the Mississippi River near the mouth of the Missouri River in what was then still the Louisiana Territory, an 828,000-square-mile swatch of North America claimed by France and governed by Spain but soon to be transferred to the United States for the bargain basement price of $15 million.\n\nBut Carlos Dehault Delassus planned otherwise.\n\nDelassus was the Spanish commander in St. Louis. And although the Louisiana Purchase had already been agreed to between the United States and France, the Spanish had been granted control of the territory and Delassus had not been formally notified by his government of the purchase, and thus would not allow the American expedition to establish a camp west of the Mississippi. Lewis and Clark abided by the Spanish commander’s decision. They stayed on American soil, which meant staying east of the Mississippi.\n\nClark, who had the responsibility of establishing the military camp while Lewis attended to business at the territorial courthouse in Cahokia and nearby St. Louis, led his group to the River Dubois, which met the necessary requirement of being in United States territory. They landed near the mouth of the river on the south shore, across the Mississippi from where the Missouri emptied into it. Clark explored the landscape and determined it suitable for their winter camp, which he later designated Camp River Dubois. Final preparations for the Lewis and Clark Expedition had begun.\n\n‘Boot camp’ of the Lewis and Clark expedition\n\nIt was by most accounts a rough-and-tumble affair. The men were young, spirited and restless. The winter military camp was rigid and boring. Clark apparently had no hesitancy in administering discipline. He knew the trip ahead would be difficult. Success and survival would hinge on the functioning of an organized, well-disciplined military unit. He and Lewis were determined to form one.\n\n“I would consider this place the boot camp of the Lewis and Clark expedition,” said Brad Winn, site manager for the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site just off Highway 3 near here. The property includes an impressive 14,000-square-foot visitor’s center and a replica of the original Camp River Dubois, which is hardly larger than a subdivision residential lot.\n\n“He (Clark) had to muster together what we today call the Corps of Discovery,” Winn added. “They had to learn to trust each other. And they had to learn to trust the captains. It all comes together at Camp Dubois.”\n\nThe exact location of the original camp is unknown, although Winn says it is likely underwater, having been swallowed by the shifting Mississippi.\n\n“The confluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi in 1803 was about 5 miles north of where it is today,” Winn said. “Over the past 200 years the Mississippi River has moved east and the Missouri River has moved south. We don’t know for sure where the camp was. What we can say with certainly is that the original site was east of the Mississippi River.”\n\nMore:American beginnings: The source of the Mississippi River\n\nClark, who would become the expedition’s mapmaker, took regular sextant readings (he stationed the instrument on a stump from where timber had been cut to construct the fort) and kept copious notes. But he was early in the cartography learning curve.\n\nFrom Clark’s notes, Winn said, the original site was likely about 1 1/8 miles north of the state historic designated site.\n\n“As good a cartographer as he would become, Clark was a little off in his latitudinal and longitudinal readings,” Winn said.\n\nThe current display includes a reconstructed fort. The fort area was closed for maintenance and storm damage repair the day I visited, but a walk around revealed it to be a roughhewn affair, but one designed with order and symmetry. It was built to military specifications of the early 19th century.\n\nWinn notes that the fort’s size and its building placement are estimates based on Clark’s notes and sketches of the compound, which Winn describes as “doodling.”\n\n“Clark’s sketches of the fort are just that: sketches,” he said. “But we know some things about how it was laid out from military requirements of the day.”\n\nThe winter camp was also a time of fine-tuning who would be included in the expedition. Men were added; others were dismissed. Clark also apparently employed practical solutions to thorny problems. Winn said military regulations permitted the hiring of a civilian to provide laundry services. Clark employed a local woman for the work. Army regulations also required she be provided with housing, food and medical care. Clark assigned men who had been fighting the job of building the washerwoman’s lodging, effectively forcing them to work together, communicate and cooperate.\n\nClark and about 40 men departed Camp Dubois on May 14, 1804. Clark noted the event in his journal: “I Set out as 4 oClock P.M. in the presence of many of the Neighbouring inhabitents, and proceeded on under a jentle brease up the Missourie.”\n\n“This is where it began,” Winn added.\n\nLewis, who was wrapping up affairs in St. Louis and would join the group in the village of St. Charles a few days later, agreed, recording in his notes from May 1804, “The mouth of the River Dubois is to be considered as the point of departure.”\n\nThe Lewis and Clark State Historic Site is located just off Highway 3, on the Illinois side of the Mississippi and across the river from where the Missouri joins the Mississippi. Hours of operation vary by season.

Barnes\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nImagine gathering with a few hundred thousand of your closest friends for days filled with live, pulsating music performed by local, regional and international acts on 12 stages, all under the warm Louisiana sun (with a cool breeze blowing, if you're lucky). Fest-goers grab strangers’ hands at the Fais Do-Do Stage and dance in the grass to Cajun and Zydeco music. They set up their chairs for a full day of fun at the Congo Square Stage and delight in seeing local favorite Big Freedia drop the beat, amongst other things. Last weekend, they sang along and danced with Bonnie Raitt, Common, Sting, Rod Stewart and Jack Johnson. They ate local dishes like soft shelled crab po boys, Cajun jambalaya, muffulettas and Crawfish Monica, and washed them down with rosemint iced tea and a mango freeze for something sweet and refreshing.\n\nThis was exactly the scene last weekend when the 49th New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival kicked off in the Crescent City, continuing the celebration of New Orleans’ 300th anniversary this year.\n\nPrior to its discovery by the French in 1718, the area that we know today as New Orleans was home to Native Americans of the Woodland and Mississippian cultures. In the 300 years since New Orleans’ settlement, the city was under both French and Spanish rule until it was sold to the USA in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In the mid-19th century, New Orleans was the wealthiest city in the country, with a population of 170,000, and in the early-1900s, the city became the birthplace of jazz. After World War II, New Orleans became a popular tourist destination, and revelers spill into the streets year-round.\n\nNew Orleans certainly does know how to throw a party, and its tricentennial is a great reason to keep the party going all year long. Earlier this year the festivities got under way with Mardi Gras, and more than 130 festivals are scheduled through 2018 to keep the festivities alive. A few highlights include Wednesday at the Square Concert Series, Jazz in the Park, the Tremé/7th Ward Arts and Culture Festival, New Orleans Pride, the Cajun-Zydeco Festival, Satchmo Summerfest, Voodoo Music + Arts Experience, and plenty more.\n\nThe entire city is joining in the celebration, and there’s even been a song penned to commemorate the tricentennial. Jeremy Davenport, who has performed in his namesake Davenport Lounge at The Ritz-Carlton New Orleans since 2000, wrote a love song to the city for its 300th anniversary, “One Way Ticket to New Orleans.” While listening to Jeremy perform, sip on the specially-crafted 1718 Cocktail with French and Spanish ingredients such as VSOP Privilege cognac (French), Old Overhold (American’s oldest brand of straight rye whiskey) and Pedro Ximenez Sherry (Spanish), with a dash of Peychaud’s bitters (New Orleans) for good measure.\n\nFor even more music, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival continues through the weekend with headliners Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, Lionel Richie, Lyle Lovett and His Large Band, Aaron Neville, Beck, Sheryl Crow, LL Cool J, Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit, The Revivalists, Aerosmith, Anita Baker, Cage the Elephant, Jack White, Smokey Robinson, Savion Glover, Buddy Guy and plenty more.

A treaty with Spain in 1819 reaffirmed that boundary.\n\nIt was in the early 1920s when a dispute between Texas and Oklahoma led to a U.S. Supreme Court case that commissioned two surveyors, Cols. Arthur Kitter and Arthur Stiles, to conduct a survey along the south bank of the Red River. Words like avulsion, accretion and erosion were used to determine where the boundary between the states begins and ends.\n\nThe gradient boundary — the midpoint between the south cut bank and vegetation line and the normal flow of water in the river — was said to be where the border lies.\n\nIn some instances, according to landowners, BLM border monuments signifying where federal lands end and private ownership begins is a mile or more away from the Red River and the south cut bank.\n\nThe dispute eventually led to the lawsuit, pitting private landowners, counties, the Texas General Land Office and the state against the BLM, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the United States and federal officials. The suit was filed in November 2015 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Wichita Falls Division.\n\nThe trial was originally set to begin in July, but Judge Reed O'Connor approved a request to push the date to Sept. 25.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/26/tourism-secretary-no-more-mall-cops-state-museums/83543212/", "title": "Tourism secretary: No more 'mall cops' at state museums", "text": "Greg Hilburn, ghilburn@gannett.com\n\nBATON ROUGE — Do you want “Barney Fife” guarding Napoleon’s death mask at the Cabildo museum in New Orleans, the site of the Louisiana Purchase transfer ceremony in 1803?\n\nLouisiana Tourism Secretary Robert Barham said he wants “real police” protecting the state’s most valuable exhibits at the Cabildo and the other state museums under his watch.\n\nSenate Bill 277 by Sen.

Israel bombed one of its nuclear reactors in 1981. Iraq spent the better part of the decade fighting Iran. Yet the country was united. Shiites fought alongside Sunnis against their Persian enemies. After the war ended, the United States invaded Iraq to reverse Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait, providing Iraqis with another external enemy for another decade.\n\nIraq no longer faces imminent invasion by its neighbors. Yet it may be breaking apart. Ditto Syria. A social scientist writing in 1996, Michael Desch, predicted such a turn of events. He noticed that external threats led to internal cohesion, and when the threat was removed, the cohesion broke down, sometimes violently.\n\nTake the United States' own history. After removing French and British threats with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, followed by pushing Spain out of Florida in 1819, acquiring Texas in 1845 and defeating Mexico in the 1840s, the U.S. was left without enemies along its borders. Not coincidentally, argues Desch, the country soon descended into civil war.\n\nThe same could be said of 19th century Europe. From the Napoleonic Wars through the 1850s' Crimean War, Europe was more or less at peace with itself. But internally, its countries were riven by factionalism. Russia saw the Decembrist revolt. Greece rebelled against its Ottoman overseers. Later, popular revolutions raged across the continent.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Yugoslavia was held together by a strongman, Tito, but also by the threat of European war. Once the Berlin Wall fell, the fractious Croats, Bosniacs and Serbs all went at each others' throats.\n\nSimilarly, for decades Arab countries such as Iraq, Syria and Egypt were ruled by secular strongmen who used the threat of external enemies — Islamist radicals, Israel and so forth — as the glue to keep fractious societies together. With the threat of foreign invaders fading, the Arab Spring arrived in 2011.\n\nThis is not to downplay the seriousness of war but rather to emphasize an overlooked consequence of peace: A lower threat environment could lead to weaker national bonds. But with foreign wars going out of fashion in the U.S., that has reduced the external-threat environment and arguably with it, national unity. We still rally around the flag during World Cup games, but rarely are we going off \"in search of monsters to destroy.\"\n\nWe might expect countries to engage in more diversionary wars. If Iraq and Israel went to war tomorrow, that might unite Sunni and Shiites. One theory to explain China's recent saber-rattling in the South China Sea is to keep its fractious Muslim and Tibetan minorities in check. The inflated boogeyman of the U.S. has done wonders to hold North Korea's hermetic kingdom together for half a century. And Russia has become less fractionalized internally since annexing Crimea and demonizing the West. The uglier things look outside the tent, the better things looks inside it.\n\nThe lesson for policymakers is not that too much peace is a bad thing. Rather that once foreign threats are removed or neutralized, religiously and ethnically diverse countries used to hostile environments abroad can often turn inward and become unglued. Hence, we should not be all that surprised by the civil wars in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOne might even argue that the divisiveness we are witnessing in the U.S. is evidence of this theory, as the country is tearing itself apart over how (and how much) the federal government should rule. This tension re-emerged only after the post-9/11 threat of Islamist radicalism began to recede.\n\nCoincidence?

The roaring rivers and babbling brooks? The majestic elk and bighorn sheep? Or maybe just the chance to drive at more than\n\n2 miles above sea level and throw snowballs in mid- summer?\n\n\"There's nowhere else where you can see so much,\" says Jessica Blank, a nurse from Kentucky. \"I wanted to come and see somewhere wild and mountainous.\"\n\nLike many visitors, Blank found herself drawn to the wide range of options at the park, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. This spring, Blank spent two nights camping in a remote area of the park, watching one day as a magpie taunted a coyote.\n\n\"It's incredible, the things you can see,\" she says.\n\nAmerica acquired the land on which the park sits as part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, and visitors have long appreciated its towering peaks and abundant wildlife. Silver prospectors sought their fortune in Lulu City, and farmers tapped the Colorado River for irrigation, diverting water across the Continental Divide to nurture crops near Denver.\n\nRocky, as the park is known locally, officially became a national park on Jan. 26, 1915, with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson, following years of lobbying by naturalist and lodge owner Enos Mills. At the time, many private buildings dotted the new park's landscape, and roads were primitive.\n\nAs with many Western parks, the Great Depression spurred major changes as the Civilian Conservation Corps erected lodges and built roads and trails. While there had been a road across the Continental Divide, it wasn't designed for automobiles in the way the purpose-built Trail Ridge Road was.\n\nTrail Ridge, the highest paved road in the country, takes drivers on a 4,000-foot climb to nearly 11,500 feet above sea level, connecting Estes Park with Grand Lake. Opened in 1932, the highway to the sky winds through meadows and pine forests before breaking out through wind-twisted trees known as krummholz onto windswept tundra, providing 360-degree views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.\n\nThe road is a popular day trip for summer visitors, who can easily drive from Denver to the park's eastern edge, up and across the Continental Divide for lunch in Grand Lake before returning as the sun sets behind the Rockies. Unlike many national parks, Rocky was never served by a railroad, which park officials say helped make it one of the nation's first auto-focused national parks.\n\n\"It was designed to be accessible almost right from the beginning,\" says park superintendent Vaughn Baker. \"(Visitors) can do it from their car, and they certainly don't have to get out. It's a good introduction to wilderness. We hope the next step is to get out of the car, and maybe it's a short walk out to the tundra or to a lake.\"\n\nOf course, accessible doesn't equal tamed. Visitors often have to wend their way through elk herds at the park's entrance, and bighorn sheep unexpectedly hop off ledges onto the road in front of cars. In short, this park that last year got 3.4 million visitors is still dominated by Mother Nature.\n\n\"What better way to connect with kids than for them to see wildlife?\" Baker says.\n\nThe park's grandeur makes us all feel small. Longs Peak towers to 14,259 feet, all of which can be conquered by well-prepared hikers willing to start their trek in the pre-dawn darkness. They clamber through the boulder field and then the Keyhole before making the final ascent to the massive flat-topped peak. Longs is no easy hike, yet it draws thousands of trekkers and climbers every year from around the world.\n\nThe intimidating Longs is far from the park's only hike. Visitors can take easy walks along brooks that were snow just a few hours before, or hike alongside the very first miles of the Colorado River as it begins its long path to Mexico. You can even walk to abandoned gold mines or the now-defunct Lulu City.\n\nBaker says the park's beauty comes from its combination of accessibility and wilderness. With an easy drive, visitors can look down upon valleys and meadows where few feet have trod.\n\nThe park's 100th anniversary is an opportunity for people to get re-acquainted with Rocky, which has long been a draw for families on vacation, Baker says. Hotels, lodges and campgrounds surround the park, and there's also camping and lodging inside its boundaries.\n\n\"People have made connections to this special place over generations,\" he says. \"It's that classic Rocky Mountain experience.\"\n\nJackie Keller of Omaha rediscovered that classic experience on a recent weekend. Keller grew up in the Midwest but used to visit Rocky as a kid. She brought her husband, Pat, for his first visit while they were in the area with family.\n\n\"It's been a long time since I've seen the mountains,\" Keller said as she and Pat snapped photos of the snow-covered peaks looming above them. \"I'll drive nine hours to be in this beauty for a long weekend.\"\n\nPat Keller listened quietly as his wife described her childhood visits to the park, and as she decided, right then and there, to lobby to move their annual family reunion west from Nebraska.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it in my life,\" he said as he watched high clouds blow past snow-capped peaks. \"It's mesmerizing.\"\n\nAbout the park\n\nSize: 265,770 acres\n\nVisitors: 3,434,751 in 2014\n\nEstablished: 1915\n\nHistory: For thousands of years, Native Americans used trails to cross the Continental Divide in the area of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Hayes Presidential Library and Museums.\n\n“In the Spirit of the People: James Monroe's 1817 Tour of the Northern States” will be on display in the museum auditorium from August 1 to 20. It will be the third special exhibit featured at the Hayes Presidential Library and Museums this summer. Admission is included with the price of a regular museum ticket.\n\nJames Monroe became the fifth president of the United States in March 1817. Three months later, he embarked on a 15-week tour of the northern states, traveling up the East Coast from Washington D.C. to Portland, Maine; west to Detroit; and back to Washington via Ohio, western Pennsylvania and Maryland, totaling some 2,000 miles.\n\nWhile modern-day presidents are readily recognizable by almost every American, this was not true 200 years ago. Monroe’s predecessors rarely traveled, and there was no electronic media continually broadcasting the president’s image or the sound of his voice.\n\nMonroe’s tour created a national sensation. Americans came out by the thousands, thrilled by the opportunity to see the president, and newspapers across the country gave day-by-day accounts of his progress.\n\nPolitical differences were forgotten as Americans of both parties joined together in grand celebrations marked by parades, speeches, dinners, balls, receptions and concerts. A Boston newspaper coined the phrase “Era of Good Feelings” to describe the national unity created by Monroe’s tour. The term became the catch phrase of his presidency.\n\nMonroe’s two terms in the White House (1817-1825) capped a public service career that included combat service in the Revolutionary War; state and federal legislative offices; the governorship of Virginia; diplomatic missions to France, Great Britain and Spain; and stints as secretary of state and secretary of war.\n\nAs a special U.S. envoy to France in 1803, he played a decisive role in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase Treaty. During his presidency, Monroe signed the Missouri Compromise to deal with the growing sectional divide over slavery (1820); granted diplomatic recognition to emerging South American Republics (1823-24); and issued the Monroe Doctrine, declaring the western hemisphere closed to further European colonization (message to Congress, 1823). He capitalized upon the success of his 1817 northern tour by visiting the Chesapeake region in 1818 and the southern states in 1819.\n\nThis exhibit also has relevance to President Rutherford B. Hayes in that President Hayes was the first sitting president to travel to the West Coast. He also traveled through the south, and his trips were meant to help unite the country. The exhibit is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\n“In the Spirit of the People” consists of 10 full-color vinyl banners containing images, quotations and captions to present a history of Monroe’s northern tour and convey a sense of the exuberance it generated. The first three banners introduce viewers to Monroe and offer an overall summary of the tour. The next six banners focus on specific locations that Monroe visited, with one banner dedicated to each. The final banner offers interactive educational links as well as credits for the exhibit's sponsorship and preparation.\n\nThe exhibit is a joint project of The James Monroe Museum and The Papers of James Monroe, both of which are administered by the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The museum, founded in 1927 by Monroe descendants, is a National Historic Landmark housing the largest single collection of artifacts and archives related to the fifth president.\n\nThe Papers of James Monroe is a publication project that has produced six volumes to date of selected official and personal correspondence pertaining to Monroe's long career in public service.\n\nFor information, call 419-332-2081, or visit rbhayes.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/16"}]}

From big-city stadiums to small-town high school fields, those broad stripes and bright stars are the expected musical preamble to our ballgames.\n\nNow, with the Dallas Mavericks not playing the national anthem at home games this season, there is a new national debate stirring. Some believe the melody means respect for the fallen among our military and police. Others believe it means the entirety of the American experience. The answer often depends on the ear of the beholder.\n\nColin Kaepernick, then of the San Francisco 49ers, began a protest movement in the NFL in 2016 that used the anthem as a moment of maximum impact to call attention to social injustice. In 2017, former President Donald Trump called for firing players — he called them SOBs — who protest during the anthem.\n\nHow did the dawn’s early light and twilight’s last gleaming become so politicized?\n\n“National anthems are political,” Marc Ferris tells USA TODAY Sports. He is the author of \"Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America’s National Anthem.\" And he knows the history of how our anthem, born of war, became intertwined with our sporting life.\n\n“Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,” Ferris says, “a sort of war without death.”\n\nNANCY ARMOUR:Mark Cuban's decision to not play national anthem before games will surely draw outrage. But it’s long overdue.\n\nThe song is about a battle in the War of 1812. The first documented time that it was played at an American sporting event came at a baseball game in 1862, during the Civil War. The tradition of playing it at sports events got a dramatic boost at the 1918 World Series, during World War I. And the tradition of playing it before games was popularized during World War II.\n\n\"We’re a patriotic country and we’re different from the rest of the world in that respect,” Ferris says. “As we grew and as we prospered, people wanted to show their patriotism.”\n\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the song in 1814 and it became the nation’s de facto anthem not long after. Congress made it official in 1931. World War I vets had been lobbying for it for years.\n\nFerris says that in one respect Yankee Doodle Dandy should be the national anthem because it dates to the nation’s roots in the Revolutionary War. “But the Star-Spangled Banner is a better piece of music,” he says. “It’s got gravitas. It’s got history. It’s got emotional resonance.”\n\nAnd bombs bursting in air. North and South wrestled over which side could claim the song during the Civil War.\n\n“The North won the tug of war,” Ferris says. “The irony is that the South’s anthem, Dixie, was written by an anti-slavery Northerner whereas the Star-Spangled Banner, the anthem of the North, was written by a slave-holding Southerner whose family supported the Confederacy” long after Key died in 1843.\n\nKey's song was played at some baseball games in the 1890s, often with great pomp, Ferris says, but the World Series in 1918 offered a star-spangled moment. Babe Ruth’s Boston Red Sox opened in Chicago against the Cubs. The game came 17 months — and 100,000 American deaths — after the U.S. entered the war to end all wars. During the seventh-inning stretch, a military band spontaneously played the country’s still-unofficial anthem.\n\nRed Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, on furlough from the Navy, saluted. Other players put hands over hearts. The crowd, already on their feet to stretch, began to sing along. The New York Times reported the song’s final bars were met by “thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm.”\n\nWhen the Series moved to Boston, the Red Sox played the song during pregame festivities and paired it with the introduction of wounded soldiers. Ferris credits the theatrical move to Red Sox owner Harry Frazee. “He thought, ‘I’m an impresario, I’ll show those Midwesterners in Chicago how it’s done,’ ” Ferris says.\n\nThe song did not yet catch on at all games for the simple reason that owners didn’t hire bands except for big events like the World Series or Opening Day. Sound systems, in place by World War II, changed that.\n\n“The anthem was heard everywhere” during the second world war, Ferris says. “Before the opera, before the movies, before the theater.”\n\nAnd, of course, before all manner of sports. Most teams continued to play the anthem in the surge of postwar patriotism. Ferris says the Cubs stopped playing it after the war but picked it up again in 1967, during the Vietnam war, and have played it since.\n\nAmid the upheaval of Vietnam, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle enforced a policy that players stand at attention during the anthem, with helmets tucked under their arms. They were not to talk, chew gum or move their feet.\n\nThe government cannot restrict speech under the First Amendment. Employers can. Today’s “owners could say to the players, ‘If you take a knee, you’re gone,’ ” Ferris says. “But of course they won’t.

It's been kicked around like a political football ever since it was written.\"\n\nA native of Scarsdale, Ferris, 51, spent nearly two decades writing and researching the 328-page book, which was published in August by Johns Hopkins University Press. He'll be signing copies Thursday at Anderson's Book Shop in Larchmont.\n\nThe idea came to him in 1996, Ferris said, when he was a graduate student at Stony Brook University. Three years later, armed with a fellowship from the Smithsonian Institution, he traveled to Baltimore and Washington, D.C., to dig through archives.\n\nHe was struck by the fact that the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" which became an instant hit after Key's lyrics were printed in Baltimore newspapers, didn't become our official national anthem for 117 years. Plus, most Americans don't exactly praise the tune.\n\nIt's forgotten today, Ferris said, but for much of the 19th-century the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was one of several songs vying for the title of unofficial national anthem. \"Hail, Columbia\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" were the two others.\n\nThen as now, many Americans complained Key's tune is too militant and too hard to hit the high notes. They also took exception to the fact that Key cribbed the melody from from \"To Anacreon in Heaven,\" an old English drinking song.\n\nKey owned slaves and his entire family fought for the Confederacy. But during the Civil War, Northerners adopted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as an anthem of hope and national unity. Meanwhile, Southerners sang \"Dixie,\" which was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett — an Ohio-born, anti-slavery songwriter.\n\n\"It's one of the greatest ironies in America history,\" Ferris said.\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, the anthem become a powerful rallying point for groups like the Veterans of Foreign War and Daughters of the American Revolution during debates over the national character and democratic ideals.\n\nIn 1916, President Woodrow Wilson decreed the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military events. Congress officially declared it the national anthem only in 1931 — a political gesture to win the support of veterans during the depths of the Depression, Ferris said.\n\nIn addition to his passion for history, Ferris is also an avid guitarist who plays in a bluegrass band. One of the things he loves about the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" is that the song is endlessly adaptable to vernacular American musical forms, from Jose Feliciano's singing of the national anthem in 1968 World Series to Jimi Hendrix's wild and wooly Woodstock version.\n\n\"There are many unorthodox versions,\" he said shortly before picking up his Yamaha guitar and strumming away. \"You have swing bands who start jazzing up the anthem. Hendrix isn't the first to do a controversial version.\"\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous suggestions for songs that could replace \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" But none have succeeded.\n\n\"'God Bless America' is not the greatest song,\" Ferris said. \"'America The Beautiful' is kind of wimpy. It's neither here nor there. But the 'Star-Spangled Banner' has history, it's got gravitas.\"\n\nTwitter: @alextailored\n\nIf you go\n\nMarc Ferris will be visiting Anderson's Book Shop, 96 Chatsworth Ave., in Larchmont, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Nov. 20.

Yada yada yada.\n\nBut did you know where the tune comes from?\n\nIt is from a song of – shall we say – questionable character. Some would call it a drinking song. Some would call it worse.\n\n\"The Anacreontic Song\", also called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\", was the anthem of an 18th-century British gentlemen's club. Composed by John Stafford Smith, its original lyrics ran: \"To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full Glee / A few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition.\" (Try singing it to the tune of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\")\n\nAnacreon was a Greek poet. He was known, especially, for drinking songs and erotic poetry. The song is a plea for inspiration in both departments. \"That he their Inspirer and Patron would be.\"\n\nFrom heaven – in the midst of who knows what debauch – Anacreon sends a reply: \"I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine, The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n\nBacchus, as in drink. Venus, as in sex. Basically, this song is a request to a heavenly playboy: \"Will you be the MC of our stag party?\"\n\nThat's what you're singing at the beginning of every football game.\n\nAre banks open on July 4th?

We cheer them in the Bronx. We send the Yanks \"Over There.\" And of course \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" conjures up pictures of George Washington, Valley Forge and the heroes of 1776.\n\nWell, sorry to disappoint. But \"Yankee Doodle,\" the hero of that popular Revolutionary War ditty, was a clod.\n\n\"Doodle\" is 18th-century-ese for \"nincompoop.\"\n\n\"Yankee Doodle came to town / Riding on a pony\" was originally a British song, from the point of view of the Europeans. Look at that ridiculous American!\n\nYankee Doodle then makes himself even more embarrassing by sticking a feather in his cap and calling it \"Macaroni.\" A \"Macaroni,\" in those days, was a dandy, a fop – in line with contemporary prejudice that Italians were effeminate.\n\nBut Yankee Doodle isn't even a fop. He's a wannabe fop. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it Macaroni\" is the equivalent of \"Dyed my hair green and called myself Lady Gaga.\"\n\nJuly 4th at the White House is an annual tradition. Here’s how it started.\n\nFlying on July 4 weekend? Delta has good news for you: No fare difference when rebooking travel\n\n'You're a Grand Old Flag'\n\nThis song might have gotten you into a fight – if you sang it with the original lyrics.\n\n\"You're a Grand Old Flag\" was first published and performed in 1906 as \"You're a Grand Old Rag.\"\n\nIt wasn't meant as an insult. George M. Cohan, the musical comedy writer famous for this, \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" \"Over There,\" and other patriotic tunes, had no beef with the flag. Neither did the old Civil War veteran he had encountered carrying a tattered but much-loved flag – possibly from Gettysburg, where he'd fought. \"She's a grand old rag,\" the man had remarked wistfully.\n\nCohan was taken with the phrase. So much so that he wrote a song about it. And so much so that even when people started complaining (\"You can't call the Stars and Stripes that!\"), he was loath to change the lyric.\n\nHe tried \"You're a grand old flag / Though you're torn to a rag.\" No sale. Finally, reluctantly, he changed it to, \"You're a grand old flag, you're a high-flying flag.\"\n\nWhich is a non-rhyme – but at least it didn't offend the music-buying public. \"You're a Grand Old Flag,\" in sheet-music form, became the first million-selling musical comedy song.\n\nIn other news:Will you have to have to eat your July Fourth hot dog or hamburger without mustard?\n\n'My Country 'Tis of Thee'\n\nYou will have noticed that the tune of this familiar song – a de facto national anthem for many years, until \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became our official one in 1931 – is the same as \"God Save the Queen.\"\n\nWhat you may not know is that the same tune is used in dozens of countries.\n\nIt's the national anthem of Liechtenstein: \"Oben am jungen Rhein.\" It's the royal anthem of Norway: \"Kongesangen.\" The Swiss call it \"Rufst du, mein Vaterland\" (it's their former national anthem). Germany and Russia have their own versions.\n\n“All the brass instruments and big drums in the world cannot turn 'God Save the King' into a good tune,\" remarked George Orwell in 1943. Clearly the minority opinion.\n\nBut did you know that, even in America, there were two versions of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\"?\n\nThere's the one you grew up with. And there was an abolitionist version, popular in the 1840s, which you probably did not sing in grade school: \"My native country, thee / Where all men are born free, if white's their skin…\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter was a thing then, too.\n\nHoliday pet care:How to keep your dog calm during fireworks this 4th of July\n\n'The Stars and Stripes Forever'\n\nIf you were at a circus or the theater, and the house band started playing this beloved 1896 march by John Philip Sousa, you knew you were in trouble.\n\nThat march, back in the day, had a very specific meaning. It meant: Get out!\n\n\"The Disaster March,\" as it was known in the trade, was never to be played except in the case of the most extreme emergency. The march was code. The point was to signal the staff, without letting the public know.\n\nThis was the music people heard at the infamous fire at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, according to historian Michael Skidgell (\"The Hartford Circus Fire: Tragedy Under the Big Top,\" 2014). For some, it was the last music they heard. At least 168 were killed that day, and the incident led to Ringling Bros. abandoning the canvas \"big top\" in favor of arenas.\n\nBut it didn't lessen the popularity of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" In 1987, \"The Disaster March\" became the national march of the U.S.\n\n'God Bless America'\n\nThis is the song many people wish was our national anthem – if only because Irving Berlin's tune is easier to sing than \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nBut people have loved \"God Bless America\" ever since Kate Smith introduced it on her Armistice Day broadcast in 1938. Coming on the eve of World War II (it was actually a rewritten version of a song Berlin had penned in 1918, for the previous war, but never published), the song seemed like a national prayer for deliverance in a dark moment. Since then, \"God Bless America\" has been popular in good times and bad. Presidents since Ronald Reagan have invariably ended their speeches with, \"God Bless America.\"\n\nWhere did Irving Berlin get the inspiration for this passionate, transcendent hymn to all things American?\n\nApparently, from a 1906 novelty song called \"When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band.\"\n\nAt least, the first six notes of the chorus are the same as \"God Bless America,\" as music historian Jody Rosen has pointed out.\n\nSuch humorous \"ethnic\" ditties were all the rage in the early 1900s, when Berlin began his career. \"It Takes the Irish to Beat the Dutch,\" \"Come Down to Your Italian Romeo,\" \"Abraham Jefferson Washington Lee\" were some of the more mentionable ones.\n\nBerlin, though Jewish himself, was not above writing \"Yiddle on Your Fiddle Play Some Ragtime.\" So Mose and his nose were probably not unknown to him.\n\nFrom such questionable beginnings came a patriotic treasure. Only in America.\n\nWhat does the Juneteenth flag look like?:Can it be celebrated with July 4th? It's complicated\n\n'This Land Is Your Land'\n\n\"Answer records\" are an old story in pop music. Chuck Berry wrote \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" The Beatles responded with \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" Tenafly's Lesley Gore answered her own hit, \"It's My Party and I'll Cry if I Want to\" with \"It's Judy's Turn to Cry.\" In 1984, the hip-hop hit \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" was followed by \"Roxanne's Revenge,\" \"Do the Roxanne,\" \"The Parents of Roxanne,\" \"Roxanne's a Man\" and at long last \"The Final Word – No More Roxanne (Please).\"\n\nThis is the great tradition that folk singer Woody Guthrie was tapping into when he responded in 1945 to \"God Bless America\" with \"This Land Is Your Land\" – originally titled \"God Blessed America for Me.\"\n\nHe had become tired, he tells us, of hearing \"God Bless America\" everywhere – he felt it was jingoistic. The original lyrics contained verses (often omitted now) critical of capitalism and private property: \"There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / Sign was painted, it said private property / But on the back side it didn't say nothing / This land was made for you and me.\"\n\nThe chorus was meant to be confrontational. This land is made for you and me – not them (millionaires and big business).\n\nIronically this song, with its left-wing lyrics, is now widely viewed as a patriotic anthem equal to \"God Bless America\" – most people, if pressed, could not detect any difference in sentiment. Both were added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in the same year: 2002.\n\nTraveling for July Fourth?:Here are 5 things to know before flying, driving this weekend.\n\nJuly Fourth gas prices:How much will gas cost?

Can't you just wag your tails?\n\n'Only in America'\n\nGet Me Rewrite – Part 2. \"Only in America\" was a No. 25 Billboard hit for Jay and the Americans in 1963. And its sunny optimism struck a chord with lots of people. Cuban immigrants, fleeing Castro, made it a kind of anthem: \"Only in America / Can a guy from anywhere go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire.\"\n\nBut those weren't the original lyrics.\n\nSongwriters Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil originally intended the song for The Drifters, the Black R&B group that had hits with songs like \"Up on the Roof\" and \"On Broadway.\" And the original lyrics were quite different: \"Only in America / Land of opportunity / Can they save a seat in the back of the bus just for me.\"\n\nNo can do, said Atlantic Records – which refused to release a song with such incendiary lyrics.\n\nThe Drifters refused to release the rewritten version. So the original instrumental track was used to back up the white group Jay and The Americans, who could sing the cheerful new words with some conviction.\n\nRelated:5 products to ease PTSD and anxiety during Fourth of July\n\nAs hopefully we will all do this July 4, as \"America the Beautiful,\" \"This Land Is Your Land\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" bring us together in song.\n\nAssuming we can be brought together, these days, by anything.\n\n\"The Fourth of July gives us an opportunity to put aside our disagreements and come together for love of country,\" Gillespie says. \"That's when we see that coming together, rallying together.\"\n\nBoom:The fireworks shortage is over, but prices have exploded this year\n\nJuly Fourth weekend travel:Here are the best and worst times to leave for your road trip", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/07/11/fort-mchenry-birthplace-of-our-national-anthem/2509305/", "title": "Fort McHenry: Birthplace of our national anthem", "text": "Brian Shane\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe birthplace of The Star-Spangled Banner is rich with American history that goes beyond the War of 1812.\n\nFort McHenry was instrumental in securing Baltimore for the Union in the early days of the Civil War, and served as a confederate prison. It was the site of a large Army hospital during the first World War, and was a Coast Guard base during World War II.\n\nIn each of those eras, \"all the soldiers here referenced The Star-Spangled Banner,\" according to Vince Vaise, a National Park Service Ranger and park spokesman at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. \"People who were stationed at Fort McHenry had a real sense of the history of the site.\"\n\nThe night of September 14, 1814, while under British guard on an American truce ship in the nearby Patapsco River, young attorney Francis Scott Key witnessed the nonstop British bombardment of the fort. When American troops emerged victorious in the morning, Key was moved to write about what had witnessed.\n\nThough his poem, titled The Defence of Fort McHenry, had four verses, it was the first that was immortalized as the lyrics to our national anthem.\n\nFort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine opened a new visitors center two years ago, with a Hollywood-quality intro video and other flag-related exhibits.

You can see where the flag-maker actually lived and sewed the iconic flag.

This was also the philosophy of a young lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, in 1813, when he wrote the “Star Spangled Banner”.\n\nKey was on an errand of mercy to release a prominent local physician, (a Dr. Beane), who had been taken prisoner by the British, at Fort McHenry. The officers had decided to let him go, but not until the current battle was over.\n\nHelplessly, Key watched, from a distance, all throughout the night, as that bloody battle in the War of 1812 ensued. His heart was heavy, as there was little hope that these brave, but few, tired fighters for freedom could withstand the strong, well equipped British warhead.\n\nIn the “dawn’s early light” of Sept. 14, Key noticed that the British had stopped firing. He knew that Major Armistad had specifically asked for a huge flag to be flown, “so large, that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance,” if the victory was ours. Key strained to see through the smoke, if the flag was still there.\n\nHe later described his feelings of exquisite gratitude, as he looked across the bay, through the clouds of war. He said, “In that hour of deliverance, and joyful triumph, my heart ‘spoke.’ Such defenders and a country deserve a song.”\n\nHe scribbled the first words of this song, (it was never meant to be just a poem) on a piece of paper, and finished it later, back on shore.\n\nHe showed it to a relative by marriage, Judge Nicholson, who was most impressed with it, and took it to a newspaper, “Baltimore America.” They began to distribute it around Baltimore, making poster-sized copies of it. Each man serving at Fort McHenry gratefully received a copy. Everyone who got it was excited to share it with others.\n\nThe immortal words were put to the music of John Stafford Smith’s “To Anacreas in Heaven,” and thus we have our national anthem.\n\nFrancis Scott Key remained most humble about this great gift. He said, “Let the praise, if any be due, be given not to me. God is the inspirer of that song; and the men who died for the freedoms of this country were the ones who deserve the credit.”\n\nWe all have a destiny to perform, and we were created for higher purposes than we can now even imagine. May we zealously seek for civil ways to love and serve our country.\n\nHappy Birthday, with gratitude to all who have served our nation and its people, in any way.\n\nBebe Green is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Mid-Valley Interfaith Council.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/05/30/indy-500-jimmie-allen-anthem-milo-ventimiglia-honorary-starter/5273058001/", "title": "Indy 500: Jimmie Allen national anthem; '(Back Home Again in ...", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nCountry music artist Jimmie Allen kicked off festivities at the 105th running of the Indianapolis 500, bringing a soulful, soothing twang to his rendition of the \"The Star Spangled Banner.\"\n\nThe pre-race tradition carries even more special meaning this year, as Indianapolis Motor Speedway welcomes fans back after months of uncertainty and planning.\n\nViewers applauded Allen's performance, dubbing it an \"incredible\" rendition and writing on social media that the singer \"crushed\" it.\n\n\"Jimmie Allen just did a wonderful rendition of the National Anthem,\" tweeted user @MichaelMullet13. \"Thank you, Jimmie!\"\n\n\"Okaaaay @JimmieAllen with that National Anthem,\" added @Katelyn19xx with a clapping emoji.\n\nThe Nashville-based country musician was recently named \"New Male Artist of the Year\" by the Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nAllen was applauded for his fashion, too.

The congregation sang spirituals, field songs, freedom songs. The story of emancipation was told in skits, with congregants dressed as heroes such as Tubman, Douglass and Lincoln.\n\nThis was Watch Night, when the faithful waited for the new year as their ancestors had waited for midnight on Dec. 31, 1862. The following day, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves across the South.\n\nLewis, today a congressman from Georgia, never forgot those annual celebrations of freedom by people who couldn't legally check a book out of the public library. He says when he was nearly beaten to death during the Freedom Rides in 1961 and at the Selma march in 1965, \"those stories inspired me to keep going.\"\n\nOver the years and across the land, they helped shape what Alabama State University archivist Howard Robinson II calls \"a common African-American consciousness.\"\n\nThe nation has just re-elected an African-American president who hangs in his Oval Office a signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. This, the executive order's 150th anniversary, is the first major one when black people can fairly be called free.\n\nThe sesquicentennial is being marked by speeches, ceremonies, books, exhibits, conferences and services. You can visit the Smithsonian and see the inkstand Lincoln used when he drafted it; you can go to the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston and see the pen he used to sign it.\n\nBut on this anniversary, no less than its first or its 100th, Americans are still working through why and how the Emancipation Proclamation came into being, what it meant, and what it wrought.\n\nIt's a subject on which Americans have long disagreed. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass said that the date Jan. 1, 1863, was greater even than July 4, 1776. William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of State, called the decree as ephemeral as \"a puff of wind.\" In 1948, Columbia historian Richard Hofstader wrote that it \"had all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading.\"\n\nWhatever you think of it, there is nothing else in U.S. history like the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIt was the product of a most difficult decision by a most complex president during a most crucial conflict. It ordered the largest single confiscation of private property in U.S. history. And before Gettysburg, Appomattox and the Second Inaugural, it ensured Lincoln his spot in the American pantheon.\n\nUnderrated and under-read\n\nEveryone learned in school that the Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves. Only it didn't free all of them in law; it didn't free most of them in fact; and eventually, with the collapse of Reconstruction in the 1870s, it didn't leave many of them materially better off than they were in 1862.\n\nRutgers historian Louis Masur says that because real freedom for the slaves came so long after 1863 and required so much more than one edict, the proclamation is underappreciated, rarely read and widely misunderstood.\n\nSome enduring questions and controversies:\n\nWho was and wasn't freed?\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime order designed and worded by a commander in chief to achieve a limited military aim — weaken the Confederacy — not to end slavery in America or make the former slaves citizens.\n\nIn fact, it freed only slaves in parts of the Confederacy \"in rebellion\" — about 3.2 million of the nation's 4 million slaves. Because they were behind Confederate lines, there was no way to immediately enforce the order.\n\nEmancipation did not apply to areas of the South not in rebellion (such as southern Louisiana) or to four slave-owning border states (Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri) that never seceded.\n\nThe proclamation's limitations were reflected in the drive, two years later, for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery once and for all. (Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln relegates the proclamation to a footnote in its story of the 13th Amendment.)\n\nThe order could not physically free most slaves, but on the day it was issued, it immediately liberated tens of thousands, most in sections of the Confederacy behind Union lines specifically designated by Lincoln.\n\nThey included the sea islands of South Carolina. When the proclamation was read aloud at a plantation in Port Royal, slaves spontaneously began to sing \"My country 'tis of thee…\"\n\nThe edict was also a vital part of the process of emancipation. In areas such as Tidewater Virginia, slaves were encouraged to flee toward Union lines. As Union armies advanced through the South, more slaves were liberated by the day.\n\nWhen was it issued?\n\nLincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation Jan. 1 but issued a preliminary version Sept. 22, 1862, saying he planned to make it official 100 days later.\n\nYet in late 1862, Lincoln's signature was far from certain. Critics said the proposed order was unconstitutional and unenforceable and would incite the slaves to violent revolt.\n\nAbolitionists, black and white, worried Lincoln wouldn't go through with it. Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin wrote on Dec. 12, \"Everybody I meet in New England says to me with anxious earnestness, 'Will the president stand firm to his Proclamation?'\"\n\nIn the end, what the president signed was different from the preliminary version. He added a provision to allow former slaves to join the Union military forces, and he dropped one for resettling former slaves in Africa and other places outside the USA.\n\nIf this is Lincoln, where's the eloquence?\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation is not a stirring declaration of freedom.\n\nThe Gettysburg Address begins, \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation… \" The proclamation starts, \"Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit …\":\n\nThe proclamation reads like a dry military order, which is what Lincoln — fearing Union border state backlash and Supreme Court review — wanted. \"These words were not meant to excite anyone,\" says Harold Holzer, a Lincoln biographer. \"And by and large, they did not.\"\n\nWas Lincoln the Great Emancipator or a reluctant one?\n\n\"No one was more skeptical of the Emancipation Proclamation than the president who issued it,\" writes James Oakes in his new history, Freedom National. Months before issuing the preliminary version, Lincoln asked a group of abolitionists: \"What good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do?\"\n\nRevisionists have argued that, despite what generations were taught in school, Lincoln issued the order only under political pressure from abolitionists in his Republican Party, and did not believe the races could co-exist in peace.\n\nLerone Bennett Jr., former editor of Ebony magazine, has described Lincoln as a racist who dreamed of an all-white America: \"Every schoolchild knows the story of 'the great emancipator' who freed Negroes with a stroke of the pen out of the goodness of his heart. The real Lincoln ... was a conservative politician who said repeatedly that he believed in white supremacy.\"\n\nYet many historians, including Oakes, say Lincoln the emancipator was far more enthusiastic than reluctant.\n\nHe signed the proclamation even though his party had lost congressional seats in the midterm election after he issued the preliminary version. In November, he told a delegation from Kentucky he'd \"rather die than take back a word of the Proclamation of Freedom.\"\n\nOn Jan. 1, he said, \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right than I do in signing this paper.\"\n\nLincoln's work for emancipation didn't stop there. He maneuvered to gain passage in the House of the 13th Amendment and to get the border states to outlaw slavery.\n\nBut to some, this first major blow by a president against slavery has always seemed to come up short. Last year, at the unveiling of a signed copy of the proclamation, President Obama imagined how pundits today might sum up a proclamation that emancipated but did not end slavery: \"Lincoln sells out slaves.'\"\n\nEmancipation then and now\n\nTo evaluate the Emancipation Proclamation on its 150th anniversary, consider how it was observed in 1962 on its centennial, when Americans gathered for a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nOr at least some did.\n\nNot President Kennedy, who'd backed out of speaking and was in Newport for the America's Cup yacht races.\n\nNot Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett, who was defying a federal court order to admit a black applicant, James Meredith, to the state university at Oxford.\n\nThere were few white Southern officials, who had no desire to commemorate emancipation, and few civil rights leaders, incensed that no African American was originally invited to speak.\n\nThe main speaker, United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, delivered what Yale historian David Blight calls \"a Cold War speech\" that barely mentioned the burgeoning civil rights movement.\n\nFor the Kennedy administration, the \"freedom\" represented by the Emancipation Proclamation was good propaganda against totalitarian communism. But at home, in light of segregation imposed by state Democratic regimes across the old Confederacy, it was an embarrassment.\n\nHistorian Robert Cook says the proclamation's centennial was inherently problematic: When international tensions made national unity imperative, how could leaders admit that the reconciliation of North and South was based on selling out black civil rights?\n\nThe result was a muted, awkward observance. John Lewis says he didn't attend and doesn't even remember it taking place.\n\nYet he was at the Lincoln Memorial 11 months later when hundreds of thousands gathered for the March on Washington. Martin Luther King begin his \"I Have a Dream\" speech with an homage to Lincoln and the proclamation, which King called \"a beacon of light\" for the slaves, \"a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\"\n\nThen King said what had not been said the previous year on the same spot: A century after Emancipation, \"the Negro still is not free.\"\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history; the movement led by King, Lewis and others allowed the nation to realize the ideals of emancipation taught in its schools.\n\nToday, Lewis is 72, one of the few surviving organizers of the March on Washington. As the year turns, he thinks about what he once saw and heard at the Macedonia Baptist Church outside Troy, Ala., and about those who kept the meaning of emancipation alive, New Year's after New Year's.\n\n\"Those stories made me want to do something,\" he says. \"You felt there was other generations before you that was involved in a struggle. And that as a part of that tradition, you had to free yourself.\"\n\nContributing: Melanie Eversley and Larry Copeland of USA TODAY; Jessie Halladay of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal; Marty Roney of the Montgomery (Ala.)

The colonists formally declared their independence on July 2, which John Adams promptly called “the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America,” predicting that it “will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”\n\nAs Independence Day draws near, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at who the 56 signers of the Declaration were. We drew on sources such as USHistory.org, the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association to compile our list.\n\nIt was on July 4, however, that the Continental Congress approved the final text of the Declaration – after jointly making some 86 changes in the draft composed by Thomas Jefferson and four colleagues.\n\nCooking out? America, you're grilling your burgers wrong and it could kill you\n\nDogs and fireworks:Scared pets 'think they're going to die' on the Fourth of July\n\nBut that still wasn’t when this seminal document of our nation was signed. That happened, for the most part, on Aug. 2 – but at least five signers didn’t affix their signatures to the Declaration until the following weeks.\n\nAll those who signed the Declaration were delegates to the Second Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia. The Congress was a convention of representatives from the various colonies. The first one, held in 1774, sought to ease rising tensions between the British and the colonists, while safeguarding the rights of the latter.\n\nThe second Congress, which met from 1775 through 1781, was more radical, and ultimately decided that full independence from Great Britain was essential. Thomas Jefferson was charged with overseeing the drafting of a declaration to that effect. (Jefferson, of course, went on to become our third president, and is in the top ten when historians rank every president.)\n\nThe Congress also appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, which was already involved in battles with the British in what grew into the Revolutionary War – one of the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThere’s little doubt what occasion Pennsylvania would claim in a listing of the most important historical event in every state.\n\nThe majority of the delegates – all of them men – who signed the Declaration had been born in one of the 13 colonies, though a few were native to Great Britain or Ireland. Many were gentleman farmers, and many – sometimes the same ones – were attorneys. Most were well-to-do, though some lost their fortunes during the Revolutionary War or subsequently.\n\nSome of the signers are world famous – among them Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams – and some are obscure. The majority owned slaves – 41 of the 56, according to one study – though there were also ardent abolitionists among their number. Some came to bad ends; one lived to the age of 95.\n\nWhoever they were, one thing is certain: These 56 signers put their lives and livelihoods on the line for the cause of American independence, and without their actions we’d have nothing to celebrate as a nation – on the Fourth of July or any other date.\n\nInformation about the signers of the Declaration of Independence was drawn from USHistory.org, which is the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association, as well as from the websites of The Society of the Descendents of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, and the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nJohn Adams (1735-1826)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nOne of the most revered of the Founding Fathers, the man who was to become the first vice president and the second president of the United States (and father of the nation's sixth president, John Quincy Adams) was a noted attorney, an active member of the Continental Congress, and an outspoken opponent of slavery. In 1783, he helped develop, and signed, the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nSamuel Adams (1722-1803)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nA cousin of John Adams, Samuel Adams has been described as \"an excellent politician, an unsuccessful brewer, and a poor businessman.\" (Despite his apparent lack of brewing success, the Boston Beer Company's popular Samuel Adams brand is named after him.) A leading advocate for independence and a close friend of writer and intellectual Tom Paine, Adams was known as an eloquent orator.\n\nJosiah Bartlett (1729-1795)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nMassachusetts-born Bartlett studied medicine and set up a practice as a doctor in Kingston, New Hampshire. Elected to represent the New Hampshire Colony at the Continental Congress, he was the second person to sign the Declaration of Independence, after John Hancock. He later became governor of the new state of New Hampshire.\n\nCarter Braxton (1736-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nComing from a wealthy plantation family, Braxton became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America, before being named to the Virginia delegation to the Continental Congress. He subsequently served in the U.S. Congress. Braxton, who is known to have had as many as 18 children, made poor financial decisions after serving in Congress and died penniless.\n\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton (1737-1832)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nCarroll was born into a wealthy Annapolis family, and shipped off to be educated in France at the age of 8. He returned to America 20 years later, after subsequent studies in London, and promptly became active in the patriot cause. He held numerous offices in Maryland, both before and after independence, and helped frame the Maryland constitution. He signed the Declaration of Independence as \"Charles Carroll of Carrollton,\" a form of his name that he used to distinguish himself from a number of other Maryland Charles Carrolls. He was the last survivor of the signers, dying at the age of 95.\n\nSamuel Chase (1741-1811)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nClassically educated in Baltimore, Chase had a long and distinguished legal career in Maryland, becoming chief justice of the state supreme court and then an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. He held that post from 1796 until his death in 1811. In the course of his tenure, he became the only Supreme Court justice to ever face impeachment proceedings, brought by Thomas Jefferson and his followers after he resisted Jefferson's attempt to weaken federal judicial powers. His acquittal by the Senate was considered a victory for judicial independence.\n\nAbraham Clark (1725-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA self-taught surveyor and lawyer, born in what is now the New Jersey city of Elizabeth, Clark became locally popular by representing poor farmers in land disputes. He held a number of regional offices before being sent to the Continental Congress as a representative of New Jersey. He served in Congress throughout the Revolutionary War, and after retiring continued to be active in community politics.\n\nGeorge Clymer (1739-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nClymer was a merchant, born in Philadelphia, who became active politically after the British government imposed the unpopular Tea Act and Stamp Act on the colonies. He was an avid supporter of George Washington as both a general and a politician. In retirement, Clymer became the first president of the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and of the Philadelphia Bank.\n\nWilliam Ellery (1727-1820)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nBorn in Newport and educated at Harvard College, graduating at the age of 15, Ellery worked as a merchant, a customs collector, and the clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly before settling on a career in law. After the Revolutionary War, he became an outspoken anti-slavery activist.\n\nWilliam Floyd (1734-1821)\n\n• State: New York\n\nFloyd was born into a prosperous farm family of Welsh descent. He became a soldier in the Suffolk County Militia, and was later elected to the first U.S. Congress under the new constitution. In 1808, he became a state senator. His family's estate is now part of the Fire Island National Seashore.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nThe protean Boston-born Franklin, one of the most famous of the signers, was a businessman, inventor, writer, printer, publisher, scientist, diplomat, and legislator. He was the first postmaster general of the United States and a minister to the French court. A major force in the rebellion against the British, he helped Jefferson draft the Declaration of Independence. Though he owned slaves and initially believed that blacks were inferior to white Europeans, his views evolved and he became a major supporter of the abolitionist cause.\n\nElbridge Gerry (1744-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nIn addition to his service in the Continental Congress and as an envoy to France, as governor of his home state of Massachusetts, and as James Madison's vice president, Gerry has another political distinction: When he was governor, he redrew the map of Massachusetts voting districts to favor his own political party. The Boston Globe ran a cartoon depicting the redrawn districts in the shape of a salamander, with the caption \"The Gerrymander\" – thus giving birth to a term used to this day to mean the manipulation of district boundaries to favor one political faction.\n\nButton Gwinnett (1735-1777)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nGwinnett was born in Gloucestershire, England, to Welsh parents, and moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 1762. He went on to establish a large plantation in neighboring Georgia, and became commander of Georgia's Continental Battalion. Gwinnett and one Laclan McIntosh became bitter political rivals, representing opposing factions in Georgia's patriot movement. In 1777, McIntosh denounced Gwinnett in the Georgia Assembly as \"a scoundrel and a lying rascal\" – prompting Gwinnett to challenge him to a duel. The men shot each other, but McIntosh recovered while Gwinnett died of his wounds three days later.\n\nLyman Hall (1724-1790)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nHall was born in Connecticut and studied medicine at Yale. He set up a practice in Charleston, South Carolina, moved to Georgia to establish a plantation, returned to practice medicine in Charleston, and then settled again in Georgia – where he began helping to provision the Revolutionary Army. After the war, he was elected to Georgia's House of Assembly and later became governor of the state.\n\nJohn Hancock (1737-1793)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nHancock, a Massachusetts native who studied business at Harvard College, was the first man to sign the Declaration of Independence. With plenty of room in the document, he inscribed his name large and with dramatic flourishes. \"I guess King George will be able to read that!\" he reportedly exclaimed. His name stands out so vividly on the Declaration that \"John Hancock\" became a synonym for \"signature\" (as in \"Put your John Hancock right there\"). His revolutionary activities included delivering a stirring oration commemorating the Boston Massacre and support of the Boston Tea Party, and he served as both the president of the Continental Congress and the governor of Massachusetts.\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1726-1791)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe father of William Henry Harrison, the ninth U.S. president, Harrison was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and after independence, served five years as governor of his native Virginia. In his time, he was known as one of Virginia's wealthiest men. His descendants included two U.S. presidents: William Henry Harrison; and one of his great-grandsons, a later Benjamin Harrison, became our 23rd president.\n\nJohn Hart (1711-1779)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA successful farmer, Hart entered public service as a justice of the peace and was subsequently elected to the New Jersey Assembly. In 1778, he invited some 12,000 of George Washington's troops to camp on his farm to rest before resuming their battles with the British. Washington lunched with Hart before holding his July 12 Council of War nearby, at which the general planned his attack on Staten Island.\n\nJoseph Hewes (1730-1779)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, and educated at what was then called Princeton College, Hewes moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, and established a successful shipping business. He was known as the leading expert in maritime affairs in the Continental Congress, and placed his ships at the disposal of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. He later became secretary of the congressional Naval Affairs Committee. The Liberty ship SS Joseph Hewes, which served in World War II, was named in his honor.\n\nThomas Heyward, Jr. (1746-1809)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Heyward studied law in both England and America, becoming one of the earliest advocates of the patriot cause in South Carolina. To the dismay of his father, who feared that the British would hang him in retaliation, Heyward signed the Declaration of Independence just after his 30th birthday, and went on to join the South Carolina Militia as a captain of artillery. He later served as a judge in his native state for 15 years before retiring.\n\nWilliam Hooper (1742-1790)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard, where he studied law, Hooper settled in the North Carolina town of Wilmington in 1767. He served for two years in the Continental Congress, and became a judge of the Federal Court after independence before retiring in ill health. He died young, at 48.\n\nStephen Hopkins (1707-1785)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nApparently self-educated, Hopkins was politically active as a young man but also became a successful shipbuilder, credited with helping to transform Providence into a major commercial center. He and his friend Benjamin Franklin were the two oldest signers. Hopkins was also a cousin of the traitorous Benedict Arnold.\n\nFrancis Hopkinson (1737-1791)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn into a wealthy Philadelphia family, Hopkinson studied law there and in England, and held several judgeships in Pennsylvania, though he represented New Jersey at the Constitutional Convention. He was an accomplished writer and composer, whose works included a satirical anti-British ballad, set to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle,\" called \"Battle of the Kegs.\" He also claimed credit for designing the American flag, though the claim has been disputed.\n\nSamuel Huntington (1731-1796)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA self-taught lawyer born in the Connecticut town of Windham, Huntington was successively an attorney, tax collector, town-meeting moderator, and justice of the peace in nearby Norwich, going on to hold several higher offices in the colony. After independence, he became lieutenant-governor and chief superior court judge in Connecticut, and for a decade was its governor. He is credited with helping to build roads and develop industry in the state.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy hosted an assemblage of Nobel Prize winners from around the Western Hemisphere at the White House in 1962, he remarked \"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\" A lawyer, farmer, scientist, musician, architect, inventor, author, and quintessential politician, he served variously as governor of Virginia, minister to the French court, secretary of state, vice president (under John Adams), and ultimately the third president of the United States. He was also the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nOne of the only pair of brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence, Lee was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America and a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment later dissolved by the British. (It continued to meet in secret at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.) He was an associate of Patrick (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\") Henry and later served in the Virginia Senate.\n\nRichard Henry Lee (1732-1794)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nA signer with his brother, Francis, Lee was likewise a radical member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Lee was elected to attend the first Continental Congress in 1774. He was to become the first state senator from Virginia under the newly formed U.S. government.\n\nFrancis Lewis (1713-1802)\n\n• State: New York\n\nLewis was born in Wales and educated in Scotland and England, then worked as a merchant in London before emigrating to New York to set up his own business in 1734. He subsequently entered into international trade, making several trans-Atlantic voyages and surviving two shipwrecks off the coast of Ireland. Though he grew wealthy, he turned his attentions to radical causes and, along with fellow signer Philip Livingston, contracted to supply arms and ammunition to the rebellious colonists.\n\nPhilip Livingston (1716-1778)\n\n• State: New York\n\nBorn in Albany and educated at Yale, Livingston became a prosperous merchant and alderman in New York City. He was a strong supporter of independence in the Continental Congress, and continued to serve in that body after being elected to the New York State Senate in 1777. Livingston was also one of the founders of King's College, which became Columbia University.\n\nThomas Lynch, Jr. (1749-1779)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nOne of the two youngest signers, along with Edward Rutledge – both were 26 – Lynch attended Cambridge University in England and studied law in London. Back home, he was elected to the Continental Congress, but fell ill shortly after signing the Declaration. Late in 1776, he and his wife sailed for the West Indies, but the ship disappeared and neither was ever heard from again.\n\nThomas McKean (1734-1817)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nThe Pennsylvania-born McKean held an astonishing number of positions in both that state and Delaware over the course of his career, including member of the Delaware Assembly, Delaware delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, collector of Customs and commissioner of revenue for New Castle County (Delaware), delegate to the Continental Congress, president of Delaware, and both chief justice and later governor of the new state of Pennsylvania.\n\nArthur Middleton (1742-1787)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nBorn in Charleston but educated at Cambridge University in England, Middleton traveled around Europe for three years before returning to South Carolina, where he was elected to the provincial House of Commons. He was active in the defense of Charleston against the British, but was captured and spent a year imprisoned. After the war, he served in the state legislature and was one of the original trustees of Charleston College.\n\nLewis Morris (1726-1798)\n\n• State: New York\n\nMorris was born on his family's farm estate, Morrisania, in what is now the Bronx, and studied at Yale. While a delegate to the Continental Congress, he also served as a brigadier general in the New York Militia. He went on to become a member of the New York legislature after independence. When the federal government was considering possible sites for a permanent national capital, he proposed that they consider Morrisania – citing as one of its advantages that its location meant it could \"be amply protected by the hardy sons of New England on the one side, and the inhabitants of the populous City of New York on the other.\"\n\nRobert Morris (1734-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in England but arriving in America at the age of 10, Morris became a wealthy importer and businessman in Philadelphia. Financially acute, he was a major force in securing financing for the Revolutionary War, and after independence he created a national bank that became the Bank of North America. This was credited with bringing economic stability to the new nation and establishing its financial credibility abroad. Washington tried to appoint him as the first secretary of the treasury, but he declined and suggested Alexander Hamilton for the post instead.\n\nJohn Morton (1724-1777)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nA Pennsylvania native, Morton held a number of civic offices there, including justice of the peace, high sheriff, and associate judge of the supreme court. He became chairman of the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation – which served as the first constitution of the newly formed republic until it was supplanted by the present-day Constitution in 1787.\n\nThomas Nelson, Jr. (1738-1789)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nEducated in England, Nelson was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and a co-founder of the Virginia Militia, becoming its first commander and continuing his military career after being elected to the Continental Congress. When Thomas Jefferson declined to run for reelection as governor of Virginia in 1781, Nelson replaced him, still retaining his leadership of the Militia.\n\nWilliam Paca (1740-1799)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Paca earned a master's degree from Philadelphia College at the age of 18 and a license to practice law at 21. He became friendly with another Maryland signer, Samuel Chase, and the two became among the leading anti-British voices in the region. He was elected as governor of the state of Maryland after independence, and George Washington appointed him as chief justice of the state's U.S. District Court.\n\nRobert Treat Paine (1731-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard College, Paine worked as a teacher before shipping out on a series of trading and whaling voyages that took him as far afield as Greenland and Spain. Back on dry land, he became a lawyer, and for a time was a friendly rival to another lawyer, John Adams. Paine was known in the Continental Congress as the \"Objection Maker,\" because he frequently objected to the proposals of other members.\n\nJohn Penn (1741-1788)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nA native of Virginia, where he was licensed to practice law at the age of 22, Penn moved to North Carolina in 1774, setting up a practice and becoming politically active. Besides serving in the Continental Congress, he sat on the Board of War, which oversaw military affairs during the Revolutionary War.\n\nGeorge Read (1733-1798)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn in colonial Maryland, Read studied law in Philadelphia, passing the bar at the age of 20, and later moved to Delaware. He became president of Delaware's Constitutional Convention in 1776. After Delaware became the first state in the fledgling Union, he was elected state senator twice and then appointed chief justice of the State of Delaware, a position he held until his death.\n\nCaesar Rodney (1728-1784)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn on the family farm in the Delaware Colony, Rodney was never formally educated. Nonetheless, he had a distinguished career that included participation in the Colonial Assembly and the Stamp Act Congress, as well as the Continental Congress. He later served as president of the state of Delaware and a member of the state assembly.\n\nGeorge Ross (1730-1779)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Delaware, Ross passed the bar in Philadelphia at the age of 20, subsequently becoming attorney general for the Pennsylvania community of Carlisle. He was elected to the Continental Congress three times, and in 1779, shortly before his death, was appointed as a judge for the Pennsylvania Court of Admiralty, which heard cases involving maritime law.\n\nBenjamin Rush (1745-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvanian Rush was a physician and educator, who studied medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, and spent several years around Europe studying languages, medicine, and science. Back in America, he was appointed surgeon general to an arm of the Continental Army. In his final years, he served dual roles as treasurer of the U.S. Mint and professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. When he died at the age of 68, he was considered the most celebrated physician in the country.\n\nEdward Rutledge (1749-1800)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nEducated at Oxford University and a member of the English bar, Rutledge was one of the two youngest signers, along with Thomas Lynch Jr., (both were 26 at the time). He left the Continental Congress to serve in the Charleston Battalion of Artillery, helping to defend the city against the British. After the war, he was resolute in pursuing the prosecution of British loyalists, and became governor of South Carolina in 1789.\n\nRoger Sherman (1721-1793)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA farmer and (some sources say) shoemaker who became a surveyor and then a lawyer, Sherman entered politics as a member of the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1776, he served on the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, and later became a forceful advocate for the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. According to James Madison, he delivered 138 separate speeches at the Constitutional Convention, and Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams are all said to have held him in high regard.\n\nJames Smith (1719-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Dublin, Ireland, Smith moved to Pennsylvania with his family as a pre-teen. He later apprenticed at the law offices of his older brother, passed the Pennsylvania Bar, and set up a business in which he alternated practicing law with surveying. He was elected to the Continental Congress twice, but the second time he declined the position, citing his advanced age of 66.\n\nRichard Stockton (1730-1781)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nSaid to have been one of the most successful lawyers in the colonies, Stockton became a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court two years before signing the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he was captured and jailed for several years under abusive conditions by the British – during which time the British ransacked his estate and burned his extensive library.\n\nThomas Stone (1743-1787)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nStone worked in Thomas Jefferson's law office before starting his own practice, and was also a prosperous landowner. Little is known about his tenure in the Continental Congress, as he gave few speeches there, and no papers relating to his life have been discovered. Grieving after the death of his wife in 1787, he planned to sail for England, but he died himself in Alexandria while awaiting the arrival of his ship.\n\nGeorge Taylor (1716-1781)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in what is now Northern Ireland, Taylor came to America when he was in his early 20s, becoming an ironmaster – the man in charge of a forge. Though not known for being particularly active politically, he held several elected positions, including a stint in the Continental Congress. In 1775, he was appointed to take the place of a Pennsylvanian delegate who refused to support the break with Britain. He missed the vote, but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMatthew Thornton (1714-1803)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nThe Irish-born Thornton came to America with his parents at the age of three. Educated in Massachusetts, he studied medicine and became a physician in New Hampshire. After independence was declared, he was tasked with drawing up a plan of government for that new state. This became New Hampshire's first constitution, as well as the first post-independence constitution adopted by any state. He missed the debates over independence at the Continental Congress but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nGeorge Walton (1741-1804)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nVirginia-born, Walton apprenticed as a carpenter as a young man, then moved to Savannah, Georgia, to study law, being admitted to the Bar in 1774. He was an ally of Lachlan McIntosh in his rivalry with another Georgia signer, Button Gwinnett, and was censured for supporting McIntosh in the duel that claimed Gwinnett's life. He served briefly as governor of Georgia after independence, then became chief justice of the state, followed by another, longer, term as governor. His last political position was as a U.S. senator.\n\nWilliam Whipple (1730-1785)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nBorn in Maine, Whipple became a seaman, earning the position of ship's master – in effect a captain – at the age of 21. Eight years later, he landed at Portsmouth on the New Hampshire coast and established a business as a merchant. He became politically active and served in the Continental Congress until taking a leave to serve as brigadier general in the New Hampshire Militia during the Revolutionary War.\n\nWilliam Williams (1731-1811)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA Harvard-educated merchant, Williams held the post of town clerk in Lebanon, Connecticut, for 44 years, also serving as selectman and becoming speaker of the house in the colonial legislature. Brought in to replace another Continental Congress member, Oliver Wolcott, who had fallen ill, he arrived too late to vote for independence, but in time to sign the Declaration.\n\nJames Wilson (1742-1798)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Wilson emigrated to America in 1766, studying law and being admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. In 1774, he wrote a pamphlet arguing that the British Parliament had no legal authority over the colonies. It was influential on members of the Continental Congress, to which he was subsequently elected. He later served as a director of the Bank of North America, a member of the Constitutional Convention, and an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJohn Witherspoon (1723-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Witherspoon was brought to America to serve as president of the College of New Jersey – now Princeton University – under the auspices of two other signers, Richard Stockton and Benjamin Rush. When another delegate to the Constitutional Convention suggested that the colonies weren't yet ripe for independence, he famously replied that they were \"not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.\"\n\nOliver Wolcott (1726-1797)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nThe youngest of the 14 children of colonial Connecticut governor Roger Wolcott, Wolcott was educated at Yale, raised a militia to fight in the French and Indian War, and was appointed sheriff of Connecticut's Litchfield County. Returning to military life, he became a colonel in the Connecticut Militia and later brigadier general of Connecticut forces in the Continental Armies. Though too ill to attend the Continental Congress and sign the Declaration of Independence in August of 1776, he added his signature in the fall of that year.\n\nGeorge Wythe (1726-1806)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe scion of a wealthy agricultural family, Wythe studied law and was admitted to the bar in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, at the age of 20. A member of the House of Burgesses and one-time attorney general of Virginia, he became America's first law professor, at the College of William and Mary – where his students included Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Marshall. After independence, he freed his slaves and willed part of his family property to one of them – which spurred his disinherited grandnephew to fatally poison both the man and Wythe.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Adams moved into the White House in late 1800.\n\n(Adams, by the way, initially believed Independence Day celebrations would be on July 2, the day the Continental Congress approved a resolution of independence. Over the years, however, Americans began to celebrate July 4, the day the Congress approved the actual document known as the Declaration of Independence.)\n\nIn general, presidents like to meet with large groups of people on July 4. In the early days, they even threw open the doors of the White House to greet members of the public.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the third president and Adams' successor, held the first Fourth of July reception at the Executive Mansion in 1801.\n\nIn more recent times, amid heavy security around the president, White House holiday events are by invitation only.\n\nPresidents also like going to famous places on July 4, Heintze said. Gettysburg, Valley Forge and Philadelphia's Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) have been on holiday presidential schedules.\n\nThe Fourth of July also holds a somber place in presidential history.\n\nAdams and Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Another early president, James Monroe, died on July 4, 1831.\n\nOn a happier note, one president was born on the Fourth of July (Calvin Coolidge in 1872). So was at least one presidential family member: Malia Obama, who turns 16 on Friday.\n\nPresidents have often used the holiday as a call for renewal of the nation's heritage.\n\nAs the nation faced Civil War on July 4, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called an extraordinary session of Congress to discuss the crisis and urge national unity.\n\nEighty years later, with Nazi Germany in control of Western Europe and imperial Japan threatening the Pacific, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a somber address from his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., on July 4, 1941.\n\nThe United States broke from Great Britain to fight for its freedom, Roosevelt said, but \"the fundamentals of 1776 are being struck down abroad and definitely they are threatened here.\"\n\nLittle more than five months later, the United States plunged into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nObama's predecessor, George W. Bush, often discussed the war on terrorism during July 4 events that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On his last Fourth of July as president, in 2008, Bush became the fourth president to visit Jefferson's home at Monticello, Va., where he presided over naturalization ceremonies.\n\nObama, swearing in immigrant service members in 2012, called it \"a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday — the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/30/words-declaration-independence-still-inspire/86530366/", "title": "Words of Declaration of Independence still inspire", "text": "Robert Evins Pickard\n\nOn July 4, 1826, Americans were celebrating 50 years of independence. At dusk, 91-year-old John Adams spoke his last words, “Jefferson survives.\" He did not know that on that morning, his onetime ally, enemy and friend, Thomas Jefferson, had passed. The fact that two presidents died on the same day pops up on quiz shows occasionally. What is even more astounding is that it was on the day celebrating the document that those two did more than anyone to create.\n\nWhen the gathering of colonial elite known as the “Continental Congress” decided to go for broke and declare independence, one delegate told Jefferson, “When they hang us, I’ll go quickly, because I am very fat. You will dangle for a while.” He was only half-joking. Benjamin Franklin, possibly the most respected man in the world, chaired the committee responsible for writing the declaration; he left it to the committee's younger members, Adams and Jefferson, saying that he did not want his work edited by others. Adams told Jefferson that he must be the author, for three reasons: 1. Having a Virginian author would bring the most populous colony and the rest of the South into the struggle; 2. Jefferson was much better liked than the obnoxious Adams; and 3. Jefferson was a far better writer.\n\nAt a time when equality was not even a pipe dream for slaves, free blacks, Indians, women, religious minorities and non-property owners, Jefferson wrote what historians see as a promise: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It is a promise that still inspires us. The black historian John Hope Franklin said, “I thought that they were beautiful words. They reinforced what my parents told me, that no one was better than I was.” When Congress adapted the declaration, Adams presciently wrote his wife Abigail: \"It ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other... .\"\n\nOn July 4, 1863, the United States was at war with itself. President Abraham Lincoln, however, had reason to celebrate: The Union had not only prevailed at Gettysburg the previous day, but Vicksburg had surrendered that day to General Ulysses S. Grant, giving control of the Mississippi to the Union. On Nov. 19, Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg Battlefield by reminding the country that the founding fathers had created a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” and called for them to continue the cause for which the dead on this ground had given “their last full measure of devotion” so that “government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”\n\nOne hundred years later, on Memorial Day 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson told an audience at Gettysburg: “Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation, but not a fact.” A year later, President Johnson pushed through Congress the first of three civil rights acts, fulfilling, more than anyone, Jefferson’s promise.\n\nIn 1946, the U.S. relinquished sovereignty of the Philippines. The Filipinos celebrate their independence on June 12, the day in 1898 when they declared independence from Spain, but they celebrate July 4 as Filipino-American Friendship Day. Others have been inspired as well: When Ho Chi Minh, a former resident and admirer of the United States, wrote Vietnam’s declaration of independence from France in 1946, he quoted Jefferson’s words. Ironically, he would face a long struggle against both France and the U.S. “Born on the Fourth of July” is a line from a song by George M. Cohan, as well as the name of a movie by Oliver Stone. Louis Armstrong claimed to be born on the Fourth of July, 1900; he wasn’t, but he might as well have been. Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July picnic in Texas is an annual event.\n\nJefferson’s promise has inspired many over the years. In view of recent events, it is now time, more than ever, for our national leaders to rededicate themselves to his promise.\n\nRobert Evins Pickard, MA, MPA, is an adjunct professor of U.S. and world history at Nashville State Community College.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/green-sheet/2017/07/04/day-history-july-4/438873001/", "title": "This day in history — July 4", "text": "Associated Press\n\nToday’s highlight in history\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.\n\nOn this date\n\nIn 1802, the United States Military Academy officially opened at West Point, N.Y.\n\nIn 1826, 50 years to the day after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, former presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died. (Five years later on the same date, former president James Monroe died.)\n\nIn 1917, during a ceremony in Paris honoring the French hero of the American Revolution, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Charles E.

The day has had a fascinating history ever since, rife with quirky coincidences and inventive celebrations.\n\nWant to impress your friends and family at this year's Fourth of July gathering? Check out these facts you might not have known about the holiday.\n\n1. Congress didn't actually vote for independence on July 4.\n\nTwelve of thirteen states approved a resolution for independence on July 2, not July 4, when the declaration was actually adopted. New York didn't vote until July 9. Many of the signers didn't attach their names to the document until August 2.\n\nJohn Adams famously insisted the annual celebration of independence be held July 2, not July 4, and refused to attend any events on the latter day.\n\n2. The Fourth of July didn't become an official holiday until over a century after America declared its independence.\n\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, that American independence should be celebrated with “pomp and Parade…Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.”\n\nThough early celebrations began the following year, the Fourth of July wasn't designated a federal holiday until 1870. In 1941, it became a paid holiday for federal employees.\n\n3. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington gave his soldiers a special treat for the holiday.\n\nOn July 4, 1778, George Washington ordered a double ration of rum for his soldiers. He also ordered a cannon salute to celebrate the occasion.\n\nDrinking was a large part of historical Fourth of July celebrations — it was traditional to drink 13 toasts, one for each state in the union.\n\n4. In a bizarre coincidence, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both died on July 4, 1826 — the nation's 50th birthday.\n\nThe two founding fathers and political adversaries died within five hours of each other.\n\nAs Adams lay on his deathbed, unaware that Jefferson had died earlier that day in Monticello, he reportedly spoke his last words: \"Jefferson still survives\".\n\nJames Monroe was the third president to die on July 4: he passed away in 1831.\n\n5. Calvin Coolidge is the only president to be born on July 4.\n\nCoolidge, the 30th U.S. president, was born on Independence Day in 1872.\n\nOther July 4 birthdays include first daughter Malia Obama, gangster Meyer Lansky, author Nathaniel Hawthorne, and reality TV star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino.\n\n6. The United States isn't the only country to celebrate independence on July 4.\n\nThe Philippines gained its independence from U.S. colonial control on July 4, 1946, and the day became a national holiday.\n\nIn 1962, however, the day was changed to June 12 in light of rising Filipino nationalism and resentment toward prior American colonialism. July 4 remains on the books as \"Philippine Republic Day,\" but isn't widely observed.\n\n7. Celebrating with fireworks is as old as the holiday itself.\n\nAt the first Fourth of July celebrations, which took place in Philadelphia in 1777, revelers fired a cannon 13 times, once for each colony. That night, 13 fireworks were fired off from the city's commons.\n\nThe tradition has only blossomed since then. In 1934, an explorer in Antarctica set off fireworks to celebrate the holiday in relatively warm weather for the continent: 33 degrees below zero.\n\n8. And today, fireworks are a massive industry.\n\nAccording to the American Pyrotechnics Association, Americans spent over $1 billion on fireworks in 2017. That number has roughly tripled over the last 20 years.\n\n9. July 4 is the biggest hot dog day of the year.\n\nAmericans consume roughly 150 million hot dogs on the Fourth of July — enough to stretch from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles five times.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, which is over a century old, takes place July 4 every year. The record, currently held by Joey Chestnut, is 72 hot dogs in 10 minutes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/us/what-we-know-highland-park-shooting/index.html", "title": "What we know about the Illinois July Fourth parade shooting | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA gunman in Highland Park, Illinois, killed seven people and injured dozens more on a July Fourth parade route on Monday, setting off a manhunt that paralyzed the Chicago region before a suspect was apprehended by police later in the day.\n\nThe wounded ranged from ages 8 to 85. All the deceased victims were adults, Lake County Coroner Jennifer Banek said Tuesday. Five of them died at the scene, she said.\n\nThe suspect, 21-year-old Robert E. Crimo III, was taken into custody after a tip from “an alert member of the community” helped police track him down in his mother’s vehicle and detained him during a traffic stop. He was unharmed.\n\nEric Rinehart, Lake County state’s attorney, said Crimo faces seven charges of first-degree murder and that he plans to seek the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole should the suspect be convicted. Dozens of other charges will be added soon, including attempted murder, he said.\n\nFirearm evidence was found on the rooftop of a business near the shooting, Highland Park Police Commander Chris O’Neill said on Monday. The gunman used a ladder attached to the wall of the building from an alley to access the roof, said Christopher Covelli, spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force.\n\nThe suspect allegedly fired more than 70 rounds during what Covelli on Tuesday initially described as a “completely random” attack – one that law enforcement now believes but one that the suspect spent weeks planning and sought to escape without capture by dressing up as a woman to conceal his identity.\n\nThere have been more than 300 mass shootings in less than 200 days, according to data compiled by the non-profit Gun Violence Archive. Shootings included a racist killing spree in Buffalo, New York, that left 10 dead and the massacre of 19 young students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nHere is what we know about the deadly attack in Illinois so far:\n\nThe shooting\n\nThe deadly gunfire erupted a little after 10 a.m. local time along a parade route on the town’s Central Avenue.\n\nPolice say the suspected shooter mounted the rooftop of a building and used a “high-powered rifle” – described by Covelli as “similar to an AR-15” – to begin his assault, about 20 minutes after the procession began. Some bystanders said they initially thought the sound of the gunshots was from fireworks.\n\nBut soon, the crowds began to flee the scene, leaving behind their belongings – a mishmash of chairs, strollers and other Fourth of July-branded American flag signage.\n\nCovelli said Tuesday “there are approximately 45 injured or deceased from this incident.”\n\nThe victims\n\nAuthorities have identified six of the seven people who died, including a married couple whose 2-year-old child was found alive.\n\nThey were Katherine Goldstein, 64, of Highland Park; Irina McCarthy, 35, of Highland Park; Kevin McCarthy, 37, of Highland Park; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63, of Highland Park; Stephen Straus, 88, of Highland Park; and Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78, of Morelos, Mexico.\n\nThe seventh victim died in Cook County and has not been identified by officials there.\n\nThe McCarthys were parents to a young son named Aiden, according to Irina Colon, who was related to Irina McCarthy.\n\nA verified GoFundMe campaign Colon organized says that in the aftermath of the violence, the young child was taken to safety by community members before his grandparents were located.\n\n“At two years old, Aiden is left in the unthinkable position; to grow up without his parents,” the campaign says. “Aiden will be cared for by his loving family and he will have a long road ahead to heal, find stability, and ultimately navigate life as an orphan. He is surrounded by a community of friends and extended family that will embrace him with love, and any means available to ensure he has everything he needs as he grows.”\n\nThe campaign has raised more than $1.4 million.\n\n\n\nShooter passed background checks, purchased gun legally\n\nHighland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering has told reporters that the firearm used by the alleged gunman was legally purchased.\n\n“That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws are protecting the very people that they’re supposed to be protecting,” Rotering told CNN.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, Covelli confirmed that the weapons – including one found inside the suspect’s vehicle during his arrest – had been legally obtained and purchased “locally within the region.”\n\nCrimo passed four background checks between June 2020 and September 2021 when purchasing firearms, Illinois state police said in a statement. Those background checks went through the Firearms Transaction Inquiry Program (FTIP), which includes the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), state police added.\n\nCovelli also said investigators believe that Crimo had planned the attack for “weeks” and accessed a rooftop on the parade route via a fire escape ladder.\n\nAccording to Covelli, Crimo also dressed in women’s clothes during the attack in an effort to conceal his identity, including notable face tattoos. Following the shooting, he said, Crimo dropped his weapon and attempted to blend in with the crowd as it fled. He then made his way to his mother’s house and took her vehicle. (There is no indication, police said, that Crimo communicated with his mother.)\n\nCrimo’s car was subsequently identified, Covelli said, by “an alert member of the community” who saw it and called police, leading to a traffic stop that ended with the suspect’s arrest.\n\nCovelli also told reporters that investigators do not believe the attack was racially or religiously motivated.\n\n“The shooting appears to be completely random,” he said.\n\nShooter posted music videos featuring animated gun violence\n\nOn Monday, Rotering said she had known Crimo since “he was just a little boy, a quiet little boy,” as she had been his pack leader during his time a Cub Scout.\n\nMore recently, Crimo, who fashioned himself as “Awake the Rapper,” posted a series of online music videos he apparently made that featured ominous sounding lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence.\n\nIn one clip, Crimo is seen with multicolored hair and face tattoos and is narrating, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.” The video shows a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter – resembling Crimo’s appearance – in tactical gear carrying out an attack with a rifle.\n\nIn a video titled “Toy Soldier,” another stick-figure cartoon character resembling Crimo is depicted lying face down on the floor in a pool of his own blood surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn. Another video, from September 24, 2021, showed Crimo III sitting on a set resembling a classroom, wearing a helmet and posing in various scenes while an instrumental arrangement of “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” played in the background.\n\nThe videos appear to have been posted online last year.\n\nThe Facebook and Twitter accounts believed to belong to Crimo were taken down after he was named as a person of interest in the mass shooting.\n\nCrimo lives in an apartment behind his father’s house in Highwood, Illinois, according to his uncle, Paul Crimo, who said he also lives in the house.\n\n“I’m heartbroken. I’m so heartbroken,” Paul Crimo said. “There were no signs that I saw that would make him do this.”\n\nHe said has not ever seen his nephew engage in any violence or concerning behavior.\n\nPaul Crimo said he does not know of any political views held by his nephew, though he described the suspect as active on YouTube.\n\n“He’s a quiet kid,” Paul Crimo said. “He’s usually on his own. He’s a lonely, quiet person. He keeps everything to himself.”\n\nBobby Crimo, his uncle said, did not to his knowledge currently have a job, though he worked at a Panera Bread before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPaul Crimo also described a discussion with the FBI on Monday afternoon. Law enforcement officials arrived at the Highwood home and, with the permission of Robert Crimo Jr., the suspect’s father, searched it after using a battering device on the door.\n\nCrimo Jr., his brother confirmed, had previously run for mayor.\n\n“We are good people here, and to have this is devastating,” Paul Crimo said. “I’m so heartbroken for all the families who lost their lives.”\n\nWhat political leaders are saying\n\nVice President Kamala Harris made an unscheduled visit Tuesday to Highland Park, after her remarks to the National Education Association annual meeting in Chicago.\n\nHarris expressed her support for the community and urged the country to “stand together and speak out” about why gun violence has to stop.\n\nShe told the people affected by the tragedy the White House stands with them and is providing all the federal resources the community asks for.\n\nShe also called for more change in gun laws.\n\n“We’ve got to be smarter as a country, in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons. And we’ve got to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are, because you have been forced to have to take this seriously,” she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Monday said he and first lady Jill Biden were “shocked by the senseless gun violence that has yet again brought grief to an American community on this Independence Day.”\n\nHe said he was going to continue to fight the “epidemic of gun violence.”\n\nLater in the day, speaking from the White House, Biden touted a recently passed bipartisan gun safety law.\n\n“Before I left for Europe, I signed into law the first real gun safety law in 30 years,” he said. “Things will get better still, but not without more hard work together. You all heard what happened – you all what heard what happened today, and each day we’re reminders there’s nothing guaranteed about our democracy, nothing guaranteed about our way of life – you have to fight for it, defend it, and earn it by voting, to refine, evolve, and extend the calling of America to move forward boldly and unafraid.”\n\nThe President, though, demurred after being asked whether the bill he signed less than two weeks ago might have made a difference on Monday.\n\n“We don’t know the circumstances yet,” Biden said.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, speaking on Monday night, said he had spoken with Biden.\n\n“If you are angry today, I’m here to tell you to be angry. I’m furious,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said on Monday. “I’m furious that yet more innocent lives were taken by gun violence. I’m furious that their loved ones are forever broken by what took place today.”\n\nThe state’s two US senators also addressed the shooting. Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking Senate Democrat, called for stricter gun control laws.\n\n“There is no reason for a person to own a military assault weapon. It has no value for hunting, or sports or even self-defense,” he said. “It is a killing machine.”\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat, also mourned those slain and pledged to direct any federal resources she could to the community.\n\n“This morning, I got up like most Americans, like the families of (those) who were killed. To celebrate life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Those … families no longer have that opportunity,” Duckworth said.\n\nDoctor says victims were ‘blown up’ by gunfire\n\nDr. David Baum, a local obstetrician who treated victims on-site told CNN “the people who were killed, were killed instantly.”\n\nBaum said he waited about a minute to make sure gunshots had stopped before jumping in to attend to the victims at the scene.\n\n“The people who were gone, were blown up by that gunfire – blown up,” Baum said. “The horrific scene of some of the bodies is unspeakable.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t think the average person has to see a body eviscerated or a head injury that’s unspeakable, to understand that … they shouldn’t have to see that to understand what the problem is with this country.”\n\nTwo doctors from the NorthShore University Health System also spoke to reporters about the treatment of patients at Highland Park Hospital.\n\n“There have been a lot of different events that have happened in the United States and this obviously now has hit very close to home. It is a little surreal to have to take care of an event such as this, but all of us have gone through extensive training,” said Temple, the system’s medical director.\n\nDr. Mark Talamonti, chairman of surgery for the health system, praised the “heroic effort” of hospital trauma surgeons, but called Monday a “tough day.”\n\n“There’s a lot of emotions, but these trauma surgeons, their reflexes are extraordinary. They know exactly what to do,” Talamonti said. “So you stand in awe at their competency and their professionalism. But it breaks your heart to see people – innocents – essentially wounded.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated how many people died at the scene.

Crimo led officers on a brief chase before being stopped. He was taken into custody without incident and will be transferred to the police department in Highland Park, where the deadly shooting occurred earlier Monday.\n\nEarlier, as law enforcement searched for Crimo, police had labeled him “a person of interest” and the FBI said, “He being sought for his alleged involvement in the shooting of multiple individuals at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois.”\n\nThe capture ended an intense manhunt across the Chicagoland area after the shooting upended Independence Day festivities in cities throughout the region.\n\nThe shooting in Highland Park, about 25 miles north of Chicago, began shortly after 10 a.m. CT as parade-goers enjoyed a sunny Fourth of July parade along Central Avenue.\n\nRobert \"Bobby\" E.

The patients ranged in age from 8 years old to 85 years old – four or five were children, according to Temple.\n\nHe said 19 of the 25 gunshot victims were treated and have been discharged. There were gunshot wounds to extremities as well as more central parts of bodies, he added.\n\nThe shooting caused hundreds of parade attendees to flee and triggered a large police response of local, state and federal officers, including the FBI. Heavily armed officers patrolled the streets of Highland Park on Monday afternoon, and others were positioned on rooftops with sniper rifles.\n\nZoe Pawelczak, who attended the Independence Day parade with her father, said parade-goers initially thought the array of pops were fireworks given the occasion.\n\n“And I was like, something’s wrong.

He told CNN he saw a number of people bloodied and on the ground and described the scene as chaotic.\n\nVideo taken by a witness, Hugo Aguilera, shows an ambulance turning around on the parade route and a police car with sirens on, as people gathered on the grassy sidewalk.

People began yelling “shooter” and “run” and he and his family fled toward their car for safety.\n\n“People were hiding, kids were on the streets looking for their parents, just in a state of shock,” he said.\n\nUS Rep. Brad Schneider, a Democrat who represents the area, told CNN he was just arriving in Highland Park when the shots were fired and he was told to detour.\n\n“Everyone scattered and ran. As I was going around, I came across a group of young kids who were trying to call their parents to say they were OK,” he said. “So I stopped and offered them to use my phone.

Crimo III, 21, is convicted, the charges could lead to a mandatory life sentence, Rinehart said. More charges are expected to come, Rinehart said, including attempted murder, aggravated discharge and aggravated battery charges.\n\n“These are just the first of many charges that will be filed against Mr. Crimo, I want to emphasize that,” Rinehart said, adding he anticipates “dozens of more charges centering around each of the victims.”\n\nCrimo has been in police custody since being apprehended Monday evening.\n\n“Tomorrow morning at the Lake County courthouse, we will ask a judge to hold Mr. Crimo without the possibility of bail,” Rinehart said.\n\nAttorney Thomas Durkin confirmed to CNN his representation of Crimo.\n\nAttorney Steve Greenberg has been retained to represent Crimo’s parents, Greenberg confirmed to CNN Tuesday evening in an email.

Crimo III dressed in women's clothing. Lake County Major Crime Task Force\n\n“He blended right in with everybody else as they were running around, almost as (if) he was an innocent spectator as well,” Covelli said late Tuesday morning at a news conference outside Highland Park police headquarters.\n\nCovelli also revealed Tuesday that Crimo had two prior incidents with law enforcement. In April 2019, an individual contacted authorities about Crimo attempting suicide. Authorities spoke with Crimo and his parents, and the matter was handled by mental health professionals, Covelli said.\n\nThen, in September 2019, a family member reported that Crimo threatened “to kill everyone” and had a collection of knives, Covelli said. Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from their residence. Highland Park police reported the incident to Illinois State Police.\n\n“At that time there was no probable cause to arrest. There were no complaints that were signed by any of the victims,” Covelli said.\n\nShortly after the September incident, Crimo legally purchased five firearms – a combination of rifles, a pistol and possibly a shotgun – between 2020 and 2021, according to Covelli. In order to buy firearms in Illinois, individuals need a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card. Crimo was under 21, so he was sponsored by his father, state police said in a news release. Crimo’s application was not denied because there was “insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger” at the time.\n\nInvestigators still are trying to determine a motive for Monday’s shooting, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo, authorities believe, used a high-powered rifle “similar to an AR-15” to fire more than 70 rounds into a parade crowd from a business’s roof, which he accessed by a fire escape’s ladder, Covelli said.\n\nSounds of gunshots pierced the sunny parade just after 10 a.m. CT along the town’s Central Avenue, about 25 miles north of Chicago, sending hundreds of attendees scattering in terror – abandoning strollers, chairs and American-flag paraphernalia on the streets.

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nA man who’d fled the carnage uninjured with his sons returned Tuesday and found the wheelchair of his elder son, who has special needs. They’d abandoned the wheelchair Monday – and the younger sibling carried his brother – after the elder fell out as they hurried away from the shooting.\n\n“We’re all a little shaken. It’s hard to believe this happened, and only (yesterday). And I think we’re all a little shaky and unsettled, (is) probably the best way to describe it,” the father, Paul Toback, told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday.\n\nBoth inside and outside the taped-off zone, belongings of parade visitors remained strewn on the ground. Among them: a baby carriage, a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee overrun by ants, a half-eaten cup of noodles, a toy truck, sunscreen, bottles of water, dog treats, and a stuffed Sonic the Hedgehog toy.\n\n‘Much more work to do’\n\nLast year was the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014. There were a total of 692 mass shootings in the US in 2021, the non-profit says.\n\nThe Highland Park attack comes after several recent mass shootings that shocked the nation, including an 18-year-old’s racist attack at a New York supermarket that killed 10 and another 18-year-old’s shooting at a Texas school that left 19 students and two teachers dead.\n\nHighland Park resident Murry Rosenbush is reflected in a store window Tuesday as he removes items left behind by attendees to the town's Fourth of July parade. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nIn the wake of those massacres, President Joe Biden signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\nBiden held a brief moment of silence at the White House on Monday evening during a July Fourth picnic, noting that he’d spoken to Gov. Pritzker and Highland Park’s mayor.\n\n“There is much more work to do, and I’m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence,” Biden said in a statement released Monday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Highland Park Tuesday after delivering a speech at the National Education Association earlier in the day.\n\n“We’re here for you and we stand with you,” Harris said, adding that the administration would continue to offer federal assistance. “We’ve got to be smarter as a country, in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons.”\n\nIn 2013, Highland Park had passed a local ban on semi-automatic firearms with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition, following a series of mass shooting incidents around the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mayor Rotering said Monday’s shooting showed a need for strict gun laws nationally.\n\n“I think it’s important to know that our assault weapons ban … is reflective of the values of our community,” she said. “Obviously we have a problem in this country if we have weekly mass shootings involving these weapons of war, and it’s important for us to talk about how to provide that protection on a broader scale, whether it’s statewide (or) whether it’s nationally.”\n\nThe scene following a shooting in Highland Park on July 4. Network Video Productions\n\nWhat we know about the suspect\n\nFormer classmates described Crimo Tuesday as an odd, soft-spoken kid who didn’t participate in class or school activities and showed little interest in engaging with his peers.\n\nThe few friends Crimo had tended to be troublemakers who seemed to relish the notion of being outsiders, a couple of his former classmates said.\n\n“They wanted to be the ‘anti-’ group, like the rebels,” said Mackenzie, a former middle school classmate who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her privacy. “The aura they presented was opposite, negative and harsh.”\n\nOther classmates, who wished not to be identified, described Crimo as a skater kid who made DIY skateboard videos on YouTube all the time.\n\nJust before Crimo dropped out of Highland Park High in 2017, he splattered “Awake” stickers in the school’s stairways and bathrooms, the former classmate said. Crimo made music under the name “Awake the Rapper.”\n\nOn Monday, Covelli said law enforcement officials “processed a significant amount of digital evidence,” which helped investigators identify Crimo as the suspect.\n\nCrimo posted online music videos on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website, with some featuring animated scenes of gun violence.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter – resembling Crimo’s appearance – is seen in tactical gear carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo is seen narrating, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.”\n\nThe suspect’s uncle, Paul A. Crimo, told CNN he had spoken at length to law enforcement on Monday and described his nephew as a “lonely, quiet person.”\n\nHe said he does not know of any political views held by his nephew, though he described him as active on YouTube.\n\nHis brother, who is the suspect’s father, ran for mayor against incumbent Rotering in 2019 and lost.\n\n“I’m so heartbroken for all the families who lost their lives,” Paul Crimo said.\n\nRotering knew the suspect, having been leader of his Cub Scout pack when he was a boy. “He was a Cub Scout in my … pack. So, many years ago, he was just a … quiet little boy that I knew,” Rotering told CNN Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t know what got him to this point, but let’s ask that question of so many people,” she said.\n\nStories of terror\n\nWitnesses told stories of sheer terror following the shooting in the affluent Chicago suburb.\n\nSome bystanders initially thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks, until many fled in terror.\n\nEyewitnesses described grabbing their children and families and running for their lives, some hiding behind dumpsters or in nearby stores for safety amid the chaos. One paradegoer described seeing someone shot and killed, another saw a man shot in the ear with blood all over his face.\n\nBarbara Medina told CNN Tuesday her arm was broken during the stampede when bullets rained down on the parade. She was marching in the parade holding the banner for Community Partners for Affordable Housing (CPAH) when she heard gunshots ring out.\n\nA sea of people rushed toward her, so she dropped the banner, grabbed her 7-year-old daughter Caroline and her scooter and ran. She was separated from her 12-year-old son and her father in the chaos.\n\nMedina fled down an alley and noticed her daughter slowing down behind her. She reached back to grab her and help her along, but tripped on her scooter and fell hard on her left arm. She knew immediately it was broken.\n\n“I could see it went the wrong way, and I had to kind of maneuver it back. It was very painful,” she said.\n\nShe eventually made it to a stranger’s home, where she learned her son and his father were safe and sheltering elsewhere.\n\nMedina borrowed a sling and an ice pack and propped her arm up on some pillows to relieve the pain. Hours later, she went to a local non-trauma hospital to get her arm set and said doctors diagnosed her with a broken proximal radius just below the elbow. She now has a cast from the tips of her fingers to the top of her shoulder and expects to be in a cast for six to eight weeks.\n\nJonathan Birnberg, 41, told CNN Tuesday he attended the parade this year with his wife, 9-year-old son and 7-year-old twins.\n\n“The parade is a big tradition and didn’t happen the last two years, so everyone was really excited. There’s a carnival after and fireworks tonight, and there was excitement about bringing those traditions back,” Birnberg said.\n\nWhen the gunfire began, he said nobody moved at first, unaware of the meaning of the noise. During a second round of shots, though, he said he saw people running down the street, and so he and his family began to run in the same direction. He ducked into a coffee shop and, after regrouping with his whole family, fled to a neighbor’s house for safety along with a large group of other children and parents.\n\nMaggie Schmieder, 40, attended Monday’s parade with family and friends. She described the moments after the shooting more as “chaotic calm” than terror or panic.\n\n“People weren’t like sprinting or diving down,” she said. “It was like there was this confusion, but people automatically started going.”\n\nShe and her family fled the area and eventually made their way to their car before driving away from the scene safely.\n\nSchmieder works as a teacher and said she has prepared for a mass shooting at her school.\n\n“I always feared that this could happen at work. I naively, truly never thought that it would happen here, and certainly not at a crowded public event with a celebration,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Adrienne Broaddus Helen Regan", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Adrienne Broaddus", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/us/chicago-residents-holiday-weekend-shootings-reaj/index.html", "title": "Chicago's 4th of July weekend death toll surpassed the Highland ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAngela Gregg’s 4-year-old son, Mychal Moultry Jr., known to loved ones as MJ, was killed by a stray bullet while getting his hair braided last year during Labor Day weekend in Chicago’s South Side neighborhood Woodlawn.\n\nShe remembers him as a genius who was set to skip ahead to kindergarten after just two weeks of pre-school. He was full of life and didn’t call her “Mom” or “Mommy” but “Happy.”\n\nGregg recalls having to move mountains to get any public and media attention on his case. Like many people, she was horrified by what happened in Highland Park, Illinois, on Monday, but she couldn’t help but notice the difference in reaction to the tragedy that shattered her world. MJ was Gregg’s only child, and in the 10 months since his death, no one is in custody for the boy’s homicide and the investigation remains open.\n\nBut she was not surprised by the attention and support Highland Park received because it’s a predominantly White Chicago suburb, she says. Gun violence is so normalized in Chicago’s South and West sides, that it doesn’t receive the same concern, she says.\n\n“I thought there would be more outcry for a 4-year-old whose life was taken away, and I just didn’t see that,” Gregg says. “We see it all the time, the difference in how Black and Brown children are treated.”\n\nAngela Gregg with her 4-year-old son Mychal Moultry, Jr. Courtesy Angela Gregg\n\nAs the nation was shocked by the premeditated mass shooting in Highland Park, residents an hour away on Chicago’s South and West sides were grieving a death and injury toll that surpassed that of Highland Park. This July 4 weekend in Chicago, at least eight people were fatally shot and 68 injured by gun violence.\n\nGregg and community advocates say they aren’t comparing which tragedy is worse and stand in solidarity with the Highland Park community. They just want to see the same compassion and urgency to find answers as seen in Highland Park in the South and West sides – where they say there’s almost an expectation and acceptance of gun violence with little attention or resources paid.\n\nAccording to Chicago Police Department data, the city of Chicago saw a 53% decrease in homicides this year compared to last July 4 weekend. But residents say that doesn’t ease the sense of exasperation they felt following this past weekend’s gun violence.\n\nIn 2021, Chicago experienced one of its deadliest years in the last quarter-century with almost 800 homicides. MJ was among the youngest victims. In the summer alone, 1,606 people were shot in a single three-month period.\n\n‘These kids all hit the ground’\n\nCorey Brooks, founder and senior pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago, says in city’s South and West sides, there’s a constant fear among Black and Brown youth that they’ll be the next victim of gun violence. He recalls being at a playground with a group of kids last summer when gun shots broke out, and all the kids playing in the area immediately ducked down to the ground.\n\n“In any other neighborhood, kids would have probably took off running, but these kids all hit the ground,” he says. “What a sad commentary that these kids know, ‘OK, somebody’s shooting, hit the ground.’”\n\nPastor Corey B. Brooks told CNN that Black and Brown kids in low-income neighorhoods live in constant fear. Courtesy Pastor Corey Brooks\n\nBrooks is also the founder and CEO of Project Helping Others Obtain Destiny (HOOD), a non-profit organization focused on ending cycles of poverty and violence that provides mentorship to Chicago’s Woodlawn and Englewood residents.\n\nBrooks says predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods like Woodlawn and Englewood are heavily affected by gun violence, alongside other communities in the South and West sides like Austin, Roseland, Back of the Yards, Humboldt Park and more. What ties these communities together is poverty and lack of resources, which means they get neglected, he added.\n\nIn Highland Park, the median household income is $147,067, according to 2020 Census data, over five times more than the median income in Woodlawn that sits at $25,450, according to a 2021 report from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.\n\nFollowing the Highland Park mass shooting, politicians including Vice President Kamala Harris, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Sen. Tammy Duckworth visited the community.\n\n\"If you are in a position of power, you must make sure that the same energy and the same effort that you put in one area is put in the other,\" TJ Grooms told CNN. Courtesy TJ Grooms\n\nTJ Grooms, an assistant pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago who’s also a manager with Project HOOD, says he wishes these politicians would also have visited Chicago’s South and West sides and shown the same insistence to offer condolences to the families impacted by gun violence over the July 4 weekend.\n\n“If you are in a position of power, you must make sure that the same energy and the same effort that you put in one area is put in the other,” Grooms said. “I will not visit an area like Highland Park and then not show up to the other end of the spectrum.”\n\nThey’re no longer allowed to be children\n\nGrooms says mental health among the Black and Brown youth in Chicago’s South and West sides is a major issue in connection to gun violence. Young people are left traumatized and don’t know how to deal with these violent experiences, forcing them into “survival mode” where their childhood is stripped from them, he added.\n\nIn the months since MJ’s death, Gregg also struggles with the trauma and void of losing her only child. But she’s also become a youth activist.\n\nThe weekend MJ was killed still haunts her. She and MJ were in Chicago for Labor Day weekend, visiting from Alabama so he could spend time with his father, Mychal Moultry Sr.\n\nAngela Gregg with her 4-year-old son, Mychal Moultry, Jr., and his father, Mychal Moultry, Sr. Courtesy Angela Gregg\n\nAs MJ and his dad were bonding and getting their hair braided in a family friend’s Woodlawn apartment, bullets flew through the window, hitting the boy twice in the head. That same holiday weekend, five other people were killed and at least 61 others injured in gun violence throughout the city.\n\nJust days later, Gregg and Moultry Sr. were making funeral arrangements.\n\nWhen a family loses a child to gun violence, funeral costs can present further hardship and pain. In April, the Illinois House and Senate overwhelmingly passed the Mychal Moultry Jr. Funeral and Burial Assistance Act, in which the state provides funeral and burial payment assistance to low-income families for children under the age of 17 who are murdered by gun violence.\n\nGregg says it was great to see the state absolve some of the financial burden, but she wants to see legislators focused more on preventing gun violence in the first place so there aren’t any funerals that need to be paid for.\n\n“It’s two completely different worlds,” Gregg says. “We were able to get that legislation moved within about six or seven months after MJ passed, but the laws to actually prevent this from happening in the first place, they’re still in limbo.”\n\nGregg says people are becoming desensitized to gun violence in Chicago and the impact it has on youth, families and the broader community.\n\nBrooks says he wants Black and Brown youth in neighborhoods like Woodlawn to live in safe environments and grow to reach their full potential. If the same level of care and compassion was being shown in Chicago’s South and West sides as in Highland Park, he says there would be more resources and solutions directed toward the communities to combat gun violence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Highland Park mass shooting, community members left behind strollers, lawn chairs, bikes, shoes, toys, blankets and more. In Chicago’s South and West sides, Grooms says tangible items are not what’s lost when mass shootings happen in the community nearly every day.\n\n“What’s left behind is innocence, what’s left behind is sensitivity, what’s left behind is hope, what’s left behind most of all this justice,” Grooms says. “We don’t get justice for our babies and our teenagers that are shot and killed, and it’s very rare that we see the people that kill someone be brought to justice.”", "authors": ["Jacquelyne Germain"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}]}

The colonists formally declared their independence on July 2, which John Adams promptly called “the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America,” predicting that it “will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival.”\n\nAs Independence Day draws near, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at who the 56 signers of the Declaration were. We drew on sources such as USHistory.org, the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association to compile our list.\n\nIt was on July 4, however, that the Continental Congress approved the final text of the Declaration – after jointly making some 86 changes in the draft composed by Thomas Jefferson and four colleagues.\n\nCooking out? America, you're grilling your burgers wrong and it could kill you\n\nDogs and fireworks:Scared pets 'think they're going to die' on the Fourth of July\n\nBut that still wasn’t when this seminal document of our nation was signed. That happened, for the most part, on Aug. 2 – but at least five signers didn’t affix their signatures to the Declaration until the following weeks.\n\nAll those who signed the Declaration were delegates to the Second Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia. The Congress was a convention of representatives from the various colonies. The first one, held in 1774, sought to ease rising tensions between the British and the colonists, while safeguarding the rights of the latter.\n\nThe second Congress, which met from 1775 through 1781, was more radical, and ultimately decided that full independence from Great Britain was essential. Thomas Jefferson was charged with overseeing the drafting of a declaration to that effect. (Jefferson, of course, went on to become our third president, and is in the top ten when historians rank every president.)\n\nThe Congress also appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, which was already involved in battles with the British in what grew into the Revolutionary War – one of the most expensive wars in U.S. history.\n\nThere’s little doubt what occasion Pennsylvania would claim in a listing of the most important historical event in every state.\n\nThe majority of the delegates – all of them men – who signed the Declaration had been born in one of the 13 colonies, though a few were native to Great Britain or Ireland. Many were gentleman farmers, and many – sometimes the same ones – were attorneys. Most were well-to-do, though some lost their fortunes during the Revolutionary War or subsequently.\n\nSome of the signers are world famous – among them Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams – and some are obscure. The majority owned slaves – 41 of the 56, according to one study – though there were also ardent abolitionists among their number. Some came to bad ends; one lived to the age of 95.\n\nWhoever they were, one thing is certain: These 56 signers put their lives and livelihoods on the line for the cause of American independence, and without their actions we’d have nothing to celebrate as a nation – on the Fourth of July or any other date.\n\nInformation about the signers of the Declaration of Independence was drawn from USHistory.org, which is the website of the non-profit Philadelphia-based Independence Hall Association, as well as from the websites of The Society of the Descendents of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, and the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nJohn Adams (1735-1826)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nOne of the most revered of the Founding Fathers, the man who was to become the first vice president and the second president of the United States (and father of the nation's sixth president, John Quincy Adams) was a noted attorney, an active member of the Continental Congress, and an outspoken opponent of slavery. In 1783, he helped develop, and signed, the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nSamuel Adams (1722-1803)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nA cousin of John Adams, Samuel Adams has been described as \"an excellent politician, an unsuccessful brewer, and a poor businessman.\" (Despite his apparent lack of brewing success, the Boston Beer Company's popular Samuel Adams brand is named after him.) A leading advocate for independence and a close friend of writer and intellectual Tom Paine, Adams was known as an eloquent orator.\n\nJosiah Bartlett (1729-1795)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nMassachusetts-born Bartlett studied medicine and set up a practice as a doctor in Kingston, New Hampshire. Elected to represent the New Hampshire Colony at the Continental Congress, he was the second person to sign the Declaration of Independence, after John Hancock. He later became governor of the new state of New Hampshire.\n\nCarter Braxton (1736-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nComing from a wealthy plantation family, Braxton became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America, before being named to the Virginia delegation to the Continental Congress. He subsequently served in the U.S. Congress. Braxton, who is known to have had as many as 18 children, made poor financial decisions after serving in Congress and died penniless.\n\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton (1737-1832)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nCarroll was born into a wealthy Annapolis family, and shipped off to be educated in France at the age of 8. He returned to America 20 years later, after subsequent studies in London, and promptly became active in the patriot cause. He held numerous offices in Maryland, both before and after independence, and helped frame the Maryland constitution. He signed the Declaration of Independence as \"Charles Carroll of Carrollton,\" a form of his name that he used to distinguish himself from a number of other Maryland Charles Carrolls. He was the last survivor of the signers, dying at the age of 95.\n\nSamuel Chase (1741-1811)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nClassically educated in Baltimore, Chase had a long and distinguished legal career in Maryland, becoming chief justice of the state supreme court and then an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. He held that post from 1796 until his death in 1811. In the course of his tenure, he became the only Supreme Court justice to ever face impeachment proceedings, brought by Thomas Jefferson and his followers after he resisted Jefferson's attempt to weaken federal judicial powers. His acquittal by the Senate was considered a victory for judicial independence.\n\nAbraham Clark (1725-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA self-taught surveyor and lawyer, born in what is now the New Jersey city of Elizabeth, Clark became locally popular by representing poor farmers in land disputes. He held a number of regional offices before being sent to the Continental Congress as a representative of New Jersey. He served in Congress throughout the Revolutionary War, and after retiring continued to be active in community politics.\n\nGeorge Clymer (1739-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nClymer was a merchant, born in Philadelphia, who became active politically after the British government imposed the unpopular Tea Act and Stamp Act on the colonies. He was an avid supporter of George Washington as both a general and a politician. In retirement, Clymer became the first president of the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts and of the Philadelphia Bank.\n\nWilliam Ellery (1727-1820)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nBorn in Newport and educated at Harvard College, graduating at the age of 15, Ellery worked as a merchant, a customs collector, and the clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly before settling on a career in law. After the Revolutionary War, he became an outspoken anti-slavery activist.\n\nWilliam Floyd (1734-1821)\n\n• State: New York\n\nFloyd was born into a prosperous farm family of Welsh descent. He became a soldier in the Suffolk County Militia, and was later elected to the first U.S. Congress under the new constitution. In 1808, he became a state senator. His family's estate is now part of the Fire Island National Seashore.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nThe protean Boston-born Franklin, one of the most famous of the signers, was a businessman, inventor, writer, printer, publisher, scientist, diplomat, and legislator. He was the first postmaster general of the United States and a minister to the French court. A major force in the rebellion against the British, he helped Jefferson draft the Declaration of Independence. Though he owned slaves and initially believed that blacks were inferior to white Europeans, his views evolved and he became a major supporter of the abolitionist cause.\n\nElbridge Gerry (1744-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nIn addition to his service in the Continental Congress and as an envoy to France, as governor of his home state of Massachusetts, and as James Madison's vice president, Gerry has another political distinction: When he was governor, he redrew the map of Massachusetts voting districts to favor his own political party. The Boston Globe ran a cartoon depicting the redrawn districts in the shape of a salamander, with the caption \"The Gerrymander\" – thus giving birth to a term used to this day to mean the manipulation of district boundaries to favor one political faction.\n\nButton Gwinnett (1735-1777)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nGwinnett was born in Gloucestershire, England, to Welsh parents, and moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 1762. He went on to establish a large plantation in neighboring Georgia, and became commander of Georgia's Continental Battalion. Gwinnett and one Laclan McIntosh became bitter political rivals, representing opposing factions in Georgia's patriot movement. In 1777, McIntosh denounced Gwinnett in the Georgia Assembly as \"a scoundrel and a lying rascal\" – prompting Gwinnett to challenge him to a duel. The men shot each other, but McIntosh recovered while Gwinnett died of his wounds three days later.\n\nLyman Hall (1724-1790)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nHall was born in Connecticut and studied medicine at Yale. He set up a practice in Charleston, South Carolina, moved to Georgia to establish a plantation, returned to practice medicine in Charleston, and then settled again in Georgia – where he began helping to provision the Revolutionary Army. After the war, he was elected to Georgia's House of Assembly and later became governor of the state.\n\nJohn Hancock (1737-1793)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nHancock, a Massachusetts native who studied business at Harvard College, was the first man to sign the Declaration of Independence. With plenty of room in the document, he inscribed his name large and with dramatic flourishes. \"I guess King George will be able to read that!\" he reportedly exclaimed. His name stands out so vividly on the Declaration that \"John Hancock\" became a synonym for \"signature\" (as in \"Put your John Hancock right there\"). His revolutionary activities included delivering a stirring oration commemorating the Boston Massacre and support of the Boston Tea Party, and he served as both the president of the Continental Congress and the governor of Massachusetts.\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1726-1791)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe father of William Henry Harrison, the ninth U.S. president, Harrison was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and after independence, served five years as governor of his native Virginia. In his time, he was known as one of Virginia's wealthiest men. His descendants included two U.S. presidents: William Henry Harrison; and one of his great-grandsons, a later Benjamin Harrison, became our 23rd president.\n\nJohn Hart (1711-1779)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nA successful farmer, Hart entered public service as a justice of the peace and was subsequently elected to the New Jersey Assembly. In 1778, he invited some 12,000 of George Washington's troops to camp on his farm to rest before resuming their battles with the British. Washington lunched with Hart before holding his July 12 Council of War nearby, at which the general planned his attack on Staten Island.\n\nJoseph Hewes (1730-1779)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, and educated at what was then called Princeton College, Hewes moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, and established a successful shipping business. He was known as the leading expert in maritime affairs in the Continental Congress, and placed his ships at the disposal of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. He later became secretary of the congressional Naval Affairs Committee. The Liberty ship SS Joseph Hewes, which served in World War II, was named in his honor.\n\nThomas Heyward, Jr. (1746-1809)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Heyward studied law in both England and America, becoming one of the earliest advocates of the patriot cause in South Carolina. To the dismay of his father, who feared that the British would hang him in retaliation, Heyward signed the Declaration of Independence just after his 30th birthday, and went on to join the South Carolina Militia as a captain of artillery. He later served as a judge in his native state for 15 years before retiring.\n\nWilliam Hooper (1742-1790)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard, where he studied law, Hooper settled in the North Carolina town of Wilmington in 1767. He served for two years in the Continental Congress, and became a judge of the Federal Court after independence before retiring in ill health. He died young, at 48.\n\nStephen Hopkins (1707-1785)\n\n• State: Rhode Island\n\nApparently self-educated, Hopkins was politically active as a young man but also became a successful shipbuilder, credited with helping to transform Providence into a major commercial center. He and his friend Benjamin Franklin were the two oldest signers. Hopkins was also a cousin of the traitorous Benedict Arnold.\n\nFrancis Hopkinson (1737-1791)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn into a wealthy Philadelphia family, Hopkinson studied law there and in England, and held several judgeships in Pennsylvania, though he represented New Jersey at the Constitutional Convention. He was an accomplished writer and composer, whose works included a satirical anti-British ballad, set to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle,\" called \"Battle of the Kegs.\" He also claimed credit for designing the American flag, though the claim has been disputed.\n\nSamuel Huntington (1731-1796)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA self-taught lawyer born in the Connecticut town of Windham, Huntington was successively an attorney, tax collector, town-meeting moderator, and justice of the peace in nearby Norwich, going on to hold several higher offices in the colony. After independence, he became lieutenant-governor and chief superior court judge in Connecticut, and for a decade was its governor. He is credited with helping to build roads and develop industry in the state.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy hosted an assemblage of Nobel Prize winners from around the Western Hemisphere at the White House in 1962, he remarked \"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\" A lawyer, farmer, scientist, musician, architect, inventor, author, and quintessential politician, he served variously as governor of Virginia, minister to the French court, secretary of state, vice president (under John Adams), and ultimately the third president of the United States. He was also the principal author of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nOne of the only pair of brothers to sign the Declaration of Independence, Lee was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in British North America and a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment later dissolved by the British. (It continued to meet in secret at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.) He was an associate of Patrick (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\") Henry and later served in the Virginia Senate.\n\nRichard Henry Lee (1732-1794)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nA signer with his brother, Francis, Lee was likewise a radical member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Lee was elected to attend the first Continental Congress in 1774. He was to become the first state senator from Virginia under the newly formed U.S. government.\n\nFrancis Lewis (1713-1802)\n\n• State: New York\n\nLewis was born in Wales and educated in Scotland and England, then worked as a merchant in London before emigrating to New York to set up his own business in 1734. He subsequently entered into international trade, making several trans-Atlantic voyages and surviving two shipwrecks off the coast of Ireland. Though he grew wealthy, he turned his attentions to radical causes and, along with fellow signer Philip Livingston, contracted to supply arms and ammunition to the rebellious colonists.\n\nPhilip Livingston (1716-1778)\n\n• State: New York\n\nBorn in Albany and educated at Yale, Livingston became a prosperous merchant and alderman in New York City. He was a strong supporter of independence in the Continental Congress, and continued to serve in that body after being elected to the New York State Senate in 1777. Livingston was also one of the founders of King's College, which became Columbia University.\n\nThomas Lynch, Jr. (1749-1779)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nOne of the two youngest signers, along with Edward Rutledge – both were 26 – Lynch attended Cambridge University in England and studied law in London. Back home, he was elected to the Continental Congress, but fell ill shortly after signing the Declaration. Late in 1776, he and his wife sailed for the West Indies, but the ship disappeared and neither was ever heard from again.\n\nThomas McKean (1734-1817)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nThe Pennsylvania-born McKean held an astonishing number of positions in both that state and Delaware over the course of his career, including member of the Delaware Assembly, Delaware delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, collector of Customs and commissioner of revenue for New Castle County (Delaware), delegate to the Continental Congress, president of Delaware, and both chief justice and later governor of the new state of Pennsylvania.\n\nArthur Middleton (1742-1787)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nBorn in Charleston but educated at Cambridge University in England, Middleton traveled around Europe for three years before returning to South Carolina, where he was elected to the provincial House of Commons. He was active in the defense of Charleston against the British, but was captured and spent a year imprisoned. After the war, he served in the state legislature and was one of the original trustees of Charleston College.\n\nLewis Morris (1726-1798)\n\n• State: New York\n\nMorris was born on his family's farm estate, Morrisania, in what is now the Bronx, and studied at Yale. While a delegate to the Continental Congress, he also served as a brigadier general in the New York Militia. He went on to become a member of the New York legislature after independence. When the federal government was considering possible sites for a permanent national capital, he proposed that they consider Morrisania – citing as one of its advantages that its location meant it could \"be amply protected by the hardy sons of New England on the one side, and the inhabitants of the populous City of New York on the other.\"\n\nRobert Morris (1734-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in England but arriving in America at the age of 10, Morris became a wealthy importer and businessman in Philadelphia. Financially acute, he was a major force in securing financing for the Revolutionary War, and after independence he created a national bank that became the Bank of North America. This was credited with bringing economic stability to the new nation and establishing its financial credibility abroad. Washington tried to appoint him as the first secretary of the treasury, but he declined and suggested Alexander Hamilton for the post instead.\n\nJohn Morton (1724-1777)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nA Pennsylvania native, Morton held a number of civic offices there, including justice of the peace, high sheriff, and associate judge of the supreme court. He became chairman of the committee that wrote the Articles of Confederation – which served as the first constitution of the newly formed republic until it was supplanted by the present-day Constitution in 1787.\n\nThomas Nelson, Jr. (1738-1789)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nEducated in England, Nelson was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and a co-founder of the Virginia Militia, becoming its first commander and continuing his military career after being elected to the Continental Congress. When Thomas Jefferson declined to run for reelection as governor of Virginia in 1781, Nelson replaced him, still retaining his leadership of the Militia.\n\nWilliam Paca (1740-1799)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nThe son of a wealthy planter, Paca earned a master's degree from Philadelphia College at the age of 18 and a license to practice law at 21. He became friendly with another Maryland signer, Samuel Chase, and the two became among the leading anti-British voices in the region. He was elected as governor of the state of Maryland after independence, and George Washington appointed him as chief justice of the state's U.S. District Court.\n\nRobert Treat Paine (1731-1814)\n\n• State: Massachusetts\n\nBoston-born and educated at Harvard College, Paine worked as a teacher before shipping out on a series of trading and whaling voyages that took him as far afield as Greenland and Spain. Back on dry land, he became a lawyer, and for a time was a friendly rival to another lawyer, John Adams. Paine was known in the Continental Congress as the \"Objection Maker,\" because he frequently objected to the proposals of other members.\n\nJohn Penn (1741-1788)\n\n• State: North Carolina\n\nA native of Virginia, where he was licensed to practice law at the age of 22, Penn moved to North Carolina in 1774, setting up a practice and becoming politically active. Besides serving in the Continental Congress, he sat on the Board of War, which oversaw military affairs during the Revolutionary War.\n\nGeorge Read (1733-1798)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn in colonial Maryland, Read studied law in Philadelphia, passing the bar at the age of 20, and later moved to Delaware. He became president of Delaware's Constitutional Convention in 1776. After Delaware became the first state in the fledgling Union, he was elected state senator twice and then appointed chief justice of the State of Delaware, a position he held until his death.\n\nCaesar Rodney (1728-1784)\n\n• State: Delaware\n\nBorn on the family farm in the Delaware Colony, Rodney was never formally educated. Nonetheless, he had a distinguished career that included participation in the Colonial Assembly and the Stamp Act Congress, as well as the Continental Congress. He later served as president of the state of Delaware and a member of the state assembly.\n\nGeorge Ross (1730-1779)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Delaware, Ross passed the bar in Philadelphia at the age of 20, subsequently becoming attorney general for the Pennsylvania community of Carlisle. He was elected to the Continental Congress three times, and in 1779, shortly before his death, was appointed as a judge for the Pennsylvania Court of Admiralty, which heard cases involving maritime law.\n\nBenjamin Rush (1745-1813)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvanian Rush was a physician and educator, who studied medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, and spent several years around Europe studying languages, medicine, and science. Back in America, he was appointed surgeon general to an arm of the Continental Army. In his final years, he served dual roles as treasurer of the U.S. Mint and professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. When he died at the age of 68, he was considered the most celebrated physician in the country.\n\nEdward Rutledge (1749-1800)\n\n• State: South Carolina\n\nEducated at Oxford University and a member of the English bar, Rutledge was one of the two youngest signers, along with Thomas Lynch Jr., (both were 26 at the time). He left the Continental Congress to serve in the Charleston Battalion of Artillery, helping to defend the city against the British. After the war, he was resolute in pursuing the prosecution of British loyalists, and became governor of South Carolina in 1789.\n\nRoger Sherman (1721-1793)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA farmer and (some sources say) shoemaker who became a surveyor and then a lawyer, Sherman entered politics as a member of the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1776, he served on the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, and later became a forceful advocate for the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. According to James Madison, he delivered 138 separate speeches at the Constitutional Convention, and Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams are all said to have held him in high regard.\n\nJames Smith (1719-1806)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in Dublin, Ireland, Smith moved to Pennsylvania with his family as a pre-teen. He later apprenticed at the law offices of his older brother, passed the Pennsylvania Bar, and set up a business in which he alternated practicing law with surveying. He was elected to the Continental Congress twice, but the second time he declined the position, citing his advanced age of 66.\n\nRichard Stockton (1730-1781)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nSaid to have been one of the most successful lawyers in the colonies, Stockton became a justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court two years before signing the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he was captured and jailed for several years under abusive conditions by the British – during which time the British ransacked his estate and burned his extensive library.\n\nThomas Stone (1743-1787)\n\n• State: Maryland\n\nStone worked in Thomas Jefferson's law office before starting his own practice, and was also a prosperous landowner. Little is known about his tenure in the Continental Congress, as he gave few speeches there, and no papers relating to his life have been discovered. Grieving after the death of his wife in 1787, he planned to sail for England, but he died himself in Alexandria while awaiting the arrival of his ship.\n\nGeorge Taylor (1716-1781)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn in what is now Northern Ireland, Taylor came to America when he was in his early 20s, becoming an ironmaster – the man in charge of a forge. Though not known for being particularly active politically, he held several elected positions, including a stint in the Continental Congress. In 1775, he was appointed to take the place of a Pennsylvanian delegate who refused to support the break with Britain. He missed the vote, but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMatthew Thornton (1714-1803)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nThe Irish-born Thornton came to America with his parents at the age of three. Educated in Massachusetts, he studied medicine and became a physician in New Hampshire. After independence was declared, he was tasked with drawing up a plan of government for that new state. This became New Hampshire's first constitution, as well as the first post-independence constitution adopted by any state. He missed the debates over independence at the Continental Congress but arrived in time to sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\nGeorge Walton (1741-1804)\n\n• State: Georgia\n\nVirginia-born, Walton apprenticed as a carpenter as a young man, then moved to Savannah, Georgia, to study law, being admitted to the Bar in 1774. He was an ally of Lachlan McIntosh in his rivalry with another Georgia signer, Button Gwinnett, and was censured for supporting McIntosh in the duel that claimed Gwinnett's life. He served briefly as governor of Georgia after independence, then became chief justice of the state, followed by another, longer, term as governor. His last political position was as a U.S. senator.\n\nWilliam Whipple (1730-1785)\n\n• State: New Hampshire\n\nBorn in Maine, Whipple became a seaman, earning the position of ship's master – in effect a captain – at the age of 21. Eight years later, he landed at Portsmouth on the New Hampshire coast and established a business as a merchant. He became politically active and served in the Continental Congress until taking a leave to serve as brigadier general in the New Hampshire Militia during the Revolutionary War.\n\nWilliam Williams (1731-1811)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nA Harvard-educated merchant, Williams held the post of town clerk in Lebanon, Connecticut, for 44 years, also serving as selectman and becoming speaker of the house in the colonial legislature. Brought in to replace another Continental Congress member, Oliver Wolcott, who had fallen ill, he arrived too late to vote for independence, but in time to sign the Declaration.\n\nJames Wilson (1742-1798)\n\n• State: Pennsylvania\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Wilson emigrated to America in 1766, studying law and being admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. In 1774, he wrote a pamphlet arguing that the British Parliament had no legal authority over the colonies. It was influential on members of the Continental Congress, to which he was subsequently elected. He later served as a director of the Bank of North America, a member of the Constitutional Convention, and an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJohn Witherspoon (1723-1794)\n\n• State: New Jersey\n\nBorn and educated in Scotland, Witherspoon was brought to America to serve as president of the College of New Jersey – now Princeton University – under the auspices of two other signers, Richard Stockton and Benjamin Rush. When another delegate to the Constitutional Convention suggested that the colonies weren't yet ripe for independence, he famously replied that they were \"not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.\"\n\nOliver Wolcott (1726-1797)\n\n• State: Connecticut\n\nThe youngest of the 14 children of colonial Connecticut governor Roger Wolcott, Wolcott was educated at Yale, raised a militia to fight in the French and Indian War, and was appointed sheriff of Connecticut's Litchfield County. Returning to military life, he became a colonel in the Connecticut Militia and later brigadier general of Connecticut forces in the Continental Armies. Though too ill to attend the Continental Congress and sign the Declaration of Independence in August of 1776, he added his signature in the fall of that year.\n\nGeorge Wythe (1726-1806)\n\n• State: Virginia\n\nThe scion of a wealthy agricultural family, Wythe studied law and was admitted to the bar in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, at the age of 20. A member of the House of Burgesses and one-time attorney general of Virginia, he became America's first law professor, at the College of William and Mary – where his students included Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Marshall. After independence, he freed his slaves and willed part of his family property to one of them – which spurred his disinherited grandnephew to fatally poison both the man and Wythe.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The day has had a fascinating history ever since, rife with quirky coincidences and inventive celebrations.\n\nWant to impress your friends and family at this year's Fourth of July gathering? Check out these facts you might not have known about the holiday.\n\n1. Congress didn't actually vote for independence on July 4.\n\nTwelve of thirteen states approved a resolution for independence on July 2, not July 4, when the declaration was actually adopted. New York didn't vote until July 9. Many of the signers didn't attach their names to the document until August 2.\n\nJohn Adams famously insisted the annual celebration of independence be held July 2, not July 4, and refused to attend any events on the latter day.\n\n2. The Fourth of July didn't become an official holiday until over a century after America declared its independence.\n\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, that American independence should be celebrated with “pomp and Parade…Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other.”\n\nThough early celebrations began the following year, the Fourth of July wasn't designated a federal holiday until 1870. In 1941, it became a paid holiday for federal employees.\n\n3. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington gave his soldiers a special treat for the holiday.\n\nOn July 4, 1778, George Washington ordered a double ration of rum for his soldiers. He also ordered a cannon salute to celebrate the occasion.\n\nDrinking was a large part of historical Fourth of July celebrations — it was traditional to drink 13 toasts, one for each state in the union.\n\n4. In a bizarre coincidence, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both died on July 4, 1826 — the nation's 50th birthday.\n\nThe two founding fathers and political adversaries died within five hours of each other.\n\nAs Adams lay on his deathbed, unaware that Jefferson had died earlier that day in Monticello, he reportedly spoke his last words: \"Jefferson still survives\".\n\nJames Monroe was the third president to die on July 4: he passed away in 1831.\n\n5. Calvin Coolidge is the only president to be born on July 4.\n\nCoolidge, the 30th U.S. president, was born on Independence Day in 1872.\n\nOther July 4 birthdays include first daughter Malia Obama, gangster Meyer Lansky, author Nathaniel Hawthorne, and reality TV star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino.\n\n6. The United States isn't the only country to celebrate independence on July 4.\n\nThe Philippines gained its independence from U.S. colonial control on July 4, 1946, and the day became a national holiday.\n\nIn 1962, however, the day was changed to June 12 in light of rising Filipino nationalism and resentment toward prior American colonialism. July 4 remains on the books as \"Philippine Republic Day,\" but isn't widely observed.\n\n7. Celebrating with fireworks is as old as the holiday itself.\n\nAt the first Fourth of July celebrations, which took place in Philadelphia in 1777, revelers fired a cannon 13 times, once for each colony. That night, 13 fireworks were fired off from the city's commons.\n\nThe tradition has only blossomed since then. In 1934, an explorer in Antarctica set off fireworks to celebrate the holiday in relatively warm weather for the continent: 33 degrees below zero.\n\n8. And today, fireworks are a massive industry.\n\nAccording to the American Pyrotechnics Association, Americans spent over $1 billion on fireworks in 2017. That number has roughly tripled over the last 20 years.\n\n9. July 4 is the biggest hot dog day of the year.\n\nAmericans consume roughly 150 million hot dogs on the Fourth of July — enough to stretch from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles five times.\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, which is over a century old, takes place July 4 every year. The record, currently held by Joey Chestnut, is 72 hot dogs in 10 minutes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/03"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/07/02/president-coolidges-150th-birthday-is-coming-on-the-4th-of-july/65364677007/", "title": "President Coolidge's 150th birthday is coming on the 4th of July", "text": "What better day for a president of the United States to be born than the Fourth of Jul. Yet only one was so lucky: Vermont's own Calvin Coolidge, born in Plymouth Notch on that day in 1872.\n\nOn Monday, the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch is hosting a celebration of Coolidge's 150th birthday, beginning at 10 a.m. and continuing through 5 p.m.\n\n\"Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,\" Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release.\n\nThe pomp will begin at noon on Monday on the village green in Plymouth Notch, when a Vermont National Guard delegation will lead a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House will be placed at Coolidge's gravesite.\n\nThere will also be Coolidge birthday cake to enjoy and a string band to listen to. You can still see Plymouth Artisan Cheese being made in an 1890 factory built by John Coolidge, the president's father, and watch The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation.\n\n\"Our family enjoys participating in the simple ceremony marking President Coolidge's birth on July 4th and especially this year being the 150th anniversary,\" Christopher Coolidge Jeter, President Coolidge's great grandson, said in a news release. \"It allows us time to pause and honor the contributions he made during his life. As much as things have changed since the 1900s, many of Coolidge's speeches and ideals are as relevant now as ever.\"\n\nCalvin Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, taking the place of his predecessor Warren Harding when Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack and Coolidge was vice president. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election.\n\nThe President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes Coolidge's boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family's cheese factory and his father's store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924. There is also Coolidge State Park, covering 216 acres of preserved village and farmland. There are limited options for food in Plymouth Notch, so visitors are encouraged to bring a picnic.\n\nContact Dan D’Ambrosio at 802-660-1841 or ddambrosio@freepressmedia.com.

The unity for which President Joe Biden pleaded in his inaugural address seems more elusive than ever.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cheney says January 6 committee could issue criminal referral for Trump 02:20 - Source: CNN\n\nUS democracy is still fighting for its survival, as the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol reveals ever more frightening details of Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 election. The ex-President is, meanwhile, impatient to launch a 2024 campaign rooted in his election fraud lies that would highlight his increasingly autocratic tendencies.\n\nIn another example of startling political disruption, an activist Supreme Court, protected behind high metal fences in its marbled Washington chambers, just stripped away the constitutional right of millions of women to have an abortion. The decision validates a half-century campaign by conservative activists, many of whom have sincere moral objections against abortion, which they equate with the murder of an unborn child.\n\nBut the Supreme Court’s decision and the emerging patchwork system of abortion restrictions across the US have been met with outrage in other parts of America. On Sunday, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential Republican presidential candidate, defended her state’s abortion ban on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked whether a 10-year-old girl who was raped should be forced to give birth, or to explain how her state will care for women deprived of the right to end a pregnancy. Her evasions encapsulated how many supporters of abortion rights see hypocrisy and inhumanity among some of those who profess to care for life – and the irreconcilable divide on this issue in the country.\n\nGiven the political discord boiling way beneath the surface of Monday’s national celebrations, it’s hardly surprising that a staggering 85% of US adults in an Associated Press-NORC poll released last week said things in the country are headed in the wrong direction. The survey formalized what is obvious: for all its advantages, abundant resources, comparative prosperity and history of working to perfect its democracy, the United States is not a country at ease with itself right now. The cliché that America’s best days are ahead is becoming harder to believe.\n\nMore reasons for gloom\n\nSocial tensions are being exacerbated by economic pressure.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is making food bills more expensive and spiked gasoline to record prices. Biden’s struggling presidency appears out of ideas as to how to help after potentially worsening the situation by pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of spending into the economy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden: 'The reason gas prices are up is because of Russia' 01:29 - Source: CNN\n\nGun crime in cities is recalling a more violent past and every Monday brings a grim accounting of the weekend’s mass shootings. In the latest tragic outburst of violence, at least six people were killed and two dozen were injured at a shooting at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park on Monday. The exact circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear Monday afternoon as authorities launched a search for the perpetrator.\n\nThe sense of a country politically on edge is being exacerbated by the shadow of Trump’s violent coup attempt.\n\nA flurry of restrictions on voting in many conservative-led states and the GOP’s refusal to renew voting rights legislation harken back to a poisoned era of racial repression. Liberals who once dreamed of a new Franklin Roosevelt are dissatisfied with the results of their narrow monopoly on political power in Biden’s Washington. But their radicalism also risks alienating the crucial middle ground of voters who ought to be up for grabs as the GOP dives right.\n\nIncredibly, the country is struggling to make enough infant formula to feed its babies – and is having to fly in emergency supplies from abroad – a metaphor if there ever was one for a time when things just don’t seem to be going very well.\n\nAnd in some regions, the spectacles that bring Americans of all persuasions side by side – the July Fourth fireworks shows – are being dampened by bans imposed because the land is tinderbox dry because of global warming, another threat that defies a political consensus for action.\n\nA deeply divided nation\n\nAlmost every day, there’s a controversy or political fight that underscores the antagonism between more moderate, diverse and socially tolerant American cities and suburbs and the conservatism of rural America.\n\nMany leaders on both sides of the aisle accentuate differences for political gain, only adding to the sense of anger coursing through the country. Elected leaders who seek to bring those with divergent views together are an endangered species.\n\nIncreasingly, for those who think about politics, each side of the divide sees the other as an existentialist threat to their idea of America – a schism of perception especially demonstrated in recent weeks by the fight between supporters and opponents of abortion rights.\n\nOn the right, disillusionment with government itself – which fueled Trump’s rise and is being exacerbated by his election fraud lies – is a driving force in a Republican Party that is giving up on democracy.\n\nOn the left, more and more people see a Supreme Court that is openly flouting majority opinion as illegitimate. The high court was once seen as above the partisan flames. But even its justices have been caught up in a tide of fury, with sniping more characteristic of social media than Supreme Court opinions. During oral arguments before last month’s landmark overturning of Roe v. Wade, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered whether the court could “survive the stench” of stripping away abortion rights. In his majority opinion that did just that, Justice Samuel Alito relished dismissing the reasoning behind Roe as “egregiously wrong.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Justice Samuel Alito? 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Supreme Court was once seen as a moderating force for stability. But in its new zeal for ripping up precedents, the conservative majority has turned it into yet another destabilizing force in society.\n\nReasons for hope\n\nSo what grounds are there for hope this Independence Day? Biden is insisting that things are not as bad as they seem, seeking to fulfill that part of a president’s duties that involve bucking the country up.\n\n“You haven’t found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards,” the President insisted as he wrapped up a visit to Europe last week.\n\n“America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world,” he said, while being somewhat economical with the truth when it comes to the spike in inflation that he once dismissed.\n\nBiden, of course, has an interest in painting things in a better light than they are, especially with midterm elections approaching in which Democrats are likely to suffer from his sub-40% approval rating.\n\nBut it’s not all darkness. Biden has piloted the United States out of the depths of the pandemic recession. Prices might be high and consuming wage gains, but unemployment is around 50-year lows. This could cushion the impact of a recession many experts fear is on the way.\n\nHindsight showed that Biden’s declaration of partial independence from Covid-19 last July Fourth was premature – and politically unwise. But life is far closer to normal than it was a year ago and the United States is better prepared to handle any resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall. There are plenty of vaccinations to go around, though again, politics appears to be threatening the common good with refusal to take such precautions a badge of honor among some grassroots conservatives.\n\nWashington may not be as irredeemably broken as it seems. Since last year, Republicans and Democrats have combined to pass a huge new law fixing the country’s aging infrastructure – a task that evaded recent presidents before Biden. And after a deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Senate passed one of the most sweeping firearms safety laws in a generation. The measure might have fallen far short of the pleas of grief-stricken family members of the mass shooting victims in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But it was a sign that even in this vicious political climate, incremental change fashioned through political institutions is not impossible.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, Americans are not fighting major wars abroad. And Biden’s leadership of the West in standing up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may represent the most significant show of American global leadership since the Cold War.\n\nThe bravery of those who stood up to Trump’s attempt to steal power in 2020 is also an inspiration this July Fourth.

Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House January 6 committee, may alienate liberals with her political views, but she’s written herself a place in history by standing up for democracy, unlike many of her genuflecting GOP rivals who run perpetually scared from Trump.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former Trump White House aide, put far more senior colleagues to shame by showing how one person can take a stand for truth with her televised testimony before the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection.\n\nAnd if the majority of the country that didn’t want to see Roe reversed wants an example of turning demoralizing defeat into eventual victory, they can look to the years of activism by the anti-abortion movement to see how political change can be forged by generations of campaigners who stay committed to the goal.\n\nBecause this July Fourth, America still does have a democratic political system that can be shaped by the people.\n\nAt least, it does for now.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/03/july-4th-the-histories-us-flags-for-independence-day/39637697/", "title": "July 4th: The histories of all 27 U.S. flags for Independence Day", "text": "John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe flag of the United States goes by different names – The Stars and Stripes; The Red, White, and Blue; Old Glory; and The Star-Spangled Banner. Regardless of what it is called, the American flag is one of the most recognizable symbols of any country in the world, and the inspiration for our national anthem.\n\nThe first official national flag was approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. The resolution read: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.” Each star represented a state and each stripe represented the 13 colonies that declared independence from Great Britain. The colors of the flag were inherited from British flags and have no official meaning.\n\nSince the founding of the United States in 1776, there have been 27 different versions of the flag featuring the stars and stripes. Each new flag represented the addition of one or more states as the United States grew westward to fulfill what it believed to be its manifest destiny of expansion in North America.\n\nFourth of July:Fireworks sales to top $1.3 billion for this year\n\nAs Independence Day nears, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a look at how each of these 27 flags got that way. We reviewed sites such as usflagdepot.com and various history websites to find out how each state was added to the Union, thus affixing a new star to the flag.\n\nOf the 27 versions of the United States flag, nine flew for only about a year, reflecting the rapid expansion of the nation. Though we have not had a new star since 1960 – Hawaii – we may not be done adding stars. American-owned. territories Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, might be considered for statehood.\n\n1. Thirteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1777 ~ 1795\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797)\n\nThe 13-star flag officially became the U.S. flag on June 14, 1777, and the date is celebrated every year in the United States as Flag Day. Though there is no conclusive proof, Francis Hopkinson, a congressman from New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, is credited with designing the flag. Each star and stripe represented a former British colony.\n\n2. Fifteen-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1795 ~ 1818\n\n• Who was president: George Washington (1789-1797), John Adams (1797-1801), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), James Madison (1809-1817), and James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nTwo stripes and two stars were added to the flag when Vermont and Kentucky became the 14th and 15th states in 1791 and 1792, respectively. The 15-star flag would last for 23 years and five presidents would serve under it. This flag inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" our national anthem, after Key saw the flag continue to fly over Fort McHenry following a British bombardment during the War of 1812.\n\n3. Twenty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1818 ~ 1819\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nWith the westward expansion of the United States and the addition of more states, Congress realized that adding stripes to the flag would be impractical. So Congress passed the Flag Act in 1818, restoring the original 13-stripe design and unveiling the flag with additional stars on July 4. Five stars were added to represent five new states: Tennessee (1796), Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), Indiana (1816), and Mississippi (1817). The 20-star flag became the official flag on April 13, 1818, and it was the first of nine flags to only last about a year.\n\n4. Twenty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1819 ~ 1820\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nJust over a year after the twenty-star flag was introduced, the United States added Illinois to the Union, boosting the number of states to 21. Illinois, where future president Abraham Lincoln began his political career, was admitted on Dec. 3, 1818.\n\n5. Twenty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1820 ~ 1822\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825)\n\nThe number of U.S. states rose to 23 with the admission of Alabama in 1819 and Maine in 1820. The flag became the official U.S. flag on July 4, 1820, and would last two years. President James Monroe was the only president to serve under this flag as well as the previous two flags.\n\n6. Twenty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1822 ~ 1836\n\n• Who was president: James Monroe (1817-1825), John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), and Andrew Jackson (1829-1837)\n\nThe flag expanded to 24 stars with the addition of Missouri in 1821. Missouri, a slave state, was admitted as part of the Missouri Compromise, which sought to achieve a balance of free and slave states during the antebellum period. The compromise included the admission of Maine, a free state, which had separated from Massachusetts and become a state the previous year.\n\n7. Twenty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1836 ~ 1837\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) and Martin Van Buren (1837-1841)\n\nArkansas joined the Union as a slave state on June 15, 1836. Less than a month later, its star was included in the U.S. flag, pushing the state total to 25. Arkansas was part of the Louisiana Purchase and carved out of what became the Missouri Territory to become its own territory.\n\n8. Twenty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1837 ~ 1845\n\n• Who was president: Martin Van Buren (1837-1841), William Henry Harrison (1841), John Tyler (1841-1845), and James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nMichigan was admitted to the Union in 1837 as a free state to help maintain the balance between slave and free states. Michigan's admission had been thwarted because of a border dispute with Ohio – which had been admitted as a state in 1803 – but President Andrew Jackson helped Michigan save face by awarding it land from the Upper Peninsula, and then it was granted statehood, boosting the number of states to 26.\n\n9. Twenty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1845 ~ 1846\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nFlorida, a former possession of the Spanish empire, was admitted to the Union in 1845, raising the total number of U.S. states to 27. It would not remain in the Union for long: Florida would secede in 1861.\n\n10. Twenty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1846 ~ 1847\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIn 1846, the flag would undergo another change, this time because of the admission of Texas. Before becoming the 28th state, the Lone Star state had broken away from Mexico in 1836. It was an independent republic before joining the Union and becoming the biggest state in land mass in the contiguous 48 states.\n\n11. Twenty-Nine Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1847 ~ 1848\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849)\n\nIowa was admitted to the Union on Dec. 28, 1846, as a free state to maintain the balance between free and slave states during the antebellum period. Its star was added to the U.S. flag the following July 4. Originally part of the Louisiana Purchase, Iowa grew dramatically because of its rich farmland. Iowa had been established as a U.S. territory in 1838.\n\n12. Thirty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1848 ~ 1851\n\n• Who was president: James Polk (1845-1849), Zachary Taylor (1849-1850),and Millard Fillmore (1850-1853)\n\nWisconsin became a state on May 29, 1848, adding the 30th star to the U.S. flag less than two months later. Not all residents of Wisconsin were enthusiastic about statehood. They had rejected it four times previously because they were concerned statehood would mean higher taxes.\n\n13. Thirty-One Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1851 ~ 1858\n\n• Who was president: Millard Fillmore (1850-1853), Franklin Pierce (1853-1857), and James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nThe Gold Rush that began with the discovery of the precious metal in 1848 helped fast-track California to statehood in 1850. California became the 31st star on the American flag the following July 4. The admission of California fulfilled America's manifest destiny of a nation extending from sea to sea.\n\n14. Thirty-Two Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1858 ~ 1859\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861)\n\nOn the eve of the Civil War, Minnesota was admitted to the Union on May 11, 1858, and represented as the 32nd state on the flag less than two months later. Minnesota was admitted as a free state.\n\n15. Thirty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1859 ~ 1861\n\n• Who was president: James Buchanan (1857-1861) and Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nAmerica's expansion surged to the Northwest with the admission of Oregon on Feb. 14, 1859, adding a 33rd star to the flag the following July. Oregon, which had become a U.S. territory in 1848, was admitted as a free state, though its first two senators, Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith, were proslavery Democrats.\n\n16. Thirty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1861 ~ 1863\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865)\n\nKansas became the 34th state to join the Union. Voter fraud over whether the state would be admitted as a slave state or a free state delayed its admission. Kansas joined the Union on Jan. 29, 1861 as a free state, just as the southern states were seceding, and its star was represented on the flag six months later.\n\n17. Thirty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1863 ~ 1865\n\n• Who was president: Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) and Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe onset of the Civil War did not halt the admission of states to the Union. The western part of Virginia was pro-Union and contained many abolitionists. It split from the rest of the state, which had seceded. President Abraham Lincoln was unsure about dividing Virginia and admitting the western portion as a separate state. He agreed to its admission on the grounds that West Virginia's action was an act of secession in favor of the Constitution. West Virginia joined the Union on June 20, 1863, and a new flag on July 4 included the 35th state.\n\n18. Thirty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1865 ~ 1867\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)\n\nThe Civil War was engulfing the nation when Nevada was admitted as the 36th state on Oct. 31, 1864, and the 36th star on the U.S. flag the following July. Nevada was pro-Union and President Abraham Lincoln saw Nevada's admission as a way to buttress support for the war. To speed up statehood, Nevada sent its entire state constitution to Washington, D.C. – 175 pages – by telegram.\n\n19. Thirty-Seven Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1867 ~ 1877\n\n• Who was president: Andrew Johnson (1865-1869), Ulysses S. Grant (1869-1877), and Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881)\n\nNebraska was the first state to be admitted to the Union after the Civil War. After the Civil War, rapid economic development accelerated by the growth of railroads helped speed Nebraska's admission to the Union on March 1, 1867, becoming the nation's 37th state and the 37th star on the flag.\n\n20. Thirty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1877 ~ 1890\n\n• Who was president: Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881), James A. Garfield (1881), Chester A. Arthur (1881-1885), Grover Cleveland (1885-1889), and Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nColorado, a territory that partially came with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, became the 38th state to join the Union on Aug. 1, 1876. Colorado's admission had been vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, but President Ulysses S. Grant approved it. The 38-star flag would fly for 13 years.\n\n21. Forty-Three Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1890 ~ 1891\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893)\n\nA flurry of state admissions boosted the star total on the flag to 43 by July 4, 1890, as statehood filled out the United States in the high plains and the far west. Five states were admitted to the Union and five stars added to the flag: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington all in 1889, and Idaho in 1890.\n\n22. Forty-Four Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1891 ~ 1896\n\n• Who was president: Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) and Grover Cleveland (1893-1897)\n\nSix states were admitted to the Union when President Benjamin Harrison was president, more than any other president. Wyoming was the last of the six, boosting the number of stars on the flag to 44. Wyoming was admitted on July 10, 1890, even though it was 5,000-people short of the 60,000-person requirement to become a state.\n\n23. Forty-Five Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1896 ~ 1908\n\n• Who was president: Grover Cleveland (1893-1897), William McKinley (1897-1901), and Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)\n\nUtah became a state on Jan. 4, 1896, and the 45th star on the flag later that year. However, the area that would become Utah had been part of the United States since the nation received the territory as part of a treaty that ended the Mexican-American War in 1848. Mormons settled in the area, and their practice of polygamy prevented Utah from becoming a state until Mormons renounced polygamy in the state constitution.\n\n24. Forty-Six Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1908 ~ 1912\n\n• Who was president: Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) and William H. Taft (1909-1913)\n\nOklahoma became the first state to be admitted to the Union in the 20th century, on Nov. 16, 1907, taking its place on the U.S. flag as the 46th star the following year. The United States had used the Oklahoma territory to resettle Native American people, but by the late 19th century, Texas ranchers began moving northward and the federal government decided to open up the territory for homesteaders.\n\n25. Forty-Eight Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1912 ~ 1959\n\n• Who was president: William H. Taft (1909-1913), Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921), Warren Harding (1921-1923), Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929), Herbert Hoover (1929-1933), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945), Harry S.Truman (1945-1953), Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961)\n\nThe southwestern territories of New Mexico and Arizona were the last to join the 48 contiguous states. New Mexico became the 47th state on Jan. 6, 1912, and Arizona attained statehood on Feb. 14, 1912. The 48-star flag flew longer than any other flag before it, 47 years, and eight presidents served under it.\n\n26. Forty-Nine Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1959 ~ 1960\n\n• Who was president: President Eisenhower (1953-1961)\n\nAlaska became the first non-contiguous territory to become a state on Jan. 3, 1959, and the 49th star on the U.S. flag. Alaska, which was purchased from Russia in 1867, is 2.5 times the size of Texas, the second-largest U.S. state. The 49-star flag was the last of the nine flags to fly for just one year.\n\n27. Fifty-Star U.S. Flag\n\n• Years flown: 1960 ~ present\n\n• Who was president: Presidents Eisenhower (1953-1961), John F. Kennedy (1961-1963), Lyndon B. Johnson (1963-1969), Richard M. Nixon (1969-1974), Gerald R. Ford (1974-1977), Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) George H.W. Bush (1989-1993), William Clinton (1993-2001), George W. Bush (2001-2009), Barack Obama (2009-2017), Donald Trump (2017-present)\n\nHawaii is the 50th state, and joined the Union on Aug. 21, 1959. The 50-star flag has flown the longest of any U.S. flag, and in July it will have flown for 59 years. Twelve presidents have served under this flag.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Adams moved into the White House in late 1800.\n\n(Adams, by the way, initially believed Independence Day celebrations would be on July 2, the day the Continental Congress approved a resolution of independence. Over the years, however, Americans began to celebrate July 4, the day the Congress approved the actual document known as the Declaration of Independence.)\n\nIn general, presidents like to meet with large groups of people on July 4. In the early days, they even threw open the doors of the White House to greet members of the public.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the third president and Adams' successor, held the first Fourth of July reception at the Executive Mansion in 1801.\n\nIn more recent times, amid heavy security around the president, White House holiday events are by invitation only.\n\nPresidents also like going to famous places on July 4, Heintze said. Gettysburg, Valley Forge and Philadelphia's Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) have been on holiday presidential schedules.\n\nThe Fourth of July also holds a somber place in presidential history.\n\nAdams and Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Another early president, James Monroe, died on July 4, 1831.\n\nOn a happier note, one president was born on the Fourth of July (Calvin Coolidge in 1872). So was at least one presidential family member: Malia Obama, who turns 16 on Friday.\n\nPresidents have often used the holiday as a call for renewal of the nation's heritage.\n\nAs the nation faced Civil War on July 4, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called an extraordinary session of Congress to discuss the crisis and urge national unity.\n\nEighty years later, with Nazi Germany in control of Western Europe and imperial Japan threatening the Pacific, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a somber address from his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., on July 4, 1941.\n\nThe United States broke from Great Britain to fight for its freedom, Roosevelt said, but \"the fundamentals of 1776 are being struck down abroad and definitely they are threatened here.\"\n\nLittle more than five months later, the United States plunged into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nObama's predecessor, George W. Bush, often discussed the war on terrorism during July 4 events that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On his last Fourth of July as president, in 2008, Bush became the fourth president to visit Jefferson's home at Monticello, Va., where he presided over naturalization ceremonies.\n\nObama, swearing in immigrant service members in 2012, called it \"a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday — the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/politics/illinois-parade-mass-shooting-gun-violence-analysis/index.html", "title": "Illinois mass shooting again shows nowhere is safe from America's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmerica’s latest mass shooting turned a cherished July Fourth parade from a scene of patriotic joy into one of fear and death.\n\nThe rapid bursts of a high-powered rifle brought the chilling reality that no one can be sure they are safe, anywhere, to one of the nation’s most unifying gatherings.\n\nIn that instant, Highland Park joined Uvalde, Columbine, Newtown and Parkland and a long list of cities and towns known across the country for the massacre of innocents in a gun violence contagion that makes the United States an outlier in developed societies.\n\nDetritus strewn at the scene, a lone shoe, discarded backpacks, upturned camping chairs and empty strollers did not just tell the story of the hurried panic of those who fled for their lives. It reflected yet another scene of normality shattered by a mass shooting. In this case, six people who simply went out to celebrate America on its birthday are dead. More than two dozen – aged 8 to 85, according to doctors – are injured.\n\nOnly Monday’s venue – on a day dedicated to national celebration – was variable. Similar horror unfolded in May in an elementary school in Texas and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Mass shootings targeted graduation parties last month in Texas and South Carolina. In Philadelphia, shooters sprayed a nightlife crowd. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there was carnage in a medical center. In Brooklyn, the shooter was on the subway.\n\nTelevision pictures Monday of police vehicles in Highland Park rushing to help beneath a billowing American flag added an ironic, new dimension to this latest horror. It took place as Americans gathered to celebrate the 246th anniversary of the freedoms inherent in American independence. Yet what unfolded encapsulated the quintessentially American cycle of death by firearms. When a gunman killed three people in a mall shooting in Copenhagen, Denmark, over the weekend, it was shocking because it was unusual. But while Monday’s shooting outside Chicago was unexpected, another mass shooting in the US was hardly a surprise.\n\n“It is devastating that a celebration of America was ripped apart by our uniquely American plague,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “A day dedicated to freedom has put into stark relief the one freedom we, as a nation, refuse to uphold: The freedom of our fellow citizens to live without the daily fear of gun violence.”\n\nShocked residents relate a day of terror\n\nStill, residents of the affluent, largely White suburb with a thriving Jewish community expressed shock that such horror visited their town.\n\nSome related scenes of wounded victims on the sidewalk, of families fleeing with their kids in terror and of one man who put his children inside a dumpster for safety.\n\nThis was “just inconceivable in a community like Highland Park,” Jeff Leon, an eye witness who at first thought the pops of the rifle were July Fourth fireworks, told CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Like a battle zone': Witness describes scary moment shots rang out at Highland Park parade 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents Illinois’ 10th Congressional District, expressed similar disbelief. “No one thinks that this could happen in our community, but that is true across the country,” he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. And Dr. Brigham Temple, medical director of emergency preparedness for NorthShore University HealthSystem, told reporters: “It is a little surreal to have to take care of an event such as this.”\n\nA common sentiment of people caught up in such mass shootings is disbelief that their community, which they had considered safe, has been hit. But in a nation awash in guns, nowhere is immune. Even at July Fourth celebrations across the country that were perfectly safe, how many of the attendees didn’t have a flash of concern about their security? Having to think about the possibility of mass shooting – at a school or a movie theater or a place of worship – has now become part of life since it’s happened so often. It’s another weight of anxiety and stress on a national psyche strained by the Covid-19 pandemic, soaring inflation and vicious political divides that contributed to a pessimistic mood this July Fourth.\n\nGun violence is hardly new in American society. But the proliferation of deadly weapons is now forcing people everywhere in the United States to face worries long endured by those familiar with the horrific toll of firearms in cities.\n\nIt’s gotten nowhere near as much coverage. But the high-profile shootings in Uvalde and Highland Park, for instance, are taking place against a backdrop of incessant killings elsewhere.\n\nThere have been at least the 311 mass shooting in the United States so far this year, including 14 in just the first four days of this month, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nAnd it’s only July.\n\nThe politics of gun control\n\nThe suspect, Robert E. Crimo III, has been taken into custody near Lake Forest, Illinois, authorities said during a brief news conference Monday night after an hours-long manhunt.\n\nSgt. Chris Covelli, of the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, said earlier in the day that the firearm used in shooting was a “high powered rifle” but declined to give further details. If that is borne out, it would just be the latest occasion when a weapon with the capacity to quickly fire multiple rounds with deadly effect has been used in a mass shooting.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police name person of interest in July 4 parade shooting 01:22 - Source: CNN\n\nPresident Joe Biden and firearms safety advocates have called for a reinstatement of a nationwide assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. There is no chance, however, that such a measure could get through Republican opposition in the US Senate because of filibuster rules that require a 60-vote majority for major legislation. It’s unlikely Democrats with their wafer-thin majority could pass it on their own, and they lack the votes needed to change the filibuster rules.\n\nThe Highland Park mass shooting is the first to come to national attention since the passage of the first major gun safety legislation in Congress in a generation. It is far too early to know whether that measure – which poured new money into mental health resources and potentially slowed the pace at which people under 21 can get guns – could have prevented this tragedy or whether the incident will expose its limited scope. Biden and families of the victims of recent gun massacres had pleaded with Congress to do far more, but Republican opposition makes it all but impossible to pass meaningful overhauls of firearm laws, including expanded background checks.\n\nThe July Fourth holiday meant that there was little immediate political reaction to Monday’s mass killing from Republicans, even as Democrats such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Pritzker demanded more gun restrictions.\n\nThe rituals of America’s incessant mass shootings will likely now see Republicans try to point to other factors besides the availability of guns. It’s true that most gun owners in America are law-abiding. But logic suggests that America’s massive proliferation of guns compared with other nations and the high incidence of mass killings are linked. And it’s clear that more people having guns – what the National Rifle Association would call “good guys with guns” – isn’t stopping all of these killings.\n\nSecond Amendment activists insist that the right to own high-powered weapons is within every American’s rights to bear arms. And the conservative US Supreme Court majority is setting about loosening existing gun restrictions. All of which suggests that Monday’s shooting will result in no action that makes America safer. The heavy lift in passing even the limited gun safety legislation last month suggests that a gridlocked political system has already done as much as it can bear.\n\nYet each recent mass shooting poses the same questions, which are especially acute on a day that America celebrates its freedoms.\n\nWhy do the rights of those who insist they have the constitutional blessing to own such deadly weapons outweigh the right of others to life – especially since a majority of Americans support more comprehensive gun control? And why, for instance, should moms, dads, kids or grandparents have to so often run for their lives?\n\n“It can happen any place,” Miles Zaremski, who witnessed the shooting in Highland Park, told CNN on Monday afternoon. “I’ve been around many years on this planet and what I observed shook me to the core.”\n\n“If it can happen on July 4, in a peaceful law-abiding community that we have in Highland Park … it can happen any place.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/04/presidents-new-york-born/86232738/", "title": "NY State of Mind going presidential: A brief history", "text": "Richard Liebson\n\nrliebson@lohud.com\n\nAfter 12 consecutive U.S. presidents from somewhere else, this year the Empire State strikes back. Whether it's Queens native Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, who now hails from Chappaqua, the next occupant of the White House will undoubtedly bring some New York style, swagger, smarts and strangeness to the highest office in the land.\n\nTRUMP: In Briarcliff: 'I'm going to be America's champion'\n\nCLINTON: Hillary nomination 'a milestone'\n\nThere have been six commanders-in-chief who called New York home. Not all did big things or are even remembered. Some are considered giants, and others got their share of Bronx cheers. None, as you'll see, were boring.\n\n'Old Kinderhook'\n\nOK, let's start with the first American president. No, it wasn't George Washington. Washington may have been the father of our country, but he and all of the founding fathers were born in British colonies and considered themselves Englishmen. Technically, there was no United States of America until the Continental Congress said there was in the July 4, 1776 Declaration of Independence. So that makes Martin Van Buren, who was born in 1782 in New York State, the first U.S.-born president.\n\nVan Buren, a Democrat who served as the nation's eighth president from 1837 to 1841, was one of nine chief executives who never went to college. He quit school at age 14, but still managed to pass the bar and become a lawyer when he was 23. And while he and his presidency are largely overlooked and forgotten, Van Buren's legacy remains a constant in our lives even today. Van Buren frequently and affectionately referred to his upstate hometown as \"Old Kinderhook.\" His political cronies used the phrase as his nickname, and helped popularize the abbreviated version: \"OK.\"\n\nMemorable quote: \"As to the presidency, the two happiest days of my life were those of my entry upon the office and the day of my surrender of it.\"\n\nThe book-loving, firefighting, home improver\n\nWhen the Library of Congress caught fire on Dec. 24, 1851, President Millard Fillmore raced over and helped put it out. Fillmore, born in a log cabin in the Finger Lakes village of Summerhill, served as the 13th president from 1850 to 1853, completing the term of Zachary Taylor, who died after a year in office. A member of the Whig Party, Fillmore was the last president not to be a Democrat or Republican. Although he had little formal education, Fillmore loved reading and books. Soon after the Library of Congress fire, he signed a funding bill to replace all of the books lost in the blaze. To help improve his vocabulary, Fillmore carried a dictionary at all times. Despite his intellect, when Oxford University wanted to award him an honorary degree, Fillmore turned it down, saying he didn't have \"the literary or scientific attainment.\"\n\nFillmore installed the first library in the White House. He also had the mansion fitted with its first bathtub and kitchen stove. When the cook couldn't figure out how to work the stove, the president went to the U.S. Patent Office, read the patent and taught the kitchen staff how to use the new-fangled contraption.\n\nMemorable quote: \"May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.\"\n\nLiving large\n\nChester A. Arthur was born in Vermont, but grew up in various upstate New York villages before his family settled in Schenectady. As a young abolitionist lawyer, he represented Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Jennings Graham, a black woman, in a civil rights lawsuit that resulted in the desegregation of New York City street cars in 1855 — a century before Rosa Parks more famously refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nArthur, a Republican, served as 21st president from 1881 to 1885, assuming office when James Garfield died two months after being shot by an assassin. \"Elegant Arthur,\" as he was known, played the banjo, liked to socialize and had a taste for fashion and the good life. He changed his clothes frequently for different occasions and reportedly owned 80 pairs of pants. Upon moving into the Executive Mansion and not finding it to his taste, Arthur had 20 cartloads of furnishings hauled away and hired Louis Comfort Tiffany (yes, that Tiffany) to redecorate. Not exactly an early to bed, early to rise guy, President Arthur was known to take walks around Washington, D.C. as late as 2 or 3 a.m.\n\nMemorable quote: \"I may be President of the United States, but my private life is my own damn business.\"\n\nThe 'Buffalo Hangman' skipped a term\n\nThe man whose face graces the seldom-seen $1,000 bill is Grover Cleveland, the only president to serve non-consecutive terms. Born in New Jersey, the future 22nd and 24th president lived in western New York and was elected sheriff of Buffalo in 1870. Not one to leave all the dirty work to his underlings, Cleveland earned his \"Buffalo Hangman\" moniker by virtue of having personally pulled the gallows lever for at least two executions.\n\nCleveland was elected president in 1884, becoming the first Democrat to serve in the Oval Office after the Civil War. He dedicated the Statue of Liberty during his first term and had a reputation for answering the White House telephone himself. Despite a 27-year age difference, Cleveland became the only president to marry while in office, tying the knot with the prophetic Frances Folsom, who was 21 at the time. Cleveland lost his 1888 re-election bid to Benjamin Harrison. As Cleveland and his bride were moving out, the young First Lady told the White House staff to \"take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again.\"\n\nSure enough, in 1892, Cleveland defeated Harrison to recapture the presidency.\n\nMemorable quote: \"Sometimes I wake at night in the White House and rub my eyes and wonder if it is not all a dream.\"\n\nThe force of nature\n\nThe 26th president was the living embodiment of hyperactivity. There's a photograph of 6-year-old Theodore Roosevelt peering down from the second floor of his New York City home as Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession passes by. It may be the last time Roosevelt ever stood still. He was, at various times, a lawyer, cowboy, big game hunter, taxidermist, mountain climber, war hero, author of 38 books, New York City police commissioner, environmentalist and politician. A Republican, Roosevelt served from 1901 to 1909, taking office after the assassination of William McKinley. His smarts, charisma, confidence, drive, boundless energy, optimism and exuberance were the stuff of legend.\n\nIn 1903, Roosevelt's name was attached to a favorite children's toy, the \"Teddy Bear.\" Three years later, he became the first president to win the Nobel Prize. Roosevelt frequently cajoled cabinet members to join him in long, vigorous hikes, wrestling and boxing matches and \"refreshing\" nude swims in the icy Potomac River. After losing sight in one eye during a boxing match with a young Army officer, the president decided, at age 50, to retire from the sport and take up jujitsu. The first president to travel outside the U.S., Roosevelt visited Panama, where he was largely responsible for the building of the canal.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, he embarked on an African safari that supplied many of the plant and wildlife specimens still on display at the Smithsonian. In 1912, he survived being shot in the chest during an unsuccessful bid to return to the White House as a third party candidate. Roosevelt was 58 at the outbreak of World War I, and lobbied relentlessly to lead an infantry unit, but was turned down. All four of his sons fought in the war, and his youngest, Quentin, was shot down flying over Germany. Roosevelt remained active politically and physically until his death, in his sleep, in 1919.\n\nMemorable quote: \"It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.\"\n\nThe favorite son\n\nIn 1887, President Grover Cleveland told a five-year-old White House visitor, \"My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be president of the United States.\" Oh well. Our 32nd president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the country through the Great Depression and World War II, was so popular that he was elected four times and served from 1933 until his death in 1945, four months into his fourth term.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family and raised on their estate in Hyde Park, in Dutchess County. Some may be familiar with a photo showing him as a toddler, wearing a ruffled white dress and shoulder-length hair. That's how boys from rich families were dressed for portraits back then, until about age 5, when they also received their first haircuts. Stricken with polio when he was 39, Roosevelt was paralyzed from the waist down — a fact he hid from the public.\n\nA fifth cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt, FDR married another fifth cousin, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. His presidency was one of many firsts. A Democrat, Roosevelt was the first and will be the last to serve more than two presidenial terms — thanks to the limit set by the 22nd Amendment in 1951. He was the first president to have an airplane, the first to appoint a woman to his cabinet and the first to appear on television. Roosevelt was most likely the only president to have a horse tail hanging in his White House bedroom. The tail in question was once attached to \"Gloucester,\" a racehorse owned by his father. Despite his privileged background, Roosevelt had the common touch. His \"Fireside Chats\" on the radio endeared him to the nation. He liked playing poker, loved dogs and once served hot dogs to the King and Queen of England.\n\nMemorable quote: \"Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell 'em, 'Certainly I can!'

As July 4th nears, poll ...", "text": "The United States will blow out 247 birthday candles this year, but many Americans aren’t in a celebratory mood.\n\nPolls show there is little excitement about the 2024 presidential front-runners and there is a lingering alarm about U.S. institutions.\n\nIn all, 7 out of 10 Americans agree with the statement that American democracy is \"imperiled,\" according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll ahead of Independence Day.\n\nThe fallout from the Jan. 6 insurrection coupled with concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence and other barriers to the ballot box has many Americans biting their nails and asking whether the state of democracy can be improved as the country hurtles into another presidential election that promises to be even more divisive.\n\nWhat happens next will largely be decided by the results of the election and other down-ballot races. To get ready, more states are taking steps to expand the vote and protect poll workers in 2023 compared with states working to make it harder to vote, according to expert analysis. Legislators and other advocates say those shifts represent a vibrant and growing pro-democracy movement.\n\nWhy are Americans losing faith in democracy?\n\nIn the past two election cycles, the fundamentals of democracy have faced significant threats, fueled largely by persistent lies from former President Donald Trump and his allies about whether he truly lost the 2020 contest (he did, according to Republican and Democratic election leaders across the nation).\n\nThose denials ignited a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but also fueled a number of states to pursue more restrictive voting laws in the name of election security. In the months that followed, hundreds of election deniers were inspired to seek public office, and although many failed to win they remain a part of the national conversation.\n\nPro-democracy advocates point to those losses in the 2022 midterm election as a sign of how seriously voters take the health of the nation's democracy.\n\n\"In recent elections, the majority of the people have sent a clear message: they wholly reject anti-democratic election denialism and want their basic rights protected,” former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has spearheaded a Democratic-led initiative on redistricting, told USA TODAY.\n\n“They want a truly representative democracy and the rights that should come with that.\"\n\nVoting rights depend largely on 'where you live'\n\nAt least 13 states have enacted about 15 restrictive voting rights laws in total this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy group. Seven laws seek to curb access to mail voting, for instance, which was popular during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter the 2020 elections, 14 states passed 22 restrictive laws in 2021.\n\n\"Where we're heading in terms of our democracy and voting rights depends a lot on which state you're in and increasingly, where you live rather than everybody in America having the same experience,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Brennan Center's Voting Rights division.\n\nAt the same time, legislators in 15 states took steps this year toward expanding voting rights. Of those, 23 measures made ballot access safer and easier, such as automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for people upon their release from prison and imposing criminal penalties for intimidating poll workers, who saw a rise in threats.\n\nMinnesota, armed with a new Democratic \"trifecta\" in control of its state government, passed some of the most progressive voting laws in the country this year. It implemented automatic voter registration for residents once they turn 18, allowed pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and created a permanent absentee voter list that sends a ballot to residents who sign up.\n\n\"The violent insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, really shocked the conscience of many voters,\" Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman told USA TODAY. \"What we found on the campaign trail, both in anecdotal stories from door knocking and from the data we collected from polling, was that voters were really concerned about our democracy in light of those incidents.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are worried about future of American democracy\n\nThe health of U.S. democracy is something Americans agree about across the board, according to the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll. It shows 74% of Democrats agree that \"democracy is imperiled.\" About 75% of Republicans agree and 66% of independents.\n\n\"This question does not cut off on political party,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"In fact, it's a validation that all political factions, whether you're in the left, right or in the middle, feel that democracy is imperiled, and that's pretty powerful.\"\n\nLarry Skinner, 72, a retired financial analyst and longtime Republican supporter from Riverside, California, said he remembers when President Ronald Reagan \"worked well\" with Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill in the 1980s to get legislation passed in Congress. These days, Skinner, who has been married for 54 years and has three adult children and nine grandchildren. said there is \"no road to compromise\" between the political parties.\n\nSkinner would like to see less of politicians \"from both parties making statements that clearly are not accurate. That makes so sense to me.\"\n\nPatrice Jackson, 48, a public school teacher for 18 years and GOP supporter from Chester, Pennsylvania, also said she wants less contentiousness in Washington.\n\n\"Can we please try to be more kind to one another, regardless of your party affiliation?\" Jackson asks. \"Can we reprioritize and focus on what the important issues are?\"\n\nFirst-term New Hampshire State Rep. Angie Brennan is a Democrat in a state that has a high concentration of registered independent voters. Strengthening the nation's democracy heavily depends on voter participation by removing barriers to the ballot box and proposing measures such as no-excuse absentee voting to ensure their constitutional rights, Brennan said.\n\n\"We all have a responsibility to fight for the future of our democracy,\" she said. \"It’s going to take all of us coming together to increase access and opportunities to vote. The future of our democracy depends on hope, humanity, and hard work, and I’m not giving up on any of that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/04/us/4th-of-july-parade-shooting-witnesses/index.html", "title": "4th of July parade shooting witnesses describe terror at the scene ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nZoe Pawelczak’s dad thought the repetitive pops ringing out at Highland Park’s Fourth of July parade Monday morning were part of the show, she says.

People behind them started running, too.\n\n“And I looked back … and then it was just this sea of panic, and people just falling and falling,” she recalled.\n\nPawelczak was one of the witnesses telling stories of sheer terror mere hours after the shooting in the Chicago suburb. Authorities say someone opened fire from a roof as the parade passed nearby, killing at least six people and wounding about two dozen others. Police said Monday night they had arrested a suspect, Robert E. Crimo III.\n\nPawelczak, who’d just moved back from Arizona, said she went to the parade to bond with her father, as she used to attended the event as a child. After a band passed she heard a long round of shots – maybe 50 or more, she said.\n\nShe believes she saw at least one person shot dead, she told CNN, choking up. It was not immediately clear who that was.\n\nAfter she grabbed her father, they hid behind a dumpster for about an hour, before police ushered them and others into a sporting goods store, she said. She and her father were OK, but others in the store were injured.\n\nLaw enforcement officers investigate the scene after the shooting Monday.

And it was probably 30 of us just hiding in this little corner behind the dumpster.”\n\nPawelczak said that her father knew Crimo.\n\n“The kid’s dad is an amazing person and (I) can’t believe it was his son,” she said. “I’m very happy to know he’s in custody.

And I threw my body on top of theirs,” he said.\n\nTilken said they ran into the nearby store when he realized they were unprotected and in the line of fire.\n\n“We were just sitting ducks right there and one bullet could pass through all of our bodies,” he said.\n\nAround 20 people were sheltering in different areas of the basement, including two women who appeared to have minor injuries from bullet grazes, Tilken said.\n\n“My wife’s granddaughter, she was shaken but in the basement, she, you know, tapped into some inner resources and was trying to be helpful to people with young kids and helping keeping the kids entertained and actually helping the two woman that had some of the minor wounds,” Tilken said.\n\nHe said he went out of the store at one stage to try to see what was happening and saw a body “in a pool of blood,” about eight feet from where he was standing. “I realized … it’s just your random luck that I wasn’t shot.”\n\nPolice carrying assault weapons later entered the basement looking for the shooter, Tilken said, and then brought a doctor to assess those with injuries.\n\nA woman views the candles and flowers left for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on Tuesday, July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Illinois.

People began yelling, “shooter” and, “run,” and he and his family fled toward their car for safety.\n\n“People were hiding, kids were on the streets looking for their parents, just in a state of shock,” he said.\n\nAnother attendee, Miles Zaremski, who has lived in the area for about 37 years, first thought the gunshots were backfire from a parade vehicle, or fireworks.\n\nWhen it continued, he realized it was from a gun – and he saw people rushing away.\n\n“I saw blood on the sidewalk. I saw a bloodied body that looked deceased,” Zaremski told CNN. “It was sickening. It was just chaotic.”\n\nZaremski later said witnessing the scene “on the nation’s birthday…with people supposedly enjoying themselves,” had shaken him to the core.\n\n“If it can happen on July 4 in a peaceful, law-abiding community like we have in Highland Park,” he told CNN. “It can happen anyplace.”\n\nDebbie Glickman, 54, was dancing to music, she said, when “all of a sudden we saw people running away from the parade.”\n\n“One of my friends … just said, ‘Run, run, run – there’s a shooter, there’s a shooter!’” she recalled. Glickman ran, and said she did not see a gunman or anyone injured.\n\n“People were thinking that maybe it was just a firecracker that had gone off bad, but people were running, and … it just was absolute mass chaos,” she said. “It was absolutely the most terrifying thing that’s ever happened to me.”\n\n‘I’m surprised it took this long’\n\nLarry Bloom, a Highland Park resident of 15 years, told CNN he had cycled to the parade and was standing just to the right of a bandstand when he heard a “pop, pop, pop.”\n\n“Then it just opened-up. Just a rain of gunshots, just so quickly, for quite a while, at least it seemed,” Bloom said. “Then everybody just got up, turned and ran and tried to get behind something.”\n\nIt was early in the celebrations and there were a lot of people present, Bloom said: “Just imagine a full audience for a parade, it was that many people. It was hundreds of people just in that area – just all running in the same direction,” he said.\n\nThe shots felt like they were coming from across the street and aimed at the area of the crowd he was in, Bloom said, though it was hard to establish where the gunman was. “It was right on top of us,” he said. “From a rooftop wouldn’t be unimaginable.”\n\nWhen the gunshots stopped and it cleared out and the police moved in, most people left the area, Bloom said.\n\n“Over the years, considering the temperature of this country and some of the demographics of our town here, every year I’m surprised – and thankful – that it hasn’t happened yet. And after I got to a safe space and I was able to get a few seconds of breath, I really just thought, ‘Yup, see, it finally happened here, this is ours.’ It’s disappointing, but I’m surprised it took this long, which sounds awful,” Bloom said.\n\nJeff Leon, 57, told CNN the gunshots at the parade sounded like “firecrackers in a garbage can,” and it wasn’t until he saw police officers reacting that he knew anything had happened.\n\n“It sounded like a string of firecrackers that were let off inside of a metal garbage bin… at first that’s what I thought it was,” he said, adding he didn’t immediately react.\n\n“The police started reacting and I saw some people falling,” Leon said. That’s when he said he and everyone around him left all their belongings and began to run.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Adrienne Broaddus Eric Levenson Susannah Cullinane", "Jason Hanna", "Adrienne Broaddus", "Eric Levenson", "Susannah Cullinane"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

Born on December 31, 1977, he is considered 44 by international age; 45 by calendar year age; and 46 by Korean age.\n\nIf this sounds confusing, it is, with daily life in the country often switching between the hodgepodge of different systems.\n\nMost people use Korean age, which has its roots in China, in everyday life and social scenarios, while international age is more often used for legal and official matters – for instance, when dealing with civil laws.\n\nHowever, some laws – including those surrounding the legal ages for drinking, smoking, and military conscription – use calendar year age.\n\nThe law passed Thursday will standardize the use of international age across all “judicial and administrative areas,” according to the parliament website and documents related to the bill.\n\n“The state and local governments shall encourage citizens to use their ‘international age’ and conduct necessary promotion for that,” it says.\n\nThe decision is the result of years of campaigning by lawmakers fed up with the multiple systems.\n\n“The revision is aimed at reducing unnecessary socio-economic costs because legal and social disputes as well as confusion persist due to the different ways of calculating age,” Yoo Sang-bum of the ruling People Power Party told parliament, according to Reuters.\n\nAnother bill introduced by lawmaker Hwang Ju-hong in 2019 argued that apart from sowing confusion, the three methods also caused conflict by “fostering a culture of hierarchy based on age and avoiding certain months for childbirth.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Yoonjung Seo", "Jessie Yeung", "Yoonjung Seo"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/04/12/south-korea-tradition-tacks-another-year-babies-age-jan-1/3445419002/", "title": "South Korean babies born Dec. 31 become 2-year-olds on Jan. 1 ...", "text": "Kim Chandler\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDAEJEON, South Korea – Just two hours after Lee Dong Kil’s daughter was born on New Year’s Eve, the clock struck midnight, 2019 was ushered in, and the infant became 2-years-old. She wasn’t alone, though it happened for her quicker than most: Every baby born in South Korea last year became 2 on Jan. 1.\n\nAccording to one of the world’s most unusual age-calculating systems, South Korean babies become 1 on the day of their birth and then get an additional year tacked on when the calendar hits Jan. 1. A lawmaker is working now to overturn the centuries-old tradition amid complaints that it’s an anachronistic, time-wasting custom that drags down an otherwise ultramodern country.\n\nFor parents whose babies are born in December, it can be especially painful. One hour after his daughter’s birth in the central city of Daejeon at 10 p.m. on Dec. 31 of last year, Lee posted the news on social media. His friends immediately showered him with congratulatory messages.\n\n“An hour later, when the New Year began, they phoned me again to say congratulations for my baby becoming 2-years-old,” said Lee, who is 32 internationally but 34 in South Korea. “I thought, ‘Ah, right. She’s now 2 years old, though it’s been only two hours since she was born. What the heck!’”\n\nSouth Korea:President Moon seeks deal, maybe a new summit, for Trump and Kim Jong Un\n\nTrump-North Korea:President predicts 'tremendous things' with NK, but over time\n\nThe origins of this age reckoning system aren’t clear. Being 1 upon birth may be linked to the time babies spend in their mothers’ wombs or to an ancient Asian numerical system that didn’t have the concept of zero.\n\nBecoming a year older on Jan. 1? That’s even harder to explain.\n\nIt could be that ancient Koreans cared a lot about the year in which they were born in the Chinese 60-year cycle, but, without regular calendars, didn’t care much about the specific day they were born; so they mostly ignored the day of their birth and instead marked another year of age on the day of the Lunar New Year, according to senior curator Jung Yonhak at the National Folk Museum of Korea.\n\nThis may have then shifted to the solar New Year on Jan. 1 as the South began embracing the Western calendar. North Korea uses the Western age calculating system, but they have a twist: they follow their own calendar that’s based on the birth of national founder and president-for-life Kim Il Sung.\n\nThe year of your birth is still incredibly important in South Korea, and lumps those linked children together for life.\n\nOther Asian countries, including Japan and Vietnam, abandoned the Chinese-style age system amid an influx of Western culture. Officially, South Korea has used Western-style calculations since the early 1960s. But its citizens still embrace the old-fashioned system in their daily lives because the government has done little to get people to change over to the Western style.\n\nMost South Koreans are simply accustomed to living with two ages.\n\n2019 babies:Celebrities who have welcomed new babies this year\n\nDo 'the right thing':People who can't get vaccinated during a measles outbreak rely on the healthy\n\nPeople don’t hold massive joint birthday parties on New Year’s Day; they just celebrate their birthday on the days they were born. Young people consider themselves another year old on solar New Year’s Day (Jan. 1) while older people often use the Lunar New Year’s Day. Many family restaurants don’t charge babies if they are 36-months-old or younger, so parents often calculate their babies’ ages under the Western method when they’re dining out.\n\nSome South Koreans still worry that the practice makes their nation look odd on the international stage. Some feel confusion when meeting with foreigners. Associated Press journalists in Seoul must ask Koreans what year and month they were born to calculate their Western age for news stories.\n\nThere are also some who say the concept of “Korean age” encourages a fixation on age-based social standing in this seniority-based country. In South Korea, those born in the same year often treat each other as equals, while people must use honorific titles to address those born earlier, rather than directly using their names.\n\nAhn Chang-gun, from the southeastern city of Gimhae, said he felt “empty” when his first child became 2 on Jan. 1, 2013, about two weeks after his wife delivered him after eight years of marriage. “He was this precious baby that we finally had, but I felt that all of a sudden two years had just gone by and yet I hadn’t done anything for my baby,” said Ahn.\n\nParents whose babies are born in December often worry about their kids falling behind other children born earlier in the same year, though worries gradually disappear as their children age.\n\nWhen Seo Hyo Sun from Buchon, just west of Seoul, was taken to the hospital to get a cesarean section on Dec. 29, she couldn’t stop weeping because her baby’s due date was supposed to be Jan. 7.\n\n“Tears kept flowing. … My doctor told me the baby wanted to come out today so let’s just celebrate,” said Seo, 31 in international age. “When I awoke from my anesthesia, I felt really grateful … because my baby was born healthy. That was enough.”\n\nIn January, lawmaker Hwang Ju-hong tabled a bill aimed at requiring the government to put international ages in official documents and encouraging general citizens to go with their international ages in everyday life. It’s the first legislative attempt to abolish “Korean age.”\n\nBaby dietary guidelines:First-ever dietary guidelines coming for babies, given 'life sentence' if obese by age 5\n\nMeasles:Is my child safe from the measles? Everything parents should know\n\n“It is aimed at resolving confusion and inefficiency caused by the mixed use of age-counting systems,” Hwang said in the proposed legislation.\n\nHwang’s office said a parliamentary committee discussion and a public hearing on the issue are expected in coming months.\n\nSurveys in recent years showed more South Koreans supported international age though it wasn’t clear how seriously they wanted a change.\n\n“If we use international age, things could get more complicated because it’s a society that cares so much about which year you were born,” said Lim KyoungJae, 46, head of the Seoul-based Miko Travel agency. “We should also definitely count the time of a baby being conceived and growing in its mother’s womb.”\n\nLim’s employee Choi Min Kyung, who is 26 internationally and 28 in South Korea, disagreed.\n\n“It’s good to be two years younger … (especially) when you meet men” on blind dates, Choi said with a laugh. “There is a big difference between 26 and 28.”\n\nAssociated Press journalist Chang Yong Jun contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/trevor-reed-russia/index.html", "title": "Trevor Reed: American released from Russia in prisoner swap ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAmerican Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former Marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019, is back in the United States, his mother Paula Reed tweeted early Thursday.\n\nReed was released in a prisoner swap Wednesday.\n\n“It’s been (a) very exciting day for the Reed family,” Paula Reed tweeted. “Trevor is back in the USA.”\n\nThe release ended a nearly three-year ordeal for Reed, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the “life and health” of Russian police officers in an altercation. Reed and his family have denied the charges against him.\n\nIn her tweet, Paula Reed also advocated for the release of Paul Whelan, a US citizen and former Marine who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n\nReed’s release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.\n\nHis release came after months of effort by the US government, officials said, and was particularly urgent given concerns about Reed’s health. It was ultimately secured through a prisoner swap for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko.\n\nThe exchange took place in Turkey on Wednesday, Trevor’s parents, Paula and Joey Reed, previously told CNN.\n\nThe couple, who spoke to their son by phone shortly after the prisoner exchange, said he had been subdued. “The first phone call we got, he did not sound like himself,” Paula Reed said Wednesday evening at a news conference outside their home in Granbury, Texas.\n\nShe said his spirits seemed better by the time they received a second call from him later in the day: “He still looks terrible, but he sounded better. He sounded more like himself.”\n\nTrevor Reed, who was detained in Russia for nearly three years, saw Yaroshenko on the tarmac during the prisoner swap but did not say anything to him, according to his father.\n\n“Trevor quickly told us that they – the American plane pulled up next to the Russian plane, and they walked both prisoners across at the same time like you see in the movies,” Joey Reed said earlier on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nThe Reeds said they had also spoken to President Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed their gratitude.\n\n“I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence,” Biden said in a statement. “And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.”\n\nAsked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday whether he had been surprised by Reed’s release given Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Biden said: “I did it.” The President, pressed on how, continued, “I raised it,” adding, “Three months ago.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told Collins earlier Wednesday that the President waited to notify the Reed family of their son’s freedom due to “not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk – even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.”\n\nPressed on whether Russia was able to extract any other conditions from the US aside from a one-to-one prisoner swap, Psaki told CNN, “There were no other conditions that I’m aware of,” later adding, “This was about one issue and topic and I don’t think we should read into it further.”\n\n‘Months and months’ of negotiations\n\nReed’s release was the result of “months and months of hard careful work across the US government” on the matter, a senior administration official said, noting that “the conversations on this particular issue have accelerated recently to get us to this point.”\n\nOne driving factor was concern for Reed’s health. His family has expressed worry about his likely exposure to tuberculosis as well as lingering effects from having Covid-19.\n\nThe official, speaking to reporters on a background call Wednesday, said that “ultimately, those negotiations led the President to have to make a very hard decision with a decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine.”\n\nYaroshenko is a Russian pilot who had been detained in Liberia by undercover US Drug Enforcement Agency agents on May 28, 2010, and brought to the US, according to Russian state news agency TASS. He was convicted of drug smuggling in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, which he had been serving at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. He has denied the charges against him.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry had previously raised the possibility that Yaroshenko could be returned “in exchange for any American national” held in Russia.\n\nThe official did not provide details about how or why Yaroshenko was chosen for the swap, but noted that he had served the majority of his US sentence and is now in Russian custody.\n\n“This is a tough call for a President. President Biden made it to bring home an American whose health was a source of an intense concern, and to deliver on his commitment to resolve these hard cases and reunite Americans with their loved ones,” the official said.\n\nPaula Reed spoke Wednesday with CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”\n\n“I’m going to try not to cry, because he doesn’t want me to cry,” Reed’s mother, Paula, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” Wednesday. “Obviously, I’m going to cry a little bit, give him a big hug, and just, you know, give him hugs, and it will be the four of us together again (for the first time) in a few years, so it’s going to be great.”\n\nReed’s father previously told CNN he believed it was likely Reed was suffering from tuberculosis, that he was coughing up blood and also had a broken rib. He said Reed went to a prison hospital but did not receive treatment and was then sent back to solitary confinement.\n\nAs Reed started a second hunger strike in protest of his treatment by Russian authorities, Reed’s parents went to protest outside of the White House in the hopes of securing a meeting with the President.\n\nThe Reeds ultimately did meet with the President at the White House for about a half hour last month.\n\n2 other Americans still detained in Russia\n\nWednesday’s release also brought renewed attention to the case of Whelan. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.\n\nLast June, he told CNN of the grim conditions of the remote labor camp where he works in a clothing factory he called a “sweatshop” and said obtaining medical care is “very difficult.”\n\nIn his statement welcoming Reed’s release, Biden said his administration “won’t stop” until Whelan is home.\n\nThe Whelan family expressed happiness at Reed’s release but said it was a day of “varied emotions” and questions for them.\n\n“Unfortunately, time is not on Paul’s side. Our parents are literally not getting any younger. Our hope remains that Paul will be home so they may see him once more. But each day that hope dims,” his brother David Whelan said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, US basketball star Brittney Griner remains detained in Russia after she was arrested in February on allegations of drug smuggling. A Moscow court recently extended her detention until May 19, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nWhile her legal team has had access to her and was able to see her several times a week throughout her detention, a US official from the US embassy in Moscow was finally granted consular access to Griner in late March, and said they found her to be in “good condition.”\n\nNed Price, a State Department spokesman, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday that the cases remain top priorities for the US.\n\nPsaki echoed Price’s sentiment, saying Wednesday that the White House will “continue to do everything they can” to secure the release of Whelan, Griner and other Americans still detained in Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Radina Gigova Anna Chernova", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Radina Gigova", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nTeacher shortage:Amid crippling teacher shortages, some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v.

It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep.

Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections. Biden also congratulated her successor, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black American to be House minority leader.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat are burn pits?:Why were burn pits used? Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh is designated survivor for 2023 State of the Union\n\nSecretary of Labor Marty Walsh is the designated survivor for this year's State of the Union address.\n\nEvery year, a top government official is chosen as the “designated survivor” as a way to maintain the presidential line of succession in case of a catastrophic event where multiple officials in the line are unable to assume office.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMarty Walsh:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBono is at the State of the Union\n\nBono, the Irish lead singer of U2, is attending the State of the Union as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBono is a longtime social justice advocate who co-founded the nonprofit ONE Campaign to address poverty and preventable diseases and Prouct RED to address HIV and AIDS in Africa.\n\nHe’s sitting next to Paul Pelosi, husband of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\n2 Californians will sit behind Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may not share a political party. But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived ahead of him along with the majority of his Cabinet.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nPaul Pelosi arrives at State of the Union\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived at the State of the Union about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThis marks his first visit to a joint session of Congress since a video release of a brutal October attack that left him with head and hand injuries requiring surgery.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLawmakers arrive for State of the Union\n\nIf handshakes across the aisle are any reliable indication, there was a hint of bipartisanship in the air as lawmakers arrived for President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union before a divided Congress.\n\nThere was also the smell of cigars in the House gallery hallways on the third floor, a sign of the changing guard and new House rules.\n\nSeveral guests and congresswomen were wearing white, as a nod to the suffragettes. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/24/covid-19-texas-official-suggests-elderly-willing-die-economy/2905990001/", "title": "COVID-19: Texas official suggests elderly willing to die for economy", "text": "The lieutenant governor of Texas argued in an interview on Fox News Monday night that the United States should go back to work, saying grandparents like him don’t want to sacrifice the country’s economy during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nRepublican Lt.

In it, a costumed actor taught young children life lessons, problem-solving skills and how to be their most \"super-dee-duper\" selves.\n\nThe new Barney, set for release next year, encompasses TV, film and more and will be followed by a Barney product line in 2025.\n\nThe series will introduce new audiences to the world of Barney through music-filled adventures centered on love, community and encouragement.\n\nBarney's reboot\n\nBarney was around for nearly 20 years, then basically disappeared.\n\nSo why do some fads comeback and others die?\n\nCold cash, Bergman suggested.\n\n\"What's behind all reboots is a sense of nostalgia....the search for more money,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's always somebody has thought this was something I remembered in my childhood that was really good. Maybe they're looking at the programs that are out there today and they're seeing that they're maybe too complicated, or that they're seeing a need for something that's that level.\"\n\nResearchers still haven't figured it exactly what mechanism catches people's attention years later but, Bergman said, psychologists, neurologists, and neuroscientists have all been working on the answer.\n\n\"The people that were the target age group for Barney are getting into the decision-making groups,\" Bergman said. \"They're the ones that are in their 30s and 40s now. And they're the ones out there making the decisions, like, 'Hey, I liked this. Why wouldn't we want to try to make this happen again?'\"\n\nWhat happened with Don Lemon?:Don Lemon won't appear on CNN show after Nikki Haley 'prime' remarks\n\nHopefully, Barney's comeback isn't all for money, Berman said\n\n\"We can't assume that it was strictly the trying to only make money. Otherwise, they could have gone with something new,\" she said. \"So I think it was more that they knew that this was something that was so popular that they wanted to make sure that this generation had a chance to enjoy it... I hope that not everything in children's programming is strictly for the dollars.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in? Study looks at quality of life across the U.S.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The company is letting fans vote until Feb. 5 for the one they want to keep via the Monopoly Facebook page. The one with the lowest total goes directly — and permanently — to jail.\n\nFans also can vote for the replacement token: toy robot, helicopter, cat, guitar or diamond ring.\n\nA limited-run \"Golden Token\" Monopoly ($17.99) arrives in Target stores exclusively in mid-February, and it will be the last edition to have all of the classic tokens and the only set to have all five of the potential new pieces as well. The first Monopoly game to reflect the new token lineup will be released in late summer.\n\n\"There's a love affair with the token that each player has settled on over time. It's very seldom that you see a player not care about what token represents them on the game board,\" says Philip Orbanes, a Monopoly expert who's written three books on the game, including Monopoly, Money, and You (due in April).\n\nMonopoly emerged during the Depression, with numerous parties claiming to have contributed key elements to the game that was finally patented by Charles Darrow and sold to Parker Brothers. More than 275 million copies have been produced since the first edition in 1935. (Current owner Hasbro does not provide yearly sales figures.)\n\nSix of the current pieces were in that first set; the Scottie dog and wheelbarrow came along in the early 1950s. In the late 1990s, fans voted for a money bag that was added as a bonus. Soon after, the cannon and horse tokens were removed, shrinking the token total to eight from 10.\n\nBoard-game sales generally have slowed because of the recent weak economy, says Gerrick Johnson, toy analyst for BMO Capital Markets. \"The best time for board games is when you go into a recession, not when you pull out of it.\" He notes that the genre also has been threatened by smartphone and tablet games and by a lack of innovation.\n\n\"Newness always helps, and there has not been a lot of newness,\" Johnson says. But Monopoly is a classic, elegant game, \"and it will be around for another 100 years.\"\n\nThe new tokens are a reflection of Hasbro's desire to freshen the brand, says Jonathan Berkowitz, vice president of marketing for Hasbro Gaming. The company began with about 100 ideas for tokens and whittled the number to five by paying attention to the conversations its 10 million Facebook fans were having about their favorite pieces.\n\nAs a child, Berkowitz says, \"you remember grabbing that token and that being your icon that represents you in the game. That passes down from generation to generation. I see it with my kids today. I'm the race car, and they can't be the race car. They can get their own.\"\n\nOddsmaker R.J. Bell of Pregame.com says the wheelbarrow has the best odds, 2-1, of being ousted because of \"unstable board play\" and it being \"even less attractive to aspiring tycoons in today's wired world.\" That's followed by the iron at 5-1 (\"Who wants to iron in 2013?\"); thimble, 6-1; battleship, 7-1; shoe, 8-1; and hat, 20-1. The two he thinks are pretty safe are the Scottie dog at 25-1 (\"No one chooses to retire a dog\") and the race car, 30-1 (\"Only if they want half as many kids to play\").\n\nPlayers can get very passionate about their chosen token — that's why, in the official game rules, players who want the same piece have to roll dice to see which one gets it, says Orbanes, who acts as a judge for the U.S. national and world Monopoly championships. \"We don't want fisticuffs.\"\n\nHe picked the race car as an 8-year-old first playing the game in 1956. And while the helicopter and toy robot have a similar appeal to kids, Orbanes has a hunch the cat will have a strong showing.\n\n\"Cat lovers outnumber dog lovers,\" he says. \"Knowing how popular the Scottie is, I just assume there have to be far more people out there who are cat lovers who would love to see their icon in the game.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/11/04/arizona-iconic-businesses-closed/18468521/", "title": "Iconic Arizona businesses that are closed", "text": "The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nEditor's note: This story originally published in November 2014. If we've missed any Valley iconic businesses that have closed, add them in the comments section of the story.\n\nMany Phoenix-area restaurants, stores and other iconic businesses have come and gone in the area's history. Whether they had to shut down due to circumstance, management issues, skyrocketing prices or if they just couldn't keep up with the changing times, some of these businesses left a mark in the Valley. Here's a look at a few of the most iconic metro Phoenix businesses that have closed down.\n\nTom's Tavern\n\nJust shy of its 90th birthday, Tom’s Tavern in downtown Phoenix closed in 2017.\n\nThe iconic restaurant, a favorite of Arizona’s movers and shakers, opened in 1929.\n\nJim Gallen, the current chef-owner, released a statement via The Knight Agency, its Scottsdale-based PR firm:\n\n\"After careful consideration, Tom’s Tavern was forced to close on May 5. Owner and Chef Jim Gallen expressed great disappointment with the closure and would like to thank the loyal customers who have been with Tom’s for the last 87 years. Tom’s Tavern has a rich history in Phoenix, and has enjoyed serving many of our city’s finest. At this time, no plans have been made for the location at 2 N. Central Ave. Chef Gallen will continue cooking in the Valley and updates on his career will be announced soon.\"\n\nLegend City\n\nThe memories of this amusement park are better than the reality. Legend City changed hands four times during its 20-year lifetime. Each new owner would subtly change the park’s operations, evolving it further away from it's original Western-theme vision and more into a permanent carnival.\n\nThe original owner, Louis Crandall was inspired by Disneyland and the sudden boom of amusement parks across the country. The economic reality was it was too hot for an amusement park during Phoenix summers and winter evenings didn’t generate enough business.\n\nLegend City closed for the final time in September 1983. The park was leveled, and the grounds now hold office buildings for a public utility.Since then, there has been no amusement park like it in the area.\n\nVideo Paradise\n\nVideo Paradise in Chandler is from a bygone era, when video stores were a hot weekend stop for people of all ages and the wait for a new release created some buzz.\n\nAfter 25 years operating as a locally owned, independent store that hung on long after national chains Blockbuster and Hollywood Video closed stores across the country, the owner, Marshall Hawkins, said a \"perfect storm'' of factors led to the closure in January 2016. New in-home streaming such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, along with the proliferation of Red Box rental kiosks were one factor. Another was a change in terms of his lease at the shopping center where the store is located.\n\nHawkins, who had owned the store for its last 10 years in business, credited a loyal customer base for helping keep the store in business for a quarter of a century.\n\nEd Debevic's\n\nEd Debevic's was another family favorite, near 20th Street and Highland Avenue. Sassy waitresses served burgers and meatloaf at the retro-style diner through the '80s and '90s. The jukebox, photos and snarky neon signs went to auction when the diner closed in the early 2000s.\n\nFarrell's Ice Cream Parlour\n\nRobert Farrell opened the first of these old-fashioned ice-cream parlors in Portland, Ore., in 1963.\n\nThe family-friendly franchise came to the Valley in 1968, brought by Robert Garland, a World War II veteran who founded the Garland Advertising Agency, known for creating the branding for Del Webb's Sun City.\n\nGarland was credited with coining the line, \"Farrell's features fabulous food and fantastic fountain fantasies for frolicking, fun-filled, festive families.\"\n\nThe ice-cream shop was a popular party destination, thanks to novelties such as the Zoo, a 10-pound ice-cream sundae that vest-wearing servers wheeled to your table while making oinking noises and blaring sirens.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1990 — from the presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson to George H.W. Bush — Garland operated five Farrell's locations around Arizona. He closed shop around 1990, when the national chain, which had passed hands among several investment groups, foundered. Garland died in 2003.\n\nChocolates by Bernard Callebaut\n\nMaster chocolatier Bernard Callebaut first brought his exquisite confections to Arizona in 1996, when he opened Chocolaterie Bernard C in Scottsdale's Hilton Village.\n\nCallebaut's Belgian family had been in the chocolate business since 1911. When the business was sold in 1980, he moved to Alberta, Canada, and started his company.\n\nThe candies — more than 48 varieties — were made in Callebaut's factory in Canada using chocolate imported from Belgium, walnuts from France, and hazelnuts and almonds from Italy.\n\nThey had no artificial preservatives, vegetable oils or animal fats, and the whipping creams and butter were so fresh that the chocolates came with two-week expiration dates.\n\nThe stores, including one in Chandler and Phoenix, sold champagne truffles, boxed collections and seasonal specials such as chocolate yule logs, the traditional French chocolate-and-cream confection.\n\nIn a 2000 story about the best chocolate for Valentine's Day, Seftel wrote, \"In this town, if you want the best, it means a trip to Chocolates by Bernard Callebaut.\"\n\nThe Chandler store closed in 2004, and the rest of the chocolates began to disappear from Arizona, and most of the country, about four years later. The good news? The company is still around and you can buy the chocolate to be shipped to your home.\n\nBaker Nursery\n\nBaker Nursery was open for about 46 years until it finally closed down its doors in late 2014.During its time in business, employees helped landscape countless Phoenix-area homes, making the valley greener and full of life with yards and gardens of hibiscus and citrus trees.\n\nThe founder, Jim Baker, bought the location at 40th Street and Osborn Road in 1968, competing with large mega-stores like Walmart and Home Depot. In 2006, he signed the company over to three of his six daughters.\n\nA-1 Beer\n\nThere was a time when every city had its own breweries, and A-1 was the major player in Phoenix. It was later bought by a larger national brewery and the quality slipped a bit. If you remembered the brand from the 50s, when it was the “Western way to say welcome,” you thought of a crisp pilsner. Those who remember the canned beer from the 70s, have less fond memories.\n\nHarkins Camelview 5\n\nAfter a 42-year run as one of the Valley's preeminent movie theaters, Harkins Camelview 5 in Scottsdale closed in December 2015, replaced by a new 14-screen cinema next door at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. Harkins announced plans in 2013 to close Camelview, which long ago carved a niche in the Phoenix area as a destination for independent, foreign and artistic films.\n\nDowntown Deli\n\nA longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.\n\nMy Florist Café\n\nThis bakery, sandwich shop and wine bar was one of the first of the new wave of restaurants in the central Phoenix area when it opened in 1996. It offered a pricey, but delicious, peanut butter sandwich and offered a white wine with which to pair it. The piano performances by Nicole Pesce would delight crowds.\n\nBack in its 1990s heyday, My Florist Café attracted a cool crowd of bohemians and suits, folks who had almost no downtown Phoenix-area hangout alternatives. Here you could get decent grub and big-city vibes to go with it.\n\nIt closed suddenly in 2010. More eateries had filed into downtown by then. The iconic sign was left over from when the building did house a florist beginning in 1947. Below it now is a chain hamburger restaurant.\n\n12 Valley restaurants that stand the test of time\n\nKarsh's Bakery\n\nThis venerable kosher bakery, known for its handmade challah and rye breads, Kaiser rolls and Jewish pastries, fell victim to the times. It could not compete with high volume bakeries and increasing rents. It was one of the last old-school bakeries, where bakers made pastries, bagels and breads by hand each day.\n\nKarsh's Bakery closed in March 2014, ending nearly 50 years in business. On its last day, there were lines around the block with customers who started their wait before doors opened at 7 a.m. Owners said at the time that they hoped to find a smaller, more affordable location and re-open.\n\nCine Capri\n\nThis single screen theater was still viable. But the real estate it was on was eyed for redevelopment. Responding to an outcry from the community, developers tried to incorporate a Cine Capri-like theater into plans for high-rise office buildings. But negotiations soured. There was talk of putting the fate of the corner on the city ballot. The land owners announced plans to demolish the theater, effectively ending the arguments. Harkins Theaters has replicated the large screen curtained experience in two multiplex locations.\n\nBlakely's\n\nBlakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.\n\nScottsdale 6 Drive-in\n\nThis drive-in was demolished in 2014, years after it shut down. It was the latest in a string of drive-in movie theatres to close, the result of changing habits and tastes among movie-goers. Scottsdale 6 closed its doors in 2011. The Phoenix area used to be dotted with the outdoor screens. A partial list of names: Big Sky, Pioneer, Nu View and the Thunderbird.\n\nFollowing national trends , Arizona has lost almost 50 drive-ins in the past half-century. The Apache Drive-in, in Globe, closed in 2013, leaving only one drive-in theater still existing in the state: The WestWind Glendale 9 on 55th Avenue, south of Bethany Home Road.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille\n\nA popular taco shop that operated in downtown Chandler for 30 years closed in December 2015 after being acquired by a firm that plans to bring a new residential and retail development to the site.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille's longtime owner, William \"Guedo'' Samora III, confirmed the property had been acquired by COR Arizona Avenue Company LLC. The developer has been working for several years to bring the new mixed-use development to the corner, which is mostly vacant and includes a parcel of city-owned property that Chandler officials have sought to have developed.\n\nCookiez on Mill\n\nThis family-owned treat shop opened on Mill Avenue at Fifth Street in Tempe in 2003. Arizona State University students came in after class, football games or date nights to make their own ice-cream sandwiches, assembled with from-scratch cookies and more than 20 ice-cream flavors.\n\nChoices of cookies included peanut butter, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip, and were used to sandwich rocky road, cookies and cream, mint chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe shop, which also sold smoothies and other sweet treats, was housed in the historical Goodwin building, constructed in 1907 by Garfield A. Goodwin. The small space was added in 1912. Before housing Cookiez on Mill, it housed a Wells Fargo agency and the Tempe Daily News office.\n\nThe shop closed in November 2011.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale, an iconic steakhouse, closed on June 28, 2015. Generations of visitors, hankering for an Old West experience, set foot in the dusty wooden establishment, known for its 2-pound porterhouse steaks and of neckties hanging from the ceiling.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio started out in 1957 as a small store that sold beer and bait to fishermen traveling to nearby lakes. The original owner, wanting to increase sales, offered a simple steak dinner consisting of a 32-ounce Porterhouse steak cooked over mesquite wood. Its reputation grew as a place known for snipping off the necktie of anyone who dared enter its doors dressed so formal\n\nWhen the business closed, the owners expressed that they were looking for a new location to reopen some day.\n\nMonti's La Casa Vieja\n\nTempe's iconic Monti's La Casa Vieja, among the longest-lasting restaurants in Tempe and which was housed in the historic Hayden House on Mill Avenue, closed on Nov. 17, 2014, after nearly 60 years in business. The restaurant was opened in 1956 by the final owner's father, Leonard Monti, two years after he bought the Hayden House, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nMicheal Monti, the last owner of the restaurant, said of the historical site that even though the business is closing, \"the tradition and history aren't going away.\"\n\nThe downtown restaurant, which had been the gathering place for countless groups through the years and known Valley-wide for its steak, Roman bread and historic memorabilia, was shut down mainly for the cost of production and the high cost of beef.\n\nBig Apple\n\nBill Johnson's Big Apple, a 59-year icon at 3757 E. Van Buren St., closed May 24, 2015. The Phoenix restaurant was the last remaining in a chain that once had seven locations. The eatery was known for its Western decor and sawdust on the floor. The waitresses wore cowboy hats on their heads and toy six-shooters on their hips.\n\nHanny's\n\nBack when Phoenix residents went downtown to buy clothes, this was one of the department stores of choice. Shopping districts moved to malls and power centers in farther-flung areas. Hanny’s sturdy concrete structure stood vacant for years. The fire department would set it on fire for structure practice. But it has been reinvented and occupied as a wine bar and restaurant since 2008. Patrons can stand over the old elevator shaft. Names of clothing brands still decorate the walls.\n\nGreasewood Flat\n\nGeorge \"Doc\" Cavalliere opened Greasewood Flat, the iconic Western watering hole in north Scottsdale, in 1975. With its picnic tables, laid-back ambiance and rustic wares, the bunkhouse-turned-saloon east of Pinnacle Peak became a popular hangout for bikers and tourists, cowboys and families to kick up their boots and relax.\n\nAfter 40 years in business, Cavalliere’s passing in 2010 forced the family to sell the property to pay estate taxes and other expenses, and the saloon shut soon after. Taylor Morrison Homes bought the 43-acre property in 2013 and planned to build 80 houses there.\n\nHenkel AG (formally the Dial Corp.)\n\nHenkel AG, parent company of the Dial Corp., announced in October 2016 that it was shuttering its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices. The company said it would combine the operation with Sun Products Corp., which Henkel acquired in June 2016. Both companies were to move to a facility in Stamford, Conn.\n\nArizona lost roughly 375 jobs.\n\nHenkel acquired the Dial Corp., formally one of Arizona's largest corporations, in December 2004 for $2.9 billion.\n\nDial Corp.'s history in The Valley began when Greyhound, the company that owned Dial Corp., moved its headquarters to Phoenix in 1971.\n\nIn 1989, a new headquarters was built near downtown Phoenix. The building resembled a bar of soap and would be known as the Dial Tower.\n\nThe company moved to Scottsdale in 1997.\n\nHenkel is a Germany-based company that sells Purex and Persil laundry detergent, Dial soap and Right Guard deodorant, among other beauty products, detergents and adhesives.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/business/mcdonalds-adults-happy-meal/index.html", "title": "McDonald's is selling Happy Meals to adults — with a twist | CNN ...", "text": "1.

While this is higher than in 2017, it is still well below Hollywood’s best year. After peaking at 1.57 billion in 2002, ticket sales have steadily declined throughout the 21st century.\n\nDespite the declining attendance, Hollywood has never made more money – 2018 had a record-breaking box office haul of $11.8 billion. This is largely because movie tickets have never been more expensive. The national average cost of a movie ticket in 2018 was $9.11, marking the first time the average price has eclipsed $9.00. For most of the 1990s, tickets sold for an average of less than $5 apiece, and dating back to the 1960s, many Americans could go to the movies for less than a buck.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the National Association of Theatre Owners to determine the cost of a movie ticket the year you were born. The personal consumption expenditure price index was used to estimate the cost in the years for which there was no data. The year’s top grossing movie is the film released during that year with the highest domestic box office gross for its entire theatrical run, according to movie industry data site The Numbers.\n\nThe domestic box office has been dominated by superhero films in recent years. Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, The Avengers franchise, and various recent takes on the X-Men and DC universes have all earned billions. These films have maintained a grip on Hollywood for a decade, largely because they tend to be financial successes.\n\n$85,000 per year?:50 of the most expensive private high schools in America\n\n2018\n\n• Avg. ticket price: $9.11\n\n• Price adjusted for inflation: $9.11\n\n• Top-grossing movie of the year: Black Panther\n\n2017\n\n• Avg. ticket price: $8.97\n\n• Price adjusted for inflation: $9.16\n\n• Top-grossing movie of the year: Star Wars Ep.

Heaps of debt, bruising competition from Amazon and crushing pressures to reduce their physical footprint forced a wave of closures, some after companies filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe 2010s were cruel. Retailers shed thousands of stores in 2017, too, another record year of losses in the past decade.\n\nMichael Brown, a partner in the retail practice of consulting firm A.T. Kearney who has studied the future of shopping centers, said the closings represented a changing of the guard.\n\n“As we exit this decade, we’re really seeing the tidal wave of shift from physical to digital in many respects whether it’s physical to digital shopping or physical to digital products that are impacting what and how people are buying it,” Brown said.\n\nSears, Forever 21, Pier 1:These retailers are facing the fight for their lives in 2020\n\nStore closings:Who are the biggest victims of the retail apocalypse\n\nNow they're headed into a new decade saddled with fresh worries, from growing consumer debt to the trade dispute with China. A significant downturn isn't forecast for the industry, but chances are the pain won't let up anytime soon for some of America's struggling chains.\n\nThe brick-and-mortar downturn is expected to continue, according to a report released in April from UBS Securities. Investment bank analysts said 75,000 more stores would need to be shuttered by 2026 if e-commerce “penetration rises from 16% currently to 25%.”\n\n\"Amazon is the biggest threat to the retail industry and as such retailers are spending heavily to keep up with Amazon,\" John Haber, Spend Management Experts CEO, told USA TODAY, noting \"this strategy has proved deadly for those retailers that spent themselves straight into bankruptcy.\"\n\nBrown said there’s been a singling out of big box stores where there used to be two players in each sector.\n\n“We had Dick’s (Sporting Goods) and Sports Authority and lost Sports Authority. We had Borders and Barnes & Noble, we lost Borders,” Brown said. “We’ve seen a narrowing of the big box sector based on the strength of growing online but also on the growing strength of Walmart and Target being able to service those categories for the consumer.”\n\nA decade of store closings\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest stores that shuttered all or nearly all locations in the 2010s, many of which relaunched an online presence.\n\nBebe: 180 stores\n\nWomen's clothing chain Bebe was part of the 2017 string of closings and closed all of its stores that May. It staved off bankruptcy and remains an online store.\n\nBlockbuster: 1,700-plus stores\n\nThe saga of Blockbuster's demise was drawn out for several years. In 2010, the company filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Dish Network in 2011, which planned to keep most of the 1,700 remaining stores it bought open. By the end of 2014, all corporate stores closed but a few franchise stores stuck it out. After two of the last three U.S. locations in Alaska closed in 2018 and the last store in Australia closed in March 2019, there's only one remaining location of the iconic franchise left worldwide in Bend, Oregon.\n\nBorders: 399 stores\n\nKmart owned the bookstore chain in the early 1990s before spinning it off into a separate company. At one time, the book retailer operated more than 1,000 stores but lost business with the rise of e-readers like Amazon's Kindle and the growth of discount retailers. In 2011, the chain filed for bankruptcy protection and announced some stores would close but then ended up closing its remaining 399 stores. Borders also operated Waldenbooks, which it also shuttered.\n\nCharlotte Russe: 510 stores\n\nThe San Diego-based mall chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early February 2019 and outlined plans to close 94 stores. After not finding a buyer for the remaining stores, the fast-fashion retailer announced in March it would liquidate its 500 stores. Toronto-based clothing manufacturer YM Inc. purchased the Charlotte Russe brand and intellectual property in late March and less than two weeks after the final stores closed, the new owner promoted a comeback. As of Dec. 27, there are 139 new stores, according to the Charlotte Russe website.\n\nDressbarn: 649 stores\n\nAscena Retail Group announced the \"wind-down\" of its Dressbarn stores in May 2019 and closed the last remaining Dressbarn bricks-and-mortar stores closed Dec. 26. New Jersey-based Ascena's other brands include Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, Lane Bryant, Catherines and the Justice tween brand and it sold the intellectual property assets of Dressbarn to a subsidiary of Retail Ecommerce Ventures LLC. The brand's new owner plans to launch a new Dressbarn website in early 2020.\n\nFred's: 568 stores\n\nDiscount merchandise retailer and pharmacy chain Fred's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2019 after a series of closings throughout the year. Before the closures, Fred's had 568 stores in 15 states in the southeastern U.S. The fate of Fred's had been shrouded in uncertainty since the company's plans to profit from a mega-merger between pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid collapsed in late June 2017 amid federal antitrust concerns.\n\nGymboree: 749 stores\n\nThe children’s clothing retailer was the first victim of 2019 when it announced in January 2019 that it filed for bankruptcy protection and would close both Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores and sell its high-end children’s fashion line Janie and Jack, which had 139 stores. The Children's Place purchased the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands for $76 million and is relaunching a new Gymboree.com and a collection in select Children's Place stores in spring 2020. The Gap acquired Janie and Jack for $35 million.\n\nHHGregg: 220 stores\n\nElectronics and appliance retailer HHGregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2017 and had initially planed to close 88 stores in 15 states. It ended up closing all of its 220 stores in 19 states. Today HHGregg exists as an online store.\n\nThe Limited: 250 stores\n\nThe Limited was one of the first retailers to announce mass store closings in 2017 and closed its 250 stores that January. It was formerly a part of L Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Today The Limited is available exclusively at Belk.\n\nPayless ShoeSource: 2,589 stores\n\nThe shoe dropped for the Topeka, Kansas-based discount shoe retailer in February 2019 when it announced plans to close its nearly 2,600 stores in the U.S. and Canada and then filed for bankruptcy protection. While all North American locations closed by the end of June, Payless lives on in the U.S. through Amazon, which is selling some of its well-known shoe brands. There also are 750 brick-and-mortar stores in 35 other countries.\n\nSports Authority: 460 stores\n\nThe sporting goods store chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2016 with initial plans to close about 140 stores. After attempting to restructure debt and not finding any buyers in an auction, all 460 stores shuttered in the summer of 2016. Dick's Sporting Goods bought Sports Authority's intellectual property and some leases for $15 million.\n\nToys R Us: More than 800 stores\n\nSeventeen months after Toys R Us shuttered its last U.S. stores in June 2018, the iconic toy brand’s comeback continued in late November when the new parent company Tru Kids Brands opened its first retail Toys R Us store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, followed by a second store in Houston, Texas in December. “These stores are fundamentally different from the Toys R Us stores that you’ll remember from the past,” Tru Kids Brands CEO Richard Barry told USA TODAY in October. “They are smaller, very immersive, experimental as well.” The new company also opened two “toy wonderlands” called Toys R Us Adventure in Chicago and Atlanta this year and rolled out a new e-commerce website and partnership with Target.\n\nWet Seal: 511 stores\n\nTeen retailer Wet Seal filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2017 and closed its remaining 171 stores after closing two-thirds of its stores in 2015, the first time the company filed for bankruptcy. Founded in Newport Beach, California in 1962, it grew from a small swimwear destination to a once popular and profitable chain for trendy teenage clothes and swimsuits. Today, Wet Seal exists online at www.wetseal.com.\n\nContributing: Nathan Bomey and Joel Shannon, USA TODAY; Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/12/21/2000-s-gave-us-xbox-wii-and-new-generation-fashion-dolls/906402001/", "title": "The 2000s gave us Xbox, Wii and a new generation of fashion dolls", "text": "Toys date back to prehistoric times, when children fashioned sticks, rocks and clay into playthings. More sophisticated toys appeared in Ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt. But it wasn’t until the beginning of the 20th Century that toys were mass produced, promoted through advertising campaigns and became part of the popular culture. This series looks at 100 years of toys, a decade at a time.\n\n2000s\n\nThe new millennium was, as predicted, dominated by computer technology. Adults got into the act, eventually, but many of the games the millennial kids enjoyed took some of the joy out of Christmas morning for their parents. Watching your kids play “Call of Duty” wasn’t quite the same as watching them fuss over their first erector set or Barbie playhouse. Standouts:\n\nBRATZ: Legend has it that MGA Entertainment President Isaac Larian thought that drawings of the proposed Bratz fashion dolls were ugly. But his 11-year-old daughter Jasmin was mesmerized by them.\n\nThe first four dolls (Cloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin) were released in 2001 and, although it took a year or so, the public ultimately agreed with Jasmin. Sporting short pants, micro-miniskirts, high boots and heels, the dolls were deemed a bit too “sassy” by some parents. But their popularity continued to grow, giving Barbie a run for her money.

It was the brainchild of marketer Dick Brams, who had the idea of creating a meal just for kids – one that included a toy. The offerings back then included a McDoodler stencil, a McWrist wallet, an ID bracelet, a puzzle lock, and a spinning top.\n\n24/7 Tempo compiled a list of Happy Meals, using source material from McDonald’s and pop culture sites, that should make a comeback, primarily for reasons of nostalgia but also because there’s a kid in all of us and the toys are just plain fun.\n\nSince 1979, Happy Meals have come with all kinds of toys, many of them movie tie-ins. There have been numerous Disney Happy Meals, featuring such popular characters as Cinderella, Mickey Mouse, Simba, and Snow White.\n\nDisney ended that promotion partnership in 2006 after 10 years because of management concerns over fast-food links to childhood obesity.\n\nThe Teenie Beanie Babies that first appeared in 1997 were so popular they reportedly caused fights at some restaurants.\n\nIf you were a kid in the years between 1979 and 2000, Happy Meal toys may still have a special place in your heart. They may even have a place in your investment strategy, as they are sought-after collectibles. Sets are offered on eBay for hundreds of dollars.\n\nIn your 20s:Here's 2 things to do for retirement\n\nHoliday shopping 2020:1 in 4 Americans already finished buying all their gifts\n\n1982: Playmobil figures\n\nMcDonald's launched the Playmobil Happy Meal in 1982. It ordered 30 million toys and had given away 10 million when it announced a voluntary recall after just over a week because of a choking hazard. Customers were given a box of McDonald's cookies, a cone, or a refund in exchange for the toys.\n\n1983: Hot Wheels\n\nMcDonald's gave away regular Hot Wheels mainline models from 1983 to 1990. In 1991, the fast-food company started including its own car designs in Happy Meals for the first time. They came in plastic baggies rather than full blister packs.\n\n1983: Play-Doh\n\nMcDonald's launched Play-Doh Happy Meal in 1983. While the exact ingredients in Play-Doh are proprietary, maker Hasbro says that the ingredients are primarily water, salt, and flour, which sounds like a meal in itself, although it also notes that Play-Doh is not a food item.\n\n1984: Astrosniks\n\nAstrosniks, also known as Sniks, were fictional characters created by the German company Bullyland in 1975. Astrosniks were licensed to about 50 manufacturers, including McDonald's, in 1983 and 1984, when they were first included in Happy Meals.\n\n1984: Ronald McDonald Cloth Doll\n\nRonald McDonald is one of the most recognizable corporate mascots in the world, so it is no surprise that the doll was also a Happy Meal giveaway. The clown character is so well known it has even become part of American culture – there's a Ronald McDonald cloth doll in the National Museum of American History.\n\n1985: My Little Pony\n\nMy Little Pony – a toy line featuring colorful bodies and manes – was launched in 1982. It was included as a Happy Meal toy in 1985 and was produced in the United States up to 1992. It was so popular it spawned an animated film and two television series.\n\n1986: Berenstain Bears\n\nThe Berenstain Bears were created by cartoonists Stanley Melvin Berenstain and Janice Marian Grant in 1962. The characters have been featured in books, games, puzzles, software, and clothing, as well as Happy Meal toys.\n\n1986: Halloween Pails\n\nMcDonald's released its first line of Halloween Pails for kids to collect candy in 1985. Also known as Boo Buckets, the pails came as different characters: McBoo, McPunk'n, and McGoblin.\n\n1987: Changeables\n\nChangeables, also known as McRobots, were produced by McDonald's itself and given away in three series in 1987, 1989, and 1990. They were named for their ability to transform into something else – primarily McDonald's food items.\n\n1987: Muppet Babies\n\nAs the name suggests, Muppet Babies were baby versions of the famous characters created by Jim Henson. They came with their own transportation: Baby Kermit on a skateboard; Baby Piggy in a pink car; Baby Gonzo on a tricycle; and Baby Fozzie on a hobby horse.\n\n1988: Bambi Figurines\n\nIn 1988, McDonald's offered poseable toys based on the Bambi characters, including Thumper and Flower, in addition to Bambi himself.\n\n1988: Fraggle Rock\n\nFraggle Rock was another Jim Henson creation, featuring the Fraggle gang. The Happy Meal set included Gobo, Red, Mokey and Wembley Fraggle in different cars. There were two more toys without cars for children under 3.\n\n1988: McNugget Buddies\n\nMcNugget Buddies are another McDonald's creation – the company offered this line of Happy Meal toy adaptations of Chicken McNuggets characters in different costumes.\n\n1988: Oliver & Company\n\nIn 1988, McDonald's offered four finger puppets based on characters from the Disney movie \"Oliver & Company:\" Oliver, Dodger, Francis, and Georgette.\n\n1989: Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n\nThe Disney animated television series \"Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\" generated a lot of merchandise, including Happy Meal toys. There were four sets.\n\n1989: Fry Kids\n\nThe Fry Kids are McDonald's characters that were used to promote the chain's fries. They were used in television commercials with a jingle that said, \"Keep your eyes on your fries.\" They started out as the Fry Guys in the 1970s and were offered with Happy Meals in 1989.\n\n1989: Garfield Vehicles\n\nMcDonald's offered four Garfield toys with Happy Meals in 1989. They came with their own transportation, including a skateboard, a scooter, and a car.\n\n1989: Mickey's Birthdayland Race Cars\n\nDisney created Mickey's Birthdayland to celebrate Mickey Mouse's 60th birthday in 1988. McDonald's partnered with Disney to mark the occasion with these Happy Meal toys.\n\n1989: The Little Mermaid\n\nThese Happy Meal toys were based on characters from the animated Disney movie \"The Little Mermaid.\" There were Ariel, Prince Eric, Flounder, and Ursula, and special gold editions also.\n\n1989: Flounder from 'The Little Mermaid'\n\nFlounder appeared in the 1989 animated Disney movie \"The Little Mermaid.\" He was also a Happy Meal toy that year, along with the other characters.\n\n1991: Barbie\n\nBarbie never seems to go out of fashion. Barbie Happy Meals were first offered in 1991 and have reappeared regularly since then.\n\n1991: McDino Changeables\n\nThis Happy Meal featured a set of eight transforming dinosaur-like toys with names like McDino Cone, Big Mac-O-Saurus Rex, and Quarter Pounder with Cheese-O-Saur. There were also toys that didn't transform for children under three.\n\n1992: Batman Car Figures\n\nThis Happy Meal was somewhat controversial as it was a tie-in with the Tim Burton film \"Batman Returns,\" which was rated PG-13.\n\n1992: Potato Head Kids\n\nThe Potato Head Kids featured quite a lineup: Big Chip, Dimples, Lolly, Lumpy, Potato Dumpling, Potato Puff, Slick, Slugger, Smarty Pants, Spike, Spud, and Tulip. Perhaps it won't come as a surprise to learn that McDonald's is the world's biggest purchaser of potatoes.\n\n1993: Dinosaurs\n\nMcDonald's released a set of six Dinosaurs toys, as well as one for children under 3, in 1993. The toys were hinged and had a button that made them move.\n\n1994: Bobby's World\n\nBobby's World, an animated television series, ran from 1990 to 1998 on FOX Kids. It was about the daily life of Bobby Generic, who was voiced by Howie Mandel. Bobby's transportation was anything but generic – the Happy Meal toys included a spaceship and a submarine.\n\n1995: Cinderella\n\nThis Happy Meal toy was part of the Disney Masterpiece Collection, made to commemorate the release of the iconic animated movie.\n\n1995: Dodger from 'Oliver & Company'\n\nDodger is a character from Disney's 1988 movie \"Oliver & Company.\" He is based on the Artful Dodger from the Charles Dickens' novel \"Oliver Twist.\"\n\n1995: Pocahontas\n\nThis Happy Meal was a tie-in with the 1995 Disney animated movie \"Pocahontas.\" As well as the heroine, the toys included John Smith and his boss and Grandmother Willow.\n\n1995: Princess Aurora from 'Sleeping Beauty'\n\nAnother Happy Meal inspired by the Disney Masterpiece Collection was Princess Aurora, the main character in the 1959 animated feature film \"Sleeping Beauty.\"\n\n1995: Simba from 'The Lion King'\n\nSimba, which is Swahili for lion, is the King of the Pride Lands in Disney's Lion King franchise.

The researchers looked at 13 species of hoofed mammal (or ungulate), including horses, sheep, deer and giraffes, living in captivity in zoos in Europe, and observed each of them to work out their social hierarchies and the levels of integration in the groups. They also gauged their fear of new objects by placing colourful bowls next to their feeding spots. They then left closed containers full of the animals’ favourite foods around their enclosures, and watched to see how they responded. They found that with all the species, it was the animals who were less well-integrated – and less fearful of the new – who were most adept at getting into the boxes to get the treats. The authors of the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, told The New Scientist that there could be two explanations for this. It could be that socially isolated individuals cannot count on others in the group to provide support and assistance, so they have to learn to be more innovative. However, it could also be that loners are not actually outcasts, but have opted to live on the margins because they can figure things out on their own, and so don’t need others.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/11/megalodon-tooth-found-maryland-beach/11031618002/", "title": "'I didn't think it was real': 9-year-old girl finds huge megalodon tooth ...", "text": "It took nearly a decade, but Molly Sampson found what she had been searching for her whole life.\n\nIt happened Christmas morning when the 9-year-old girl was out searching for shark teeth with family in Calvert Beach, Maryland.\n\nIt was there Molly waded into the cold waters of the Chesapeake Bay and pulled out the once-in-a-lifetime find: a 5-inch-long megalodon tooth.\n\n\"She was over-the-moon excited,\" Molly's mother, Alicia Sampson, told USA TODAY on Wednesday. \"It was something she dreamt about finding. She's been shark tooth hunting since age 1 when she would crawl along the beach.\"\n\nA homeschooled student from Prince Frederick, Molly has collected more than 400 shark teeth since before she could walk. But the discovery marked the fourth grader's biggest find yet.\n\nStephen Godfrey, curator of paleontology at the Calvert Marine Museum, where the girl took her find, confirmed that the tooth belonged to the extinct shark megalodon (Otodus megalodon), which disappeared millions of years ago.\n\nThe meg is believed to be one of the largest predators that ever lived until its extinction, and scientists believe it could have grown 50 to 60 feet long. For a long time, scientists believed the megalodon's closest relative was the great white shark, but research shows it is most closely related to the mako shark, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nChest waders for Christmas\n\nLast year, Alicia Sampson said, Molly and her 17-year-old sister, Natalie, asked for insulated chest waders as a Christmas present for shark-tooth hunting.\n\nThe siblings' wish came true when they opened gifts Christmas morning, and as soon as they finished breakfast, the girls and their father, Bruce Sampson, headed to nearby Calvert Cliffs.\n\nWhile wading in the cold, knee-deep water, Molly said, she noticed the tooth, reached both arms into the water and grabbed it.\n\n\"I was so surprised,\" Molly told USA TODAY. \"I thought I was dreaming. I didn't think it was real.\"\n\nRare size for megalodon tooth\n\nMolly said she put the tooth into a beach bag and went to the museum to have experts check it out.\n\n\"They were really excited,\" Molly said.\n\n\"Megalodon teeth are found on a fairly regular basis along Calvert Cliffs. However, one that large is rare indeed. Perhaps a few each year,\" Godfrey said.\n\nBecause of its large teeth, experts believe it feasted on whales, large fish and probably other sharks. From the size of the tooth, Godfrey said, it would have come from a fish 45 to 50 feet long. He also said that based on where the tooth was found and the age of the sediments from which it most likely originated, the tooth probably about 15 million years old.\n\nAs she hunted for oyster mushrooms in the woods near her home Wednesday morning during a school field trip with her mother and sister, Molly explained she wasn't the first in her family to find a massive shark tooth.\n\nHer father, who has been fossil hunting in the area along Chesapeake Bay since he was a child, also snagged one a few years back.\n\nBut hers was \"much bigger.\"\n\n\"His was 3 inches. It's like a baby,\" Molly said, laughing.\n\nMolly said she plans to keep the ginormous relic in her collection and maybe one day put it in a shadow box.\n\nIn the meantime, she said, she's considering becoming a paleontologist when she grows up, or \"something involving working with animals.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMegalodon, the giant shark that lived more than 23 million years ago and was inspiration for the movie “The Meg,” was almost four times bigger than the great white shark that cruises our oceans today.\n\nHowever, the two shark species, which once coexisted, likely hunted some of the same prey. This competition could potentially have been one reason why the 65-foot-long (20-meter-long) megalodon went extinct, a new study has suggested.\n\nTo arrive at this finding, the researchers involved in the study used a new technique. They analyzed dietary signatures contained in the teeth of 13 extinct shark species and 20 modern sharks to understand where they fit in the food chain – also known as their trophic level.\n\n“Megalodon is typically portrayed as a super-sized, monstrous shark in novels and films, but the reality is that we still know very little about the extinct shark,” said study author Kenshu Shimada, a professor of paleobiology at DePaul University in Chicago and research associate at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Kansas.\n\n“Our new study shows that the dietary range of the early Pliocene great white shark is very similar to that of megalodon, indicating that our data do not contradict the competition hypothesis,” he said via email.\n\nThe researchers were able glean this information by looking at the presence of different isotopes, or variants, of the chemical element zinc preserved in the sharks’ tooth enamel.\n\nZinc is essential for living organisms and plays a crucial role in bone development. The ratio of heavy and light zinc isotopes in the teeth preserves a record of the kind of animal matter that the sharks ate.\n\n“Zinc isotopes can be used as ecological indicators because of the ratio of these two different isotopes changes as you move up the food chain,” said coauthor Michael Griffiths, a geochemist and professor in the department of environmental science at William Paterson University in New Jersey.\n\nLead author Jeremy McCormack, postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, isolates zinc from shark tooth samples in a clean, metal-free laboratory. MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology\n\nFor example, if megalodon ate great white sharks, its higher position in the food chain would be reflected in the isotopic record. But the study found the two species had some overlap, suggesting they shared similar prey items. However, the authors cautioned that they cannot rule out megalodon preying on great whites, given that its isotope values, and especially a close relative of megalodon, called Chubutensis megalodon, had values lower than any modern and fossil marine vertebrate measured.\n\nFeeding at the same trophic level does not necessarily imply direct competition between megalodon and great white sharks for the same prey, as both species could have specialized in different prey. However, at least some overlap in food items between both species was likely, the study said.\n\n“Like great whites today, they likely fed on large fish. The smaller sized great whites likely did not require as much food as megalodon did, so they would have had the competitive advantage if they were feeding on similar prey items,” Griffiths said via email.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday.\n\nThis study was the first time that zinc isotopes related to diet have been proven to preserve in fossilized shark teeth.\n\nA similar technique, using nitrogen isotopes to study the dietary signatures for other groups of animals, is well established, the study said. However, nitrogen in teeth dentine doesn’t preserve well enough to study animals that went extinct millions of years ago.\n\nThe technique using zinc isotopes could be applied to other extinct animals to understand their diet and ecology.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/world/shark-week-facts-scn/index.html", "title": "Sharks are millions of years older than dinosaurs and 5 other facts ..."}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/china/960353/the-truth-behind-chinas-world-leading-scientific-research", "title": "The truth behind China's 'world-leading' scientific research | The ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Eli Lilly said that those with mild Alzheimer’s in its 1,736-person clinical trial “showed 35% less clinical decline than did those who received a placebo”.\n\nThe results are similar to those of lecanemab, a drug made by US company Biogen and Eisai in Tokyo, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January.\n\nDonanemab targets amyloid protein, which is believed to cause dementia by accumulating in the brain and damaging neurons. The trial results provide strong evidence that amyloid is a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nBut researchers have warned that questions remain “as to the drug’s clinical usefulness, as well as whether the modest benefit outweighs the risk of harmful side effects”, said Nature. In the clinical trial, three deaths were reported among people taking the drug, two of which were attributed to adverse events such as brain swelling or microhaemorrhages.\n\nThe results have been described as “transformative in an enormously important way from a scientific point of view” by Jeffrey Cummings, a neuroscientist at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “They’re terrific,” he told Nature.\n\nOthers, however, are more cautious. Neurologist Marsel Mesulam, at Northwestern University in Chicago, stated that “clinically, their significance is doubtful” and that the modest effect suggests factors other than amyloid contribute to Alzheimer’s disease progression. Eli Lilly plans to file for approval by the FDA by the end of June based on these results.\n\nThe experimental drug is just one of the many scientific breakthroughs that offer hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s and dementia in 2023.\n\nGene therapy A new gene therapy for Alzheimer’s has been found to significantly lower levels of the tau proteins that are thought to cause the disease. In a Phase 1b trial involving 46 patients, the drug BIIB080 (MAPTRx) – which was injected into the nervous system via the spinal cord – was found to be safe and well tolerated, in a study published in the journal Nature. It’s not yet clear if it improves the clinical condition of Alzheimer’s patients, but it did cut levels of tau by 50%, on average, by silencing the messages from DNA that create abnormal tau proteins within cells. Further trials will be needed to show if this actually leads to a clinical benefit, reports The Daily Telegraph, but it raises hopes of a treatment to slow or even reverse the development of Alzheimer’s.\n\nSleeping pills In a study published in March in the Annals of Neurology, people who took a sleeping pill before bed had lower levels of the amyloid beta protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Poor sleep has been linked to the condition. However, the scientists, from Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, stressed that the research was in its early stages, and said that it was too soon to recommend that people with insomnia take sleeping pills to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. The drug used in the study was suvorexant. It is used in the US under the brand name Belsomra, but it has not been approved for use in the UK.\n\nHearing aids Middle-aged adults who notice they are losing their hearing should immediately start wearing hearing aids to reduce their risk of dementia, a study published in The Lancet suggested. Drawing on data from the UK Biobank, researchers in China studied 438,000 adults who had an average age of 56. One in four reported some level of hearing loss as they grew older, and these people were 42% more likely than the others to be diagnosed with dementia. But wearing a hearing aid eliminated this increased risk. It is thought that wearing the aids helps maintain connections between brain cells, while also preventing other negative effects of hearing loss such as reduced social interaction. Previous studies have suggested that hearing “may account for about 8 per cent of the potentially modifiable risk of developing dementia”, The Times reported, yet in the UK, about 80% of people experiencing hearing loss do not use hearing aids.\n\nMediterranean diet Eating a Mediterranean diet – rich in whole grains, nuts, fish, vegetables and fruit – can substantially reduce the risk of dementia, researchers have found. Their findings, published in the journal BMC Medicine, are based on analysis of data on more than 60,000 people from the UK Biobank (most of whom were of European ancestry), who had completed a survey about their eating habits. The researchers scored individuals according to how closely they followed a Mediterranean diet, and noted their genetic risk for dementia. Over the course of nearly a decade, there were 882 cases of dementia, but those who followed a strict Mediterranean diet had a 23% lower risk of developing the condition than those who did not, and this did not seem to be affected by their genetic risk. The researchers, from Newcastle University, conclude that advice to eat a healthy, largely plant-based diet could be incorporated into future strategies for preventing dementia. However, other experts pointed out that it is quite likely that people who eat healthily have a more healthy lifestyle overall, making the impact of their diet hard to assess.\n\nHealthy hearts People with healthy hearts in middle age are likely to live significantly longer without conditions such as cancer and dementia than those whose heart health is poor, a study has indicated. Researchers from Tulane University in the US analysed more than 135,000 participants in the UK Biobank project, whose heart health had been scored according to various measures, including diet, body mass index, cholesterol levels, blood sugar and blood pressure. Their preliminary findings were that the women who’d had the highest scores aged 50 could expect to live another 33 disease-free years, on average – nine more than those with the lowest score. For men, the difference was about seven years. And even the majority of participants who only achieved intermediate scores for heart health were likely to be free of chronic illness for markedly longer than those with low scores – six years for women and four for men. Separately, a review of existing research on the impact of exercise on health found that if everyone were to be physically active for just 11 minutes a day, one in 20 cases of cardiovascular disease would be prevented, along with nearly one in 30 cases of cancer.\n\nVitamin D Taking vitamin D tablets may help stave off dementia in older people, a study has found. Previous research has shown that vitamin D plays a role in clearing the brain of the amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s; but studies into whether taking supplements can ward off the disease have had conflicting results. To explore this further, scientists at the University of Exeter looked at almost 12,400 American adults with an average age of 71 who were followed for ten years. During this time, 2,696 of them were diagnosed with dementia. At the start, 37% of the participants were regularly taking vitamin D – and the members of this group were 40% less likely to be diagnosed with the condition than the rest of the cohort. The vitamin’s apparently protective effect was particularly marked in women, possibly because declining levels of oestrogen during menopause can make it harder to produce the vitamin. Its effects were also significantly greater in people who did not carry the APOE4 gene, which is associated with an elevated risk of Alzheimer’s. The researchers speculate that people with this gene absorb vitamin D better in the intestine, which might reduce the impact of the supplements.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/955518/how-did-nanoplastics-end-up-at-both-the-north-and-south-poles", "title": "How did nanoplastics end up at the North and South Pole? | The ...", "text": "For the first time researchers have identified the presence of tiny polluting plastic particles at both of the world’s polar regions.\n\nMicroplastics have previously been found in Arctic ice samples, but “it turns out there’s an even smaller and more toxic form of plastic pollution infiltrating remote reaches of the globe”, said Eco Watch.\n\nNanoplastics have often “escaped attention” from research into polar plastic pollution, said a team from Utrecht University in their paper, published in the Environmental Research journal. Nanoparticles are invisible to the naked eye, and can’t be detected through standard scientific sampling and measuring processes.\n\nInstead studies have generally focused on microplastics, which measure between one micrometre and five millimetres and are known to cause a number of environmental problems and disrupt marine ecosystems. Nanoparticles, which are often the byproduct of microplastics breaking down in natural environments, measure less than one micrometre in size.\n\nThe research team analysed samples from the Earth’s most remote regions, the Greenland ice core and the Antarctica sea ice core. They identified six types of plastic nanoparticles present in the first, including dust from tyre wear, and three in the second. The volume of particles found indicates “that the tiny particles are now pervasive around the world”, said The Guardian.\n\nPolyethylene was the most common particle found in the samples, accounting for more than half the total particles analysed. It is one of the most commonly used plastic materials in the world, and is used to manufacture household items including bin bags, plastic films and bottles.\n\n“Nanoplastics is really a bigger pollution problem than we thought,” said Dusan Materic, who led the project. The data also suggests that this “is not a new problem”. The Greenland core contained nanoplastics that indicated this type of pollution had been “happening all the way from the 1960s. So organisms in that region, and likely all over the world, have been exposed to it for quite some time now,” he exaplined.\n\nIt is generally understood that nanoparticles are easily carried long distances by the wind due to their light weight. The researchers concluded that the nanoplastics likely reached the North and South Pole regions through a “combination of complex processes including both atmospheric and marine transport, (re)emission, deposition and ice incorporation”. They concluded that the particles likely reached Greenland through the air, and Antarctica through ocean currents.\n\n“Plastics are part of the cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet,” said The Guardian. A study published by scientists at the Stockholm Resilience Centre last week said that the level of synthetic chemicals in the Earth’s ecosystems has now exceeded the planetary boundary for environmental pollutants.\n\nAnd nanoparticles could come with serious health risks too. Pollution expert Dr Fay Couceiro told The Guardian: “Aside from the environmental damage caused by plastics, there is growing concern about what inhaling and ingesting microplastics is doing to our bodies.”\n\nThough research into the specific risks of nanoparticles is ongoing, they are known to be toxic to both marine organisms and humans. “Nanoplastics are very toxicologically active compared to, for instance, microplastics, and that’s why this is very important,” said Materic.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2018/09/15/megalodon-shark-teeth-may-hold-ancient-climate-secrets/1300919002/", "title": "Megalodon shark teeth may hold ancient climate secrets", "text": "Scientists think the fossil teeth of the megalodon, the largest predatory shark that ever roamed the ocean, holds clues into how the shark behaved during prehistoric climate changes.\n\nWilliam Paterson University professors Michael Griffiths and Martin Becker have begun to research the chemistry of the ancient shark teeth to reconstruct shark body temperature and dietary behavior as well as seawater chemistry dating back 15 million years.\n\nThe researchers are hoping to answer if the extinct species was endothermic — able to produce its own heat — or not.\n\nBecker, who is a paleontologist by trade, said an evolutionary detail such as how the shark regulated its body temperature would shed more light onto what caused the demise of the megalodon many millions of years ago.\n\nThe megalodon is thought to have grown to 60 feet and exert a crushing bite — with force up to 41,000 pounds of pressure — that enabled them to crunch bones and snack on large marine animals such as whales. The fossilized teeth, which have been recovered in many coastal regions, measure up to 7 inches.\n\nN.J. History: 1916 shark attacks: The day the terror began\n\nBecker and Griffiths are using teeth gathered in California, Japan, North Carolina and Western Europe, which they will send to labs to find out the ratio of carbon to oxygen in the isotopes preserved in the enameloid.\n\nThe species lived between 2.6 million to 23 million years ago and several hypotheses have been floated for its extinction, including a cooler ocean during the ice ages, loss of nurseries from lower sea levels and competition for food with ancient, now also extinct species of killer whales. See a documentary on whales in the above video.\n\n\"That's one idea for sure. I'm more of the opinion that the 'Megs' inability to move poleward limited its access to its food source whales that could range more northward into colder water,\" said Becker.\n\nFound Jaws: Collector's fossilized teeth, evidence of 60-foot shark\n\nTheir probe, which earned a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, aims to discover the historic relationship between environmental temperature, ocean chemistry, and the internal body temperature, evolution, and habitat of various marine vertebrates across two important geologic time periods: the Mid-Miocene between 15 million and 17 million years ago, and the Pliocene between 2.5 million and 5 million years ago.\n\n\"These periods of time encompass some of the largest oceanographic and climatic changes in the earth’s history,\" said Griffiths, a geochemist and paleoclimatologist.\n\nThe researchers are also hoping to be able to compare the behavior of the megalodon to that of sharks today.\n\nThe researchers say the world's oceans are currently warming up at an extremely rapid rate that is leading poleward habitat shifts of many marine organisms, including sharks.\n\nThese habitat shifts result in many challenges, such as the management of fisheries' resources, as competition among species changes and new ecosystems are developed.\n\nMany sharks and tunas species today are able to produce their own heat, including great white sharks and bluefin tuna, two of the largest of their species.\n\nDan Radel: @danielradelapp; 732-643-4072; dradel@gannettnj.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/953560/is-climate-change-reversible", "title": "Is climate change reversible? | The Week UK", "text": "The words “extreme”, “intolerable” and “record-breaking” are cropping up more and more in news headlines about our planet’s climate. The Pakistani city of Jacobabad recently officially surpassed the temperature threshold that humans can withstand - “albeit briefly”, The Telegraph notes. Days later, experts in the US reported that a “heat dome” was to blame for blistering temperatures in the Pacific Northwest that saw the mercury hitting 46.6°C in the Oregon city of Portland. On the other side of the Atlantic, more than 150 people have died as a result of extreme flooding in Germany, with hundreds more missing, and further flood-related fatalities reported in neighbouring Belgium. And in Asia, authorities in Henan province issued the highest level of weather warning this week as torrential rain swept across wide swathes of north and central China. Each of these extreme weather events has triggered fresh warnings from scientists and politicians about the ever-increasing threat posed by climate change. As Germany and Belgium, along with parts of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, reeled from the effects of days of intense rainfall there, Potsdam-based climatologist Dieter Gerten told National Geographic that the situation was “not so surprising” to scientists. “The increase of extreme events is something we’ve seen in climate model projections,\" he added. So what can science tell us about the current course of climate change, and whether it can be slowed - or even reversed? Heating up Human activities have been heating the planet since the Industrial Revolution, a period commonly used as a baseline against which global temperatures are monitored. Global average temperatures increased rapidly in the second half of the 20th century, and “this warming has been particularly rapid since the 1970s“, says the Met Office. This acceleration has triggered calls for united action by world leaders. The “historic, durable and ambitious” goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement were lauded as “the world’s greatest diplomatic success” by The Guardian at the time of the signing. But on the treaty's fifth anniversary, in December 2020, the president of this year’s COP26 summit, Alok Sharma, told national leaders to be “honest” with themselves and admit that “as encouraging as all this ambition is, it is not enough”. Skip advert\n\nIn May, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) secretary-general Professor Petteri Taalas warned that new research findings had delivered “yet another wake-up call” about the need to fast-track commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. According to a WMO climate update, there is a 90% chance that one of the years between 2021 and 2025 will become the hottest on record, and a 40% likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily reach 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the same period. A separate WMO report published in April warned that monitoring showed that global greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2020, “despite setbacks from Covid-19” to industrial processes. And the decade from 2011 was the warmest on record, the report said. Future outlook Signatories of the Paris Agreement committed to limiting global warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. As the World Resources Institute (WRI) noted back in 2018, this difference of “half a degree of warming matters - a lot”. The London-based think tank pointed to research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of the world’s leading climate scientists, which found that with a 2C increase, 37% of the world’s population would be exposed to severe heat waves at least once in five years, compared with 14% at 1.5C of warming. And “at 2C warming, 18% of insects globally, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates are projected to lose more than half of their ranges”, said the WRI. “With 1.5C of warming, this is reduced by two-thirds for insects, and by half for plants and vertebrates.” The difference of half a degree could also prove crucial in the Arctic, where global warming is triggering rising sea levels, sea ice loss and changes to permafrost. “Over the past 49 years, the Arctic has warmed three times faster than the world as a whole,” according to the latest annual update from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, which predicts that “the first ice-free September in the Arctic could occur as early as 2040”. Global warming is also expected to lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Freak weather “such as abnormally heavy rainfall, prolonged droughts, desertification, environmental degradation, or sea-level rise and cyclones, are already causing an average of more than 20 million people to leave their homes and move to other areas in their countries each year”, says the UN Refugee Agency. Climate change has major implications for the production of goods and services needed to sustain communities too, especially in industies such as agriculture. A report published in The Lancet recently warns that “both labour supply and productivity are projected to decrease under future climate change in most parts of the world, and particularly in tropical regions”.

Ukraine is alive and kicking.”\n\nBut alongside Zelensky’s gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military even as they fight on. At one point, Zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, “We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.”\n\nZelensky’s visit to Washington marks his first trip outside his homeland since it was invaded 300 days ago, arriving Wednesday afternoon to set a course for the future of the war alongside a key Western ally.\n\nOn “the frontline of tyranny,” Zelensky argued during his speech to Congress, American support “is crucial not just to stand in such (a) fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.”\n\n“The world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,” he added. “Our two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, I know it – the point where Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.”\n\n“Your money is not charity,” he asserted to Congress. “It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” Zelensky also called on lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Russia.\n\nStill, despite that disparity in resources, Zelensky said, “Ukraine holds its line and will never surrender.”\n\nIn his speech, Zelensky harkened back to American history, referencing the Battle of the Bulge, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Battle of Saratoga. Just like “brave American soldiers which held their lines” and fought against Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany in 1944, Ukrainian soldiers “are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas,” Zelensky said.\n\nHe also briefly discussed a 10-point peace formula and summit that he told US President Joe Biden about during an earlier meeting at the White House. Zelensky claimed Biden supported the peace initiatives.\n\nZelensky also recalled his recent visit to the frontlines – Bakhmut in Donbas – which has been under siege since May. There, he said, “every inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour.” In the climatic moment of the speech, he unveiled a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut that he gave as a gift to the Congress.\n\n“The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever have. It’s true, but our defense forces stand,” he added.\n\nRussia, Zelensky argued in strong terms, has “found an ally” in Iran.\n\n“Iran’s deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other,” he said. “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.”\n\nZelensky’s White House visit\n\nEarlier Wednesday the Ukrainian leader visited the White House, where he met with Biden and held a joint news conference, during which the duo displayed a united front on their approach to the war.\n\n“I think … we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous and secure Ukraine is the vision – we both want this war to end,” Biden told reporters in the White House East Room.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden relayed that he felt it was “particularly meaningful” to speak to Zelensky in person and “look each other in the eye.” The Ukrainian president’s leadership, Biden said, has inspired the world.\n\n“We understand in our bones that Ukraine’s fight is part of something much bigger,” Biden continued.\n\nBiden said Zelensky has shown his “strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats,” and said the US was standing alongside Ukraine in maintaining “core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\nBoth Biden and Zelensky addressed the Russians during the news conference, with the Ukranian president repeatedly calling Russian forces “terrorists” and Biden underscoring the importance of being “clear” about Russia’s actions.\n\n“It is purposely attacking Ukraine critical infrastructure, destroying the system to provide heat and light (to) Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another,” Biden said. The war, Biden later argued, “could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just … pulled out. But that’s not gonna happen.”\n\nBut the two leaders, it seems, still have different perspectives on their approach to pursuing peace with Russia.\n\nEarly in the news conference, Biden said Zelensky was open to pursuing a “just peace.” Later, when asked by a reporter to share his idea of a fair way to end the war, the Ukrainian leader responded, “For me, as a president, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.”\n\n“There can’t be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these … inhumans, I would say,” he added.\n\nMeeting comes at a critical moment\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nZelensky arrived to the South Lawn just after 2 p.m. ET, eschewing a suit for his now-familiar military green shirt. A military honor guard lined the White House driveway as his black vehicle pulled toward the building.\n\n“I understand that we have very important topics and we’ll discuss them, everything, so many challenges in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, from energy to the situation on the battlefield,” Zelensky said in the Oval Office. “But first of all, really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians, from our nation.”\n\nThe wartime visit was meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Biden’s ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested.\n\nIt has also been an opportunity for Biden and top American officials to sound out Zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end.\n\n“Together with our partners, we’re also going to impose costs on the Kremlin and will support Ukraine in pursuing a just peace,” Biden said in the Oval Office, a reference to how Zelensky has said he hopes to see the war end. “President Zelensky, the United States stands with the brave people in Ukraine.”\n\nSitting before a roaring fireplace, Zelensky offered Biden a military cross medal from a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front lines.\n\n“He said, ‘Give it to a very brave president,’” Zelensky said.\n\n“Undeserved but much appreciated,” Biden replied as he accepted the medal, asking if it would be possible to contact the Ukrainian soldier.\n\nA surprise visit\n\nThe trip, which US and Ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. After arriving in Poland by train, Zelensky flew to Washington aboard an American military aircraft, US officials said. He arrived in the US shortly after midday at Joint Base Andrews, just outside the nation’s capital.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC on December 21, 2022. - Zelensky is in Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and address Congress -- his first trip abroad since Russia invaded in February.

A formal invitation was extended a week ago that Zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip.\n\nZelensky, who the official said was “very keen” to visit the US, determined those parameters met his needs, and the US set to work executing them. The trip was finally confirmed on Sunday.\n\nTight security was enforced around Zelensky’s visit amid concerns that Russia wants to incapacitate the Ukrainian president, a source close to the Ukrainian leader told CNN on Wednesday. Because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials – as well as embassy staff in the US – were not informed about the schedule of the visit.\n\nAccording to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. Scheduling also had to be worked with the White House to assess availability for this to happen.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between Ukraine and the US. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nThe new, $1.8 billion package Biden unveiled includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraine’s to fend of Russian air attacks. CNN was first to report the US was expected to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nDuring the news conference, Biden told CNN’s Phil Mattingly that the missile system is defensive, not escalatory. Zelensky said the system is “something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.”\n\n“Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security and I know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope,” Zelensky added.\n\nHe also suggested Ukraine would want more of the systems.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-zelensky-evacuation-intl/index.html", "title": "Zelensky defiant: Ukrainian president refuses US offer to evacuate ...", "text": "1.

Mark Milley said the Russian military was “really hurting bad” after nearly nine months of war in which the Kremlin has failed to achieve any of its goals. The Ukrainians have racked up “success after success after success,” Milley quipped, while the Russians “have failed every single time.”\n\nThose failures, Milley suggested, which come on top of Ukraine’s recent liberation of Kherson, may even allow Ukraine to push for what it is unlikely to achieve militarily: a withdrawal of Russian forces.\n\n“There may be a political solution where politically the Russians withdraw,” Milley said at a press conference Wednesday. “You want to negotiate at a time when you’re at your strength, and your opponent is at weakness. And it’s possible, maybe, that there’ll be a political solution. All I’m saying is there’s a possibility for it.”\n\nHe was speaking following a meeting of allies who make up the Ukraine Contact Group and after leaders of Poland and NATO said the missile that killed two people in Polish territory on Tuesday was likely fired by Ukrainian forces defending their country against a barrage of Russian strikes, and that the incident appeared to be an accident. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, speaking at the same press conference, said the US has seen no information so far that “contradicts” Poland’s “preliminary assessment”.\n\nMilley appeared to be making a concerted effort to lay out his position on the state of the war, one week after he appeared to push for negotiations amid stabilizing front lines and a potential winter lull in fighting in comments that ruffled some allies and members of his own administration. Speaking in New York last Wednesday, Milley said both Russia and Ukraine will have to realize that military victory is impossible to achieve and that a negotiated end to the conflict would end the suffering of war.\n\n“When there’s an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it,” Milley said at the time.\n\nThose remarks forced the Biden administration to reassure Ukraine that there had been no change in the US position of allowing the country to decide its own future or to pressure Kyiv into negotiations.\n\nAustin underscored that position on Wednesday, standing next to Milley at the press conference. “What’s a good time to negotiate? We’ve said repeatedly that the Ukrainians are going to decide that and not us.”\n\nNevertheless, Milley laid out the realities of the fight ahead, with winter already setting in on the battlefields of Ukraine. Russia has knocked out parts of Ukraine’s energy grid and infrastructure, leaving many homes without electricity or water. Ukraine’s military has conducted successful counteroffensives in the east and the south, but the front lines are stabilizing, Milley said, and the fight tends to slow down in winter.\n\nRussia’s mobilization efforts have also given them more manpower for the war, even if their troops arrive ill-equipped and with hardly any training. The odds of Ukraine achieving the outright military victory of pushing Russia out of the country are “not high, militarily,” he said.\n\nThis time, Milley was more careful with his talk of negotiations, implicitly acknowledging that the chances of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reaching any sort of agreement still seem very off.\n\n“So if there’s a slowdown in the actual tactical fighting, if that happens, then that may become a window, possibly – it may not – for a political solution, or at least the beginnings of talks to initiate a political solution,” he said.\n\nBut one day after Russia launched perhaps the largest barrage of missiles against Ukraine, the US and the West made it clear they’re preparing for a longer conflict, one in which Kyiv still needs air defenses and ammunition for the fight ahead.\n\n“We will be there for as long as it takes to keep Ukraine free,” said Milley.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/europe/students-allege-racism-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Indian and African students fleeing Ukraine say they face racism at ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, foreign students attempting to leave the country say they are experiencing racist treatment by Ukrainian security forces and border officials.\n\nOne African medical student told CNN that she and other foreigners were ordered off the public transit bus at a checkpoint between Ukraine and Poland border.\n\nThey were told to stand aside as the bus drove off with only Ukrainian nationals on board, she says.\n\nRachel Onyegbule, a Nigerian first-year medical student in Lviv was left stranded at the border town of Shehyni, some 400 miles from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.\n\nShe told CNN: “More than 10 buses came and we were watching everyone leave. We thought after they took all the Ukrainians they would take us, but they told us we had to walk, that there were no more buses and told us to walk.”\n\n“My body was numb from the cold and we haven’t slept in about 4 days now. Ukrainians have been prioritized over Africans – men and women – at every point. There’s no need for us to ask why. We know why. I just want to get home,” Onyegbule told CNN in a telephone call Sunday as she waited in line at the border to cross into Poland.\n\nOnyegbule says she eventually got her exit document stamped on Monday morning around 4.30 a.m. local time.\n\nUniversity students, including many from Nigeria, fleeing from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, stow their luggage as they get on their transport bus near the Hungarian-Ukrainian border in the village of Tarpa in Hungary on February 28, 2022.

A lot of people are stranded there. They don’t allow Indians to go through.\n\nCNN has been unable to confirm the identities or affiliations of the people who operated the checkpoints, but Ijantkar said they were all wearing uniforms.\n\nT\n\nhey allow 30 Indians only after 500 Ukrainians get in. To get to this border you need to walk 4 to 5 kilometers from the first checkpoint to the second one. Ukrainians are given taxis and buses to travel, all other nationalities have to walk. They were very racist to Indians and other nationalities,’” the 22-year-old from Mumbai told CNN.\n\nShe added that she witnessed violence from the guards to the students waiting at the Ukrainian side of the Shehyni-Medyka border.\n\nUkrainian men aged between 18 and 60 are no longer allowed to leave the country, but that decree does not extend to men who are foreign nationals.\n\nIjantkar says she saw Indian men were left in queues for long hours along with other non-Ukrainian nationalities.\n\n“They were very cruel. The second checkpoint was the worst. When they opened the gate for you to cross to the Ukrainian border, you stay between the Ukraine and Poland, the Ukrainian army don’t allow Indian men and boys to cross when you get there. They only allowed the Indian girls to get in. We had to literally cry and beg at their feet. After the Indian girls got in, the boys were beaten up. There was no reason for them to beat us with this cruelty,” Ijantkar said.\n\n“I saw an Egyptian man standing at the front with his hands on the rails, and because of that one guard pushed him with so much force and the man hit the fence, which is covered in spikes, and he lost consciousness,” she said.\n\n“We took him outside to give him CPR. They just didn’t care and they were beating the students, they didn’t give two hoots about us, only the Ukrainians,” she added.\n\nCNN contacted the Ukrainian army in light of the allegations of violence, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nFreezing conditions\n\nIjantkar said many of the students waited for at least a day, but she eventually turned back to Lviv because she was terrified, waiting in freezing temperatures with no food, water, or blankets.\n\n“I saw people shaking so terribly in the cold, they were collapsing because of hypothermia. Some have frostbite and blisters. We couldn’t get any help and (were) just standing for hours,” she said.\n\nAndriy Demchenko, a spokesman for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine told CNN Monday that allegations of segregation at the borders are untrue and that the guards are working under enormous pressure at the borders – but are working within the law.\n\n“From the day when (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has made an attack on Ukraine, the influx of people trying to leave Ukraine and the war zone has increased tremendously. If earlier, people trying to cross the border into the European Union and back amounted up to 50,000 (people) a day, now the amount doubled and continues to increase. There is huge pressure on checkpoints, on border guards.\n\n“In order to speed up the process and allow larger amounts of people to cross, the government has simplified the procedure of the border crossing as much as possible. Due to the increase in the volume of the individuals crossing, people have to stay in long queues. However, I can state that everything happens according to the law. There is absolutely no division by nation, citizenship, or class at the border,” Demchenko said.\n\nUkraine attracts many foreign students wanting to study medicine because it has a strong reputation for medical courses and tuition – and other expenses are much lower than in programs in other Western nations.\n\nAnother stranded student told CNN on Sunday that border staff on the Ukrainian side of the border were showing prejudice against foreign students.\n\n“They are depriving the foreigners. They are being very racist with us at the border. They tell us that Ukrainian citizens have to pass first while telling foreigners to stay back,” said Nneka Abigail, a 23-year-old medical student from Nigeria.\n\n“It’s very difficult at the moment for Nigerians and other foreigners to cross. The Ukrainian officials are allowing more Ukrainians to cross into Poland. For instance, around 200 to 300 Ukrainians can cross, and then only 10 foreigners or 5 will be allowed to cross… and the duration of time is too long. It’s really hard.. they push us, kick us, insult us,” Abigail said.\n\nAfricans have been sharing their experiences online using the hashtag #AfricansinUkraine.

They can’t just leave us like this. It’s so sad but we are used to the bad governance in Nigeria. It’s very sad.”\n\nOnyegbule acknowledged that there were Nigerian officials waiting to meet her and others once she crossed over into Poland.\n\n“It would have been so helpful in Ukraine, we were looking for someone to speak on our behalf there.”\n\nNigeria’s foreign affairs minister Geoffrey Onyeama said on Twitter that Ukrainian authorities had assured him that there were no restrictions on foreigners wanting to leave Ukraine.\n\n“Problem is the result of chaos on the border and checkpoints leading to them,” he stated, adding that he is “personally coordinating with our missions in Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Romania and Hungary to ensure we get our citizens out of Ukraine and bring back to Nigeria those ready to return while supporting those who are remaining in Ukraine.”\n\nSmoke billows over the town of Vasylkiv just outside Kyiv on February 27, 2022, after overnight Russian strikes hit an oil depot.

But putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, is a line that the US and other Western allies have not been willing to cross.\n\nSoldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division wait in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, before deploying to Europe on February 14. Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that the Biden administration “has made clear” the US will not “put boots on the ground.”\n\n“We’re not going to put American troops in danger,” she said.\n\nBut what other factors are keeping US troops out of Ukraine? Here’s what you need to know:\n\nWhy won’t the US send troops into Ukraine?\n\nThough the US has condemned Russia’s actions at every chance, President Joe Biden has gone to great lengths to make clear that US forces will not enter Ukraine and engage Russia directly.\n\nWhy’s that? As Biden told NBC News earlier this month, “That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.” In other words, the US’ entrance into the conflict has the potential to touch off a global war.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a national security and military analyst for CNN, told What Matters on Sunday, “The key to diplomacy is to limit the potential for war. While the current war of Russian illegal invasion into Ukraine is tragic, chaotic and devastating, it is still a regional conflict.”\n\n“If NATO or the US sent troops into Ukraine to help them fight the Russians, the dynamic would shift to a multinational conflict with potential global implications due to the nuclear power status of both US and Russia. Because of that, the US and NATO — and other nations around the world — are attempting to influence the success of Ukraine and the defeat of Russia by providing other types of support,” Hertling said.\n\nWhat about the US troops in Europe?\n\nThe US has deployed thousands of troops throughout Europe, both before and during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCNN’s Barbara Starr reported Sunday that more than 4,000 US Army troops who deployed to Europe on a temporary basis will now have their tour of duty extended – most likely for several weeks – as part of the US effort to reassure east European allies during the current crisis.\n\nBut those troops are not there to fight the Russians.\n\nUS forces “are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said from the White House Thursday.\n\nRather, US troops are tasked with defending “our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” Biden added.\n\nIs there any scenario where the US would engage Russia directly?\n\nUkraine borders the NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Russia threatened one of these countries, the US – along with France, Germany, the UK and the rest of the 30-member NATO alliance – would be required by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to respond.\n\nArticle 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation. The first and only time it has been invoked was in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US; as a result, NATO allies joined the invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nWill American troops help create a no-fly zone in Ukraine?\n\nThe United States will not put US pilots in the air to create a no-fly zone in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday.\n\nThe Biden administration’s posture of keeping US forces out of Ukraine means “we’re not going to put American troops in the air as well, but we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves,” she said.\n\nWhile some Ukrainian officials have called on NATO countries to “close the sky” over Ukraine, establishing a no-fly zone would put the US in direct engagement with the Russian military which the White House has made clear it is not interested in doing.\n\nHow else is the US helping Ukraine?\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday he has authorized $350 million in new US military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n“Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,” the top US diplomat said in a statement.\n\nPrevious drawdowns have been for $60 million and $250 million, putting the total over the last year at more than a billion dollars, according to an administration official.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken announced Sunday that the US is sending nearly $54 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to assist those affected by Russia’s invasion.\n\nHow has the US punished Russia?\n\nIn a word, sanctions.\n\nThe US and Western countries have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting its banking, aerospace and technology sectors. These sanctions enact penalties across industries, including:\n\nAsset freezes for the largest banks\n\nDebt and equity restrictions on critical mining, transportation and logistics firms\n\nA large-scale effort to shut down access to critical technology for key Russian military and industrial sectors\n\nOn Friday, the US – along with the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada – announced it would impose sanctions directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the US and the European Commission, along with France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada, announced they would expel certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\n“Sanctions, blockades, economic influence, building of alliances against Putin’s actions while simultaneously supplying Ukraine with weapons and other aide will hopefully prevent escalations and unintended worldwide consequences,” Hertling said.\n\nWhere does public opinion sit?\n\nAs we wrote about last week, Americans are wary of US intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to polls taken in the run-up to Russia’s invasion.\n\nIn an AP-NORC poll, just 26% of Americans believed the US should play a major role in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. About half, 52%, said it should play a minor role and another 20% that it should play no role at all.\n\nOne-third of Democrats (32%) and 22% of Republicans wanted the US to play a major role. Independents were most likely to say the US should play no role; 32% felt that way, compared with 22% among Republicans and 14% among Democrats.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThomas-Greenfield said Sunday that the US has “not taken anything off the table” when asked about targeting the Russian energy sector with sanctions, which so far has not happened.\n\n“We’re ramping up as the Russians ramp up, so there’s more to come,” she told Bash.\n\nUS and European officials have discussed targeting the Russian Central Bank with sanctions, a step without precedent for an economy of Russia’s size. Thomas-Greenfield did not give precise timing for that but said, “This is happening very, very quickly.”\n\nThe scale of the central bank sanctions are still under discussion and could have even more bite than officials have telegraphed, CNN’s Phil Mattingly has reported.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Sunday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/russia-nuclear-weapons-threat-what-matters/index.html", "title": "What to make of Russia's escalating nuclear weapons rhetoric ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe world rejected sham referendums Russia used to justify annexing four Ukrainian regions, and its military has been beaten back from key parts of the areas.\n\nBut Russia now views the areas as “inalienable parts of the Russian Federation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday.\n\nPaired with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion last month that Russia is ready to use its nuclear arsenal to protect its territory, it seems Russia now believes the sphere protected by its nuclear weapons includes these parts of Ukraine.\n\nBack when Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Texas A&M University professor Matthew Fuhrmann told me the likelihood of Putin actually using a nuclear weapon was low. Along with Todd Sechser, Fuhrmann wrote the 2017 book, “Nuclear Weapons and Coercive Diplomacy.”\n\nI called Fuhrmann to ask if this new rhetoric has changed things, if Putin is rational and to get a better sense of what we know about the so-called tactical nuclear weapons Russia could theoretically use. Our conversation, edited for length, is below.\n\nWhat has changed since the war began?\n\nWOLF: How have the last six months changed your impression of the worldwide nuclear threat?\n\nFUHRMANN: Certainly in the last few weeks and months, we’ve seen Russia continuing to try and play the nuclear card as a way to gain leverage over the West and especially the United States. The continued insertion of nuclear threats into the crisis has made me and others think more about the possibility of nuclear escalation.\n\nMembers of a local electoral commission count ballots at a polling station in Crimea on September 27 following a referendum on the joining of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to Russia. Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters\n\nOn top of that, we’ve seen Russia resort to other policies, like conscripting additional forces and openly targeting civilians in Ukraine, that raise questions about other things it might be willing to do down the road should things escalate further. So we’re in an environment now where a lot of people are very much thinking about the nuclear dimension here.\n\nBiden thinks Putin is ‘rational.’ Using a nuke would be irrational\n\nWOLF: President Joe Biden recently described Putin as a “rational actor” who miscalculated, but I think there’s something irrational about even threatening the use of nuclear weapons. What did you make of what Biden said? And do you think that Putin right now is acting rationally?\n\nFUHRMANN: I do think he’s a rational actor. A rational actor just means you’re making decisions based on a calculation of costs and benefits.\n\nSo someone can be rational and make decisions that we think are risky or problematic. But as long as they’re making those decisions on the basis of some means and calculation, factoring in costs and benefits, then I would still characterize them as a rational actor.\n\nHow could Putin possibly benefit from a nuclear strike?\n\nWOLF: There’s been a lot of skepticism that Putin would actually cross the line and use some kind of nuclear weapon. He would need to frame it as a defensive measure or as a response to a strike on the Russian homeland. Is there anything specifically with regard to that idea of a cost/benefit analysis that suggests it would be worth it for him to use nuclear weapons?\n\nFUHRMANN: I think the probability of Russia using nuclear weapons right now is still relatively low. I might put it slightly higher than I would have in late February, when the when the conflict was first picking up, but I still think it’s relatively low.\n\nThe reason is that you have to think about what Putin would gain from using nuclear weapons as well as what the cost would be. And the costs are potentially enormous.\n\nWhat we’re probably talking about here would be the use of a tactical nuclear weapon – something with a lower yield, that will result in fewer casualties, less radioactive contamination compared to a larger strategic weapon.\n\nEven still, the cost will be tremendous. And the benefits of doing so for Putin are also not totally clear.\n\nIf he wants to occupy Ukraine, it doesn’t make much sense to destroy territory that he wants to claim for Russia.\n\nThe likelihood he would do so is still relatively low, but it’s not zero.\n\nRussian soldiers walk to Red Square during a rehearsal on May 7 for a military parade marking the 77th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nA nuclear message\n\nWOLF: What are potential scenarios?\n\nFUHRMANN: More than using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield, what he might be more likely to do would be some kind of nuclear detonation in the middle of nowhere as a signal to tell the United States and the West, hey, back off. If there was going to be nuclear weapon use, that’s the scenario where I think it would be most likely based on the way things have gone so far.\n\nTactical vs. strategic\n\nWOLF: You just made a distinction between a tactical nuclear weapon and a strategic nuclear weapon. It seems like you’re crossing a line no matter what kind of nuclear weapon you use.\n\nFURHMANN: You’re definitely crossing a line no matter what kind of nuclear weapon you use. That’s true.\n\nBut it’s also true that there’s huge variation in terms of the kinds of nuclear weapons and the damage that they can inflict, and I think that that variation is important.\n\nA larger strategic warhead like the ones the United States uses on intercontinental ballistic missiles – if it’s detonated in a big city – that can kill 100,000 people or more. That is different than a smaller tactical nuclear weapon that if it was targeted in a populated area could kill maybe a few thousand.\n\nBoth events would, of course, be terrible and catastrophic. But I think there is a distinction between those two kinds of things.\n\nHow would a tactical nuclear weapon ruin the environment?\n\nWOLF: What would be the lasting environmental effect of even a tactical nuclear weapon? How long before people could go back and live in an area where one was used?\n\nFUHRMANN: That would depend on a lot of factors. It would depend on the size of the warhead. It would depend on how far above the ground it was detonated.\n\nIf it was detonated right at ground level, that means something different than if it’s detonated a mile in the air. It would also depend on things like wind patterns.\n\nSo it’s difficult to make a blanket statement about what the effects would be. In general, yes, you would have to worry about the radioactive contamination of an area anytime a nuclear weapon was used. How bad it would be would be a function of those variables.\n\nVehicles drive past advertising boards, including panels displaying pro-Russian slogans, in Luhansk, Ukraine, on September 20. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nWhat do we know about Russia’s tactical nuclear stockpile?\n\nWOLF: It’s my understanding that some tactical nuclear weapons can be very small and essentially deployed by an individual soldier.\n\nFUHRMANN: We don’t know nearly as much about Russia’s tactical nuclear forces and what they have as we do about Russia’s strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nThat’s in part because a lot of the prominent arms control treaties that were concluded between the United States and Russia dealt with strategic nuclear weapons. Through those negotiations and treaties, we learned something about the stockpiles that each country possesses as far as strategic warheads go.\n\nBut there’s been no comparable bilateral arms control dealing with tactical nuclear weapons. They do likely possess a range of different tactical nuclear weapons with different capabilities. It depends on the command and control procedures that are in place, but tactical nuclear weapons in general are much more portable than a strategic nuclear weapon. They’re designed for use on the battlefield and so they can be fired by a single soldier.\n\nWhat are the signs Putin would be gearing up to use a nuclear weapon?\n\nWOLF: What would be a tell that Russians were going to get ready to use one of these? Would they fortify themselves in a specific way or clear out of an area?\n\nFUHRMANN: Tactical nuclear weapons, to my knowledge, are not presently deployed. If Russia was going to do this, it would probably want to do it in a way that was visible to the United States through satellite imagery and other means.\n\nYou could see, for example, weapons moving out of storage, and weapons moving to the frontlines. These are things that would be observable, in theory, by US satellites. And to my knowledge, we haven’t seen any of that happening yet.\n\nWhy don’t treaties cover tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nWOLF: It seems strange, that we kind of dealt with the mutually assured destruction weapons (strategic nuclear weapons), but then there’s this whole subgroup (tactical nuclear weapons) that’s floating out there that countries don’t have a lot of knowledge about.\n\nFUHRMANN: The emphasis was on the strategic weapons because these were the big weapons that could destroy cities. I think it was natural to focus attention on those as being potentially the most destructive and therefore the biggest threat.\n\nBut yes, tactical nuclear weapons are still very significant. And it would be useful to think about arms control in that context as well.\n\nWhat is the US stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nWOLF: Does the US still maintain tactical nuclear weapons? And what should people know about the American stockpile?\n\nFUHRMANN: During the Cold War, the United States had a fairly large stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons. … It was believed that the only way to defend NATO in Europe from a Soviet attack was to have tactical nuclear weapons deployed that could be used, should Soviet troops try to advance into Western Europe.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended and the Soviet threat was dissipated, most of these weapons were dismantled or returned home. There are still some US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Not many. And they’re weapons that are militarily not all that useful. Compared to Russia, the United States has at this point, fewer tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nWill the US now reconsider its own tactical nuclear arsenal?\n\nWOLF: Will this current situation lead the US and NATO to rethink whether they should have more access to tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nFUHRMANN: I think probably some people in Washington are already thinking that the United States should be more equipped with a greater number of smaller-yield tactical weapons.\n\nEven before Russia invaded Ukraine, there were debates in Washington about whether the US should develop lower-yield weapons. It was feared that if Russia used one of the lower-yield tactical nuclear weapons that it possesses, the United States doesn’t have anything comparable. So if it were going to retaliate, in a nuclear sense, it would have to use a bigger nuclear weapon, which could be seen as an asymmetric response.\n\nThere were some generally more hawkish commentators and policy analysts who, even before the Ukraine war, were pushing the United States to develop these lower-yield nuclear weapons. And ironically those arguments will gain weight if Russia continues to make nuclear threats.\n\nShould Russia’s posturing lead to an increase in the US arsenal?\n\nWOLF: Do you have a position on that? What do you think should happen?\n\nFUHRMANN: My feeling is that nuclear weapons are useful as invasion insurance and as a deterrent against very major threats to national security. I don’t see them as terribly useful for blackmail or for other forms of political coercion.\n\nWith that view, the reason you would need a tactical nuclear weapon, low-yield, would be for battlefield use. I think that that opens a really dangerous precedent to start thinking about weapons that you’re going to use on the battlefield.\n\nI think about nuclear weapons as a weapon of last resort that you would use to stave off an invasion or full occupation of your territory, not something you’re going to use on a battlefield in a nonexistential type situation.\n\nAre these stockpiles secure?\n\nWOLF: I remember after 9/11, there was a lot of concern that the Russian stockpile in particular could be infiltrated or that we could see one of these tactical weapons used as a dirty bomb. Has that threat receded, or are we just not paying attention to it right now?\n\nFUHRMANN: In general, one problem with tactical nuclear weapons is that it is harder to secure them because they’re smaller. We know that there were some tense moments and in the US history with nuclear weapons in terms of worrying about its tactical forces falling into the wrong hands. Anytime there’s a lot of political instability in an area where nuclear weapons are stored, there are always concerns about them potentially falling into the wrong hands.\n\nIn the United States there are security measures in place and safety measures that make it more difficult to use a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhat exactly Russia has as far as those safety and security procedures in place, I’m not sure. But one would hope that they have something along the lines of what the United States has in that regard. That could make it more difficult for someone who can actually fire any tactical nuclear weapon, even if they could hypothetically get their hands on it.\n\nThe US can have an effect on the threat from Putin\n\nWOLF: What else should we know?\n\nFUHRMANN: A lot of people understandably want to know: Are nuclear weapons going to be used or could they be used by Putin in this conflict?\n\nThe United States, through its actions, influences that probability to a large degree. To the extent that the United States were to escalate its military involvement in the war, do anything to strike targets in Russia itself, do anything to put troops on the ground in an overt way and actually enter the conflict, all of those things would significantly increase the risk of nuclear escalation.\n\nHow should the US help Ukraine without tempting nuclear war?\n\nWOLF: At the same time, you’re starting to hear more and more lawmakers, in particular Republicans, questioning military aid to Ukraine at all. What is the right way to strike that balance?\n\nFUHRMANN: It’s a great question, and there’s no silver bullet answer, but you can look at history to get some guidance.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, there were many episodes where nuclear powers were indirectly involved in conflict with each other. You can think, for example, about the Soviet Union and their invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. And the war that persisted there over the next 10 years.\n\nThe United States was covertly providing a lot of support to the mujahedeen fighting against the Soviets. Not unlike the aid that has been provided to Ukraine now. The Soviet Union was, for its part, doing things to provide aid in the Korean War.\n\nThere’s a long history of nuclear powers indirectly fighting one another by providing aid to the country militarily engaged with a nuclear power. In none of those cases, so far, did it escalate to the nuclear level.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen again in the future, but I think there is a line that countries have been willing to walk up to – and that line appears to be providing covert support quietly to actors engaged in conflict with other nuclear powers but not openly entering the fray.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

It is from the closing scene of “Servant of the People,” a satirical TV show about a down-on-his-luck high-school teacher, played by Zelensky, who is thrust into the Ukrainian presidency after his rant about corruption goes viral.\n\nThe series didn’t just make Zelensky a star. It eventually served as the springboard for his real-life presidential campaign. In April 2019, within a month of the show’s finale, the comedian-turned politician was elected Ukraine’s president.\n\nZelensky again found himself in front of a lectern Friday, but the picture he outlined in the show’s final moments has never felt further away after Russian forces invaded Ukraine Thursday.\n\nThe battle for the capital, Kyiv, continued to rage Friday. Explosions lit up the sky as the Kremlin targeted the city with missile strikes before dawn, forcing people into air raid shelters.\n\nIn his Friday morning televised address, Zelensky was again a man in character, this time playing David to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Goliath. In a dark green tee shirt with dark circles under his eyes, the Ukrainian president struck a defiant tone and praised the country’s armed forces for “brilliantly defending the country.”\n\n“Now is an important moment,” Zelensky said. “The fate of our country is being decided.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv on Friday. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nZelensky has also been active on social media, using his Twitter account to post updates and reassure Ukrainians that he is staying in the country to lead the resistance.\n\nIn a video posted on Saturday morning titled “do not believe the fakes,” Zelensky revealed that he is still in Kyiv.\n\n“I am here. We are not putting down arms. We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this,” he said.\n\n“That is it. That’s all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine,” he added.\n\nZelensky has also turned down a US offer of evacuation from Kyiv, the Ukraine embassy in Britain said Saturday on Twitter.\n\n“The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US, according to the embassy.\n\n“Ukrainians are proud of their President,” the tweet adds.\n\n‘This gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis’\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began early Thursday. Moscow’s forces attacked by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions – and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for Ukraine and its capital.\n\nPutin framed the “military operation” as a necessary action after the United States and its allies crossed Russia’s “red lines” by expanding NATO eastward.\n\nZelensky on Friday again called for Putin to hold direct talks.\n\n“There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said in Russian.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia was ready to take part in talks in Minsk, according to reporting by Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. An adviser to Zelensky told CNN that Kyiv is considering the proposal.\n\nUkraine’s democratically elected government remains intact, but Putin has made it clear this week that he does not see Ukraine as a legitimate sovereign state. On Friday he called on Ukrainians to overthrow Zelensky themselves.\n\n“Take power into your own hands,” Putin said. “It looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement (with you) than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”\n\nPutin and his government have repeatedly put forward baseless and inaccurate claims that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “fascist” or “Nazi” regime. Zelensky is Jewish and had family members die in the Holocaust.\n\nPutin’s comments are unlikely to spur any sort of Ukrainian uprising. Many of Kyiv’s residents have left the city, and those that remain are unlikely to support him, considering Ukraine’s last pro-Russian leader was ousted in a popular uprising in 2014.\n\nZelensky was elected five years later, thrashing incumbent Petro Poroshenko, but his tenure has been rocky. The first several months of his term were engulfed by the quid-pro-quo scandal which saw former US President Donald Trump’s attempt to exert pressure on Ukraine to dig up dirt on election opponent and now-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nCovid-19 then tore through the country. Zelensky’s campaign promises, such as ending the war in eastern Ukraine and stamping out corruption, remain unfilled.\n\nBut the danger Zelensky faces is no longer just political.\n\nUS officials warned lawmakers that Russian forces who entered Ukraine through Belarus were about 20 miles away from Kyiv, sources told CNN.\n\nAnd intelligence officials in Washington are concerned the city could fall under Russian control within days. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Zelensky remains a “prime target for Russian aggression,” while Zelensky himself said Russia had marked him as their “number one target.”\n\n“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/politics/kevin-mccarthy-house-gop-ukraine-funding-blank-check/index.html", "title": "Inside the House GOP effort to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAfter House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Republicans might pull back funding for Ukraine next year if they take the majority, the GOP leader has worked behind the scenes to reassure national security leaders in his conference that he wasn’t planning to abandon Ukraine aid and was just calling for greater oversight of any federal dollars, sources told CNN.\n\nMcCarthy told key Republican national security committee members – some of whom reached out to McCarthy – that his comments that Ukraine wouldn’t get a “blank check” in a Republican majority were being taken out of context, the sources said. Rather, McCarthy told his members he was simply saying that a GOP-led House would not automatically rubber-stamp a request from the administration for additional Ukraine aid.\n\n“McCarthy was not saying, ‘We wouldn’t spend money.’ McCarthy was saying, ‘We’re gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend,’” one GOP lawmaker familiar with McCarthy’s thinking told CNN. “A ‘blank check’ means that people get whatever they ask for. What we’re saying is there’s going to be some thought, there’s going to be accountability, and taxpayer dollars are going to be used appropriately.”\n\nMcCarthy’s effort to soothe the House’s senior defense hawks, which has not been previously reported, underscores the fine line the aspiring speaker is walking on foreign policy as the war in Ukraine appears poised to grind into a second year. But it also offers a preview of the types of policy and political battles to come between the establishment and pro-Trump wings of the GOP, presenting a tricky balancing act — and potential headaches — for Republican leaders in a House majority.\n\nUkraine has led to messy politics for Democrats as well. On Monday, Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state abruptly withdrew a letter pushing the Biden administration to pursue diplomacy in Russia’s war with Ukraine, an about-face following furious internal backlash from Democrats.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liberal Democrats abruptly withdraw letter on Ukraine policy amid anger 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nGOP sources told CNN they believe that only a small faction of Republican lawmakers — the midterm elections will determine how many — are opposed to funding Ukraine’s battlefield efforts. What’s more likely to likely face cuts under a GOP majority, sources said, is the economic assistance and other non-military aid going to Ukraine, like the aid money going to the United Nations to help Ukraine rebuild its country and the money going to USAID to support Ukraine’s budget.\n\nIf Republicans win back the House, GOP sources say they are likely to ramp up overall oversight of the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine, such as examining end-use tracking of weapons. CNN has previously reported that the Biden administration doesn’t have perfect visibility into how or where US-provided weapons are used once they cross the border into Ukraine.\n\n‘Listening to Russian disinformation’\n\nStill, senior congressional Republicans who support robustly funding Ukraine’s war are watching warily as some more isolationist-minded colleagues have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks that they will heavily scrutinize – if not outright oppose – US money for Ukraine.\n\nFifty-seven Republicans in the House and 11 in the Senate voted against the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill in May. Some vocal GOP opponents like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas jumped on McCarthy’s recent comments to argue that a Republican majority should scale back aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe anti-aid crowd also has influential voices like Fox’s Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr. who have advocated for cutting off aid to Ukraine altogether.\n\n“They’re strong. Amongst Republicans, I call it the ‘Tucker Carlson’ effect,” the lawmaker said of House GOP skeptics. “I love Tucker on other issues, but he’s wrong on this. He’s listening to Russia disinformation. And he’s creating problems for us in our districts.”\n\nMcCarthy can’t afford to alienate or ignore the noisy skeptics in his conference who have raised concerns about indefinitely funding Ukraine’s war against Russia – whose votes he will need to become speaker, especially if Republicans win a narrow majority.\n\n“McCarthy cracked the door open here. He is leaning more towards our direction of pulling back. You also have Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham banging the drum on this,” said a source familiar with the ongoing discussions about Ukraine aid who favors tighter purse strings.\n\nA McCarthy spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n‘Bloated bureaucracy’\n\nLast week, McCarthy told Punchbowl News, “I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.”\n\nThe comments prompted frantic outreach on Capitol Hill from Ukrainians and European allies alike, sources told CNN, intensifying long-running concerns that a Republican majority in Congress threatens to hamper US support for Ukraine’s war against Russia.\n\nThey also led some GOP national security hawks to begin planning a campaign for after the midterm election to ensure that the US doesn’t abandon Ukraine. That includes preparing a combination of education for their new and skeptical colleagues as well as examining ways to increase oversight of where the money and weapons are going inside Ukraine.\n\nTo help convince skeptics, Republicans are looking to tap former Trump administration national security leaders as expert voices – rather than Biden administration officials. Some of the voices that Republicans are considering bringing in to speak to new members include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, sources said.\n\n“They need to hear from people they trust. The administration isn’t necessarily the best messenger for this,” said one GOP congressional aide.\n\nThey’re also planning to hold briefings from Republican think tanks with conservative bona fides like the Heritage Foundation, congressional trips to the region and direct engagement with Ukrainian and European officials as part of an education campaign.\n\n“I don’t think the issue is one of lack of support of aid from Ukraine. It’s a signaling that Republicans do things differently,” Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican in line to chair the House Intelligence Committee next year, said in an interview with CNN.\n\nTurner, who just returned from a bipartisan congressional meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, argued the bills that Democrats passed this year – such as a $40 billion aid package in May – included extraneous funding that he criticized as a “bloated bureaucracy,” such as money that went to the UN.\n\n“Kevin McCarthy supports providing weapons systems to Ukraine to continue to win on the battlefield,” Turner said in a roundtable with reporters on Monday.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman as seen on a US-provided HIMARS artillery piece on July 1, 2022 in Eastern Ukraine. Anastasia Vlasova/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nDespite confidence among GOP hawks that they have the upper hand over the caucus’ more isolationist wing, lawmakers are beginning to lay the groundwork to convince new members in particular that the military support is vital spending.\n\nCongressional Democrats on national security committees told CNN that McCarthy’s comments didn’t raise major alarm bells – yet – as they still believe there’s significant support for Ukraine among their Republican colleagues. One Democrat noted that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is a stalwart supporter of funding Ukraine’s war – and the Senate often gets its way in funding fights.\n\n“There’s the Reagan block and there’s the Trump block. And the Reagan block wants to help,” said another House Democrat who works on national security issues. McCarthy, the Democrat said, was “signaling that he’s going to have resistance and it’s not going to be easy.”\n\nThe ‘Three Mikes’\n\nIn the House, the pro-Ukraine effort is likely to be led by the “three Mikes” poised to become committee chairmen: Turner of Ohio on Intelligence, Mike McCaul of Texas on Foreign Affairs, and Mike Rogers of Alabama on Armed Services.\n\nFrom left, US Reps. Mike McCaul, Mike Turner and Mike Rogers CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAnother key voice will be Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a defense hawk who is expected to become House Appropriations chairwoman in a Republican majority.\n\nIf he becomes chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McCaul is considering holding his first hearing next year on Russian war crimes, according to one congressional source, to hammer home the egregiousness of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.\n\n“We’ve got to give them what they need. The Ukrainians, when we give them what they need, they win,” McCaul said on Bloomberg TV last week. “I do think you have broad bipartisan support for what’s happening in Ukraine, but I think you’ll see if we get the majority, more oversight and accountability in terms of the funding and where the money is going.”\n\nThe defense hawks are expected to make the case that the war with Russia goes beyond Europe. They argue that the US needs Ukraine to win in order to deter China from invading Taiwan, for instance. One senior Republican noted that Iranian drones now being used on the battlefield show how the war extends far beyond Ukraine’s borders.\n\nThe Ukrainians are also likely to make their own case directly to Congress. Ukrainian legislators and other top officials have held meetings with their American counterparts since the war began, telling US lawmakers that it is cheaper to invest in Ukrainian defense now than to defend Europe against wide-ranging Russian aggression later.\n\n‘Only for our country’\n\nUkraine skeptics both in Congress and on the campaign trail – along with influential outside voices – are preparing to ramp up their own campaign to try to curtail or outright stop the flow of US dollars to Ukraine.\n\nRepublican criticism of funding Ukraine has largely focused on the high costs of prolonging the war, as well as concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the need to devote more resources to domestic challenges. Earlier this month, the House Freedom Caucus wrote to McCarthy urging him to stand up a special inspector general on US involvement in Ukraine.\n\nGreene, a far-right Georgia Republican, posted a video on Twitter last month saying, “There is a country’s border that he (Biden) cares about and it is not this country’s border, it is Ukraine’s border. I believe our American tax dollars need to be used only for our country while we have so many problems, security crises.”\n\nAfter McCarthy’s comments last week, Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who is seeking a House leadership post next year, tweeted, “A Republican-led House will put the needs of America first. We cannot continue with unlimited spending for any foreign nation while our people are struggling to get by here at home.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep Jim Banks of Indiana, at a press conference in June 2022. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Senate GOP conference could also soon have new members who have been vocal opposing the aid, such as J.D. Vance, the Senate GOP nominee in Ohio. “I think we’re at the point where we’ve given enough money in Ukraine, I really do,” Vance told local Ohio television station 13abc last month.\n\nBut McConnell also weighed in last week with a statement urging the Biden administration and US allies to “be quicker and more proactive to get Ukraine the aid they need” – comments that were in stark contrast to McCarthy’s statement and a sign that McConnell expects Senate Republicans to continue to support Ukraine’s war.\n\nDan Caldwell, vice president of foreign policy at Stand Together, a conservative non-profit that opposes open-ended spending in Ukraine, said those advocating for scaling back support to Ukraine are also gearing up to make their voices heard with new members in what’s expected to be a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n“During the first few weeks of the new Congress, new members will have a lot of people trying to convince them to not keep their campaign promises to oppose interventionist policies in Ukraine,” Caldwell said. “Our community will make the argument to these members that not only is pursuing a more realist approach to Ukraine good policy, it is also good politics – especially considering domestic economic challenges and more important foreign policy priorities in other parts of the world.”\n\nLame duck funding push\n\nThe looming fight over Ukraine aid could come even before Republicans take control of Congress next year, as the Biden administration is considering pushing through another major Ukrainian assistance package before the end of 2022, administration officials told CNN. So far this year, Congress has approved more than $65 billion in aid toward Ukraine. While the administration believes that Republicans are unlikely to completely curtail support for Ukraine, they see value in locking in support now before things could get more challenging.\n\n“End of the year funding in Washington is going to be the wild, wild West of spending, especially if Republicans win the House,” Turner told reporters Monday, adding that Republicans could oppose a bill with extraneous items attached.\n\nRegardless of what it can get approved during the lame-duck session, the Biden administration will likely have to come back to Congress at some point next year to ask for money.\n\nWhile there is an acknowledgment that oversight will have to ramp up when reconstruction in Ukraine begins – which could be needed even before the war ends due to just how much help Ukraine will need – many congressional aides and administration officials believe that additional layers are not necessary at this time.\n\nEstonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur argued there already is clear accountability when it comes to weapons getting onto the battlefield.\n\n“I understand their position to have more accountability. I also have information from (Joint Chiefs Chairman) Gen. (Mark) Milley, who said to me that there is more of an accountability as ever, regarding the help sent to Ukraine, because they even have a barcode system to track basically each shipment which was sent to Ukraine,” he said. “I believe this is exactly what also Republicans want to hear that yes, there is accountability.”", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Katie Bo Lillis Melanie Zanona", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/politics/zelensky-putin-ukraine-negotiations-war-cnntv/index.html", "title": "Zelensky: 'I'm ready for negotiations' with Putin, but if they fail, it ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that he’s “ready for negotiations” with Russian President Vladimir Putin but warned that if they fail “that would mean that this is a third World War.”\n\n“I’m ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,” he told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria.\n\n“I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War,” he added.\n\nZelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks “without delay,” warning that otherwise Russia’s losses would be “huge.”\n\n“We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace,” he said. “And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It’s time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine.”\n\nZelensky has previously said that his priorities in the talks are clear: “The end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country.”\n\nZelensky also told Zakaria on Sunday that if Ukraine “were a NATO member, a war wouldn’t have started.”\n\n“I’d like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people. If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately. Because people are dying on a daily basis,” he said, while also adding that he was grateful for the aid NATO has provided since the invasion began.\n\nStill, last week, Zelensky dropped his clearest hint yet that he does not expect his country to join NATO anytime soon, something that has been a Ukrainian goal.\n\nNATO, a security alliance currently made up of 30 North American and European nations, was created in 1949 in response to the start of the Cold War. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet satellite states and three former Soviet republics have joined NATO, meaning Russia now shares a land border with the world’s largest military alliance.\n\n‘We are trying to defend our sovereignty’\n\nAsked how he is holding up amid the war, Zelensky told CNN that he was “doing just everything that everyone else in Ukraine is doing.”\n\n“We have made up our team to defend our country, so it seems to me that the person does not need to turn into anyone else. That is important when you can be just yourself,” he said. “So I am holding up quite well,” he added.\n\nZelensky also admitted that as of now his weakest point is losing people and children in these “huge numbers.”\n\n“I go to sleep with this information about children who were killed and we are continuing to pray in order to prevent new losses of people, but so far we haven’t attained these results,” he said, adding that “we are trying to defend our sovereignty, defend our country.”\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that since the start of the war, 11 girls and 25 boys have been killed.\n\nAsked about Putin’s claims that the Ukrainian government is full of neo-Nazis, Zelensky told Zakaria that it shows that the Russian President “might be capable of very horrendous steps.”\n\n“I’m not afraid of anything except for people, but the fact – the fact is that if he is serious about this statement, he might be capable of very horrendous steps because that would mean that this is not a game for him,” Zelensky said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction and background.", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}]}

I’m told their agenda is to write it off as an accident and throw it to the civil courts.”\n\n“I dismissed the sabotage claim initially. But not know (sic). I hope these NM have the sense to follow it through,” Baldwin continued, telling Matt Hutchins that his attorneys presented “certain anomalies” from the day of the shooting.\n\nEarlier this month, Baldwin filed a lawsuit in California against several individuals associated with the “Rust” film, according to a cross-complaint obtained by CNN.\n\nBaldwin told Matt Hutchins in another text, “the gun WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE FIRED in that camera angle. It was an angle on the gun being drawn and … cut. That set up did not call for the gun to shoot AT ALL. I told him that Halyna and I had something important in common. We both believed the gun was empty.”\n\nIn another message, sent two days after the shooting, Baldwin sent a message to his assistant saying, “I have to delete my archive.”\n\nThe report adds: “There is no further details on the meaning of this message.”\n\n“The email is irrelevant to this matter,” Baldwin attorney Luke Nikas told CNN. “Mr. Baldwin was referring to his Twitter archive, which he has long considered deleting. He fully preserved all records related to ‘Rust’ and turned them over to the authorities nearly a year ago.”\n\nIn one investigative report released Friday, a detective described Baldwin as cooperative in the chaotic moments after the fatal shooting.

Gordon Liddy (Shea Whigham); and Watergate security guard Frank Wills (Patrick R. Walker), who tipped off authorities to the break-in. June marks Watergate's 50th anniversary.\n\nReview:In 'Gaslit,' Julia Roberts and Sean Penn treat Watergate as a farce\n\nPickering remembers being \"obsessed with Nixon and the culture around\" the disgraced former president as early as age 11. Nixon served from 1969 until he resigned in 1974, two years after a break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee at Washington's Watergate complex orchestrated by Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President. Pickering envisioned a show about the culture \"of complicity and corruption and all that stuff which keeps recycling itself” created by the 37th president.\n\nIn 2017, Slate’s “Slow Burn: Watergate” podcast became the inspiration for the limited series.\n\nRoberts agreed to play Martha if Penn could play her husband.\n\n\"I just thought (it) would be intriguing to Sean, and lo and behold, it was,\" Roberts says. \"He's great at portraying anything, but the idea of seeing him really inhabit and have this complete and total internal and external transformation into John Mitchell, it's pretty astonishing. To be up close to that every day was remarkable.\"\n\nThe former attorney general was 58 at the time of the scandal (Penn is 61) but Mitchell was balding and heavyset. A team incorporated 11 prosthetics in a transformation that took about 3½ hours each day, but Penn never complained to Roberts about the process.\n\n\"He never held my feet to the fire on that one,\" she says.\n\n(Penn was unavailable for an interview. Earlier this month, he appeared on Fox News' \"Hannity\" and said he arrived in Ukraine last November for a documentary about Ukraine and its actor-turned-wartime president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.)\n\n'Gaslit' premiere:Sean Penn, Julia Roberts, Patton Oswalt, more make a splash in NYC\n\n5 books not to miss:Marlon James’ ‘Moon Witch, Spider King,’ definitive Watergate history\n\n“Gaslit” seeks redemption for Martha Mitchell: Mitchell, an Arkansas native, was the first to go public with her belief that Nixon was linked to the Watergate scandal, but was the subject of a smear campaign that involved even her husband. Martha testified, as part of Democrats' civil suit in 1973: \"I have been at the mercy of the White House for four years, who have treated me abominably, half-crucified me, have sent lies out through the press and started rumors galore about me.\"\n\nRoberts finds truth in the headlines describing Martha as \"'outspoken, loud, bold, outrageous.' She's all those things, but she's also this housewife who loves her husband and gets thrust into this bigger-than-life scenario.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winner says she finds commonality with Martha.\n\n\"I can certainly relate to the idea that Martha lived in a time where she would often find herself in a room surrounded solely by men, and men of power,\" she says. \"There's a lot of things about Martha that I appreciate and that I understand. I'm from a small town (Smyrna, Georgia). I find myself in very wonderful and bewildering, extraordinary circumstances from time to time, and I found her really, deeply touching. When you see past the glamorous, outdoor version of Martha, I found her her to be a very touching character to play.\"\n\n\"Gaslit\" depicts a turbulent union for the pair, wed from 1957-73, that included physical abuse and betrayal.\n\n\"From the moment they met each other, they had this crazy attraction and this amour fou (a wild, mad romance) kind of relationship, this tempestuous, almost young love,\" Pickering says. \"They were so deeply in love, and that's what makes what happened between them so tragic. I think John Mitchell was in love with Martha till the day he died\" in 1988.\n\nRoberts and Penn's off-screen friendship streamlined the process of conveying their characters' relationship on-screen, she says, unlike actors who've only recently met.\n\n\"All the time and energy that you spend getting to know people, getting to understand people, trying to make people comfortable with you, trying to get people to understand where you're coming from, or how you work, or what you need from them, that's weeks and weeks of work that doesn't exist,\" Roberts says.\n\nSean Penn calls Russian invasion of Ukraine 'a brutal mistake' while filming documentary there\n\nFact check:False claim that Hillary Clinton was fired during Watergate resurfaces online\n\n\"Gaslit\" marks the second project for Roberts and Whigham, following Amazon's 2018 series \"Homecoming.\"\n\nIn the new series, Whigham is a scene-stealer as firecracker G. Gordon Liddy, who headed the break-in. Liddy, a former FBI agent, ran a background check on his wife, Frances Liddy. As an attorney, he fired a gun in a courtroom. Bob Woodward, in writing about Liddy's autobiography, \"Will,\" in 1980, said Liddy \"learned to hold his hand over a candle flame and watch without flinching as his flesh burned. 'Suffering. That was the key,' to achieving his goals, he writes.\" (\"Gaslit\" opens with Liddy holding his hand over a lit candle that he extinguishes with his palm.)\n\n\"I had to be on top of him at all times and be in his skin, because he could very easily cross over into caricature,\" Whigham says. \"He's a performer. He thinks he's the smartest guy in the room... I had to find what was honorable about him, what made him human.\"\n\nWhigham focused on Liddy's choice to not name his Watergate accomplices. Whigham also zeroed in on Liddy's love for his wife and their five children.\n\nReview:Showtime's 'The First Lady' wants to be as cool as Michelle Obama, but it's just confused\n\nWhigham says he was intrigued by the project because, like the 1976 Watergate film \"All the President's Men,\" it wasn't Nixon-focused: He's not even seen in early episodes. \"'Gaslit' wasn't so much the Dick Nixon of it all. It was really Martha cracking it open and all of the insanity that surrounded it.\"\n\nPickering likened Martha's story to those of Britney Spears and Janet Jackson, the subjects of recent documentaries.\n\n\"There are so many women who have been sidelined and mistreated,\" he says. \"It's not a trend as much as it is a reappraisal of our own history and what we've done to certain people at certain points in time. It's happening not just with women, but minority historical figures... It's really exciting to get to introduce (Martha) to people who don't know about her.\"\n\nCowboy up:Josh Brolin's 'Outer Range' continues TV's wild Western ride with 'Yellowstone,' '1883'\n\n'The Kardashians':Kim Kardashian says Ye's 'not really a part' of Hulu show; Kourtney dishes on drunk Vegas wedding", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/04/29/mrs-maisel-spider-man-more-spots-for-nyc-virtual-travel/3048283001/", "title": "Visit familiar scenes from 'Mrs. Maisel,' 'Spider-Man', more TV, films", "text": "New York City is empty right now, making it the most attractive place on earth to visit.

Today at street level is The Little Owl, a Mediterranean restaurant in the same space as the Central Perk café where Rachel works and Phoebe famously performs “Smelly Cat.” Additionally, the neighborhood is home to a number of well-known Off-Broadway theaters including the Lucille Lortel Theatre, where aspiring actor Joey performs in the show’s earlier seasons.\n\n'How I Met Your Mother'\n\nTed’s nine-season search for his wife includes stops at countless iconic NYC destinations. At ‘21’ Club, Marshall finds what he declares to be the best burger in NYC; Ted (unwittingly) first meets his wife on the Columbia University campus; additionally, the gang’s go-to watering hole, MacLaren’s, was inspired by McGee’s, a bar in Midtown Manhattan.\n\n'The Last O.G.'\n\nStarring Tracy Morgan and Tiffany Haddish, this comedy follows a Brooklynite’s reintroduction to the community where he grew up after serving 15 years in prison. Primarily filmed in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, the sitcom (which debuted a new season on April 7), features locations throughout the borough, including Prospect Park, Sheepshead Bay and Williamsburg.\n\n'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'\n\nThe story of Miriam “Midge” Maisel’s foray into the male-dominated stand-up comedy industry gives viewers a peek into 1950s Manhattan. Mrs. Maisel lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side while her pursuit of a career in comedy takes her to iconic clubs in the West Village, such as the Gaslight and Village Vanguard, where she watches new friend and comedy icon Lenny Bruce perform. In the most recent season, viewers get a feel for another borough, as Midge’s in-laws move to Forest Hills, Queens.\n\n'Seinfeld'\n\nContrary to Jerry and friends’ experiences on the show, nobody yells, “No soup for you!” at The Original Soupman on West 55th Street in Midtown. Meanwhile, at Morningside Heights’ Tom’s Restaurant (Monk’s Diner), the cast was known to enjoy all the great, no-fuss comfort food and 75-cent coffee their hearts desired. Finally, Gray’s Papaya’s hot dogs were declared by Kramer to be “better than filet mignon!”\n\n'Marriage Story'\n\nThe story of Charlie and Nicole’s marriage dissolving is split between New York and LA, with NYC locations including the pair’s shared apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and the theater company in Manhattan where both are employed. Other major scenes are shot in the Flatiron District, Times Square and the West Village.\n\n'When Harry Met Sally'\n\nSince its release 30 years ago, fans visiting New York City have asked “what Sally was having” at Katz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side, gone on double dates to Café Luxembourg on the Upper West Side and enjoyed Washington Square Park’s scenery, where Sally told Harry to “have a nice life” at the start of the film.\n\n'You’ve Got Mail'\n\nImportant locales in this unforgettable ’90s romance are Café Lalo on the Upper West Side, “The Most Famous Café in the City”; Zabar’s, the specialty food market where Joe saves Kathleen’s Thanksgiving; and the 91st Street Garden in Riverside Park, where the film memorably concludes.\n\n'Sex and the City'\n\nNew York City has often been said to be the series’ fifth main character, in addition to Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha. Notable moments across six seasons include retail therapy at Greenwich Village boutiques and Madison Avenue department stores, snacking on cupcakes at Magnolia Bakery, riding the Staten Island Ferry, romantic moments at the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge and one of the girls catching a foul ball (and a date) at a New York Yankees game.\n\n'Gossip Girl'\n\nOn Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Blair and company famously held lunch breaks on the steps at The Met Fifth Avenue before heading further uptown to Constance Billard and St. Jude schools, filmed at the Museum of the City of New York. Meanwhile, scenes at the home of Chuck Bass and the Van der Woodsen family were filmed at the Lotte New York Palace, a five-star hotel situated just five blocks north of Grand Central Terminal, where Serena makes her dramatic entrance to the show in season 1.\n\n'Girls'\n\nThe story begins at Murals on 54 restaurant in Manhattan, when the main character, Hannah, is told by her parents they will no longer financially support her. As the series unfolds, Hannah and her friends Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna navigate their early 20s in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. They frequently congregate and enjoy latte’s at Café Grumpy, which is a real coffee shop that is fictionally managed by Ray in the series.\n\n'The Avengers'\n\nThe film’s famous battle of New York included scenes across the City, with most of the action taking place in Midtown Manhattan. Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye first met the alien attackers in front of Grand Central Terminal, mere blocks from Stark Tower (based on the former Condé Nast Building). In the end, Hulk defeats Loki for good in front of the historic Chrysler Building, with Manhattan still standing, before Thor beams him back to Asgard from Central Park’s Bethesda Terrace.\n\n'Batman'\n\nThe masked hero that popularized the nickname “Gotham” for NYC has been portrayed in areas throughout the City for more than 80 years. With Wayne Enterprises headquartered at One Liberty Plaza, a block from the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, Batman defeats Bane in the final fight scene of the Dark Knight trilogy on the steps of the New York Stock Exchange, while the Queensboro, Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges play prominent roles in the film.\n\n'Spider-Man'\n\nHailing from Queens, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has made harrowing rescues all over NYC throughout the decades. In the 2002 Spider-Man film, Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, saves love interest Mary Jane from the Green Goblin in Times Square before defeating the villain on Roosevelt Island. Other high-flying fights in the franchise take place at the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.\n\n'Ghostbusters'\n\nIn addition, the functioning firehouse Hook & Ladder Company 8 (Ghostbusters headquarters), Spook Central (55 Central Park West) and The New York Public Library Stephen A.

Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/06/01/gaslight-anthem-59-sound-tour-setlist-bowery-ballroom-governors-ball/661658002/", "title": "Gaslight Anthem: 'The '59 Sound' tour hits Bowery Ballroom, Gov Ball", "text": "NEW YORK — \"Did you hear your favorite song one last time?\"\n\nThat line from the title track of the Gaslight Anthem's seminal 2008 record \"The '59 Sound\" echoed around the walls of the sold-out, jam-packed Bowery Ballroom on Thursday, the band's first tri-state area show in nearly three years.\n\nIt was sung along, with fever and passion, from a few hundred of their biggest fans. And it was asked openly, wondering what's next for a band whose future is glaringly unclear.\n\nIt was the third show on a tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of the New Brunswick, New Jersey band's 2008 record \"The '59 Sound,\" sandwiched between other sold out gigs at the legendary 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. and an appearance at the Governor's Ball Music Festival on Saturday at Randall's Island Park in New York City.\n\nAfter opening with a hodge-podge of songs from other albums, the lights went down and guitarist Alex Rosamilia began playing the familiar, turntable-mimicking guitar lick at the start of \"Great Expectations,\" the first track from \"The '59 Sound.\"\n\nAnd when the rest of the band came in? The crowd exploded, singing \"Mary, this station is playing every sad song\" and \"everybody leaves and why, why wouldn't you?\" so loud that even singer Brian Fallon, a Red Bank native, was drowned out.\n\nIn one particularly cool moment, Fallon and drummer Benny Horowitz tried to hold out a dramatic pause before the final chorus of \"Old White Lincoln.\" The crowd, sweaty and eager, didn't wait.\n\nThey started singing \"you and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos\" while the band stayed silent but laughing, eventually jumping in midway through the chorus.\n\nMEANWHILE: The Misfits hit and miss at New Jersey homecoming show\n\nThe 25-song setlist left room for the band to pick through selections of their catalog, wisely focusing on selections from the earliest days of the Gaslight Anthem. Among the highlights were songs from \"Sink or Swim,\" the Gaslight Anthem's 2006 debut LP, including \"Wooderson\" and closing the set with \"We're Getting a Divorce. You Keep the Diner,\" and its rocking outro of \"stay hungry, stay free and do the best you can.\"\n\nAnd during \"Blue Jeans & White T-Shirts,\" a softer ballad from the 2008 EP \"Señor and the Queen,\" the crowd cheered when Fallon sang that \"someday I'll buy you that house on Cookman,\" referring to Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park.\n\nCheck out the entire The Gaslight Anthem setlist at the bottom of the page!\n\nThere were also two songs from the band's last album, 2014's \"Get Hurt,\" though they were oddly placed in the set list: For example, the band chose to open with \"Stay Vicious,\" the album's first track, on a tour marketed around a 10-year-old record.\n\nWhile some fans sang along, it was largely a three-minute letdown— though it was immediately forgotten after ripping through \"Handwritten,\" \"Diamond Church Street Choir\" and \"Boomboxes & Dictionaries\" in the aftermath.\n\nThere was some rust, as expected with a band that hasn't played in three years. A few of the oldest songs, for example, were performed noticeably slower, especially \"Boomboxes and Dictionaries.\"\n\nBut for the most part? It was a nostalgic return to the days when the Gaslight Anthem were the darlings of New Jersey and New York rock clubs and the beard-and-flannel, full-sleeve tattoo punks who fell in love with \"Sink or Swim\" and the band's regular sets at the Court Tavern in New Brunswick and the old Asbury Lanes.\n\n\"The '59 Sound\" turned them into superstars, peaking at no. 70 on the Billboard 200 and appearing on numerous 2008 \"best of\" lists. Over the next two years, the Gaslight Anthem would go on to headline Radio City Music Hall and play huge slots on the European festival circuit, which featured the first of many drop-ins from Bruce Springsteen.\n\n\"(The '59 Sound) is where everything started from, and it's something we feel collectively passionate about,\" Fallon said on a recent episode of the Fan Theory podcast.\n\nFLASHBACK: Remember that time the Gaslight Anthem played at PNC Bank Arts Center?\n\nThe atmosphere at the Bowery Ballroom — its 575-person capacity makes it likely the smallest show the band has played in years — contributed to the throwback atmosphere, barring one major change: The price of admission.\n\nTickets for the Bowery Ballroom show were among the hottest in town, with scalpers charging upwards of $250 for a ticket with a $50 face value.\n\n\"How'd you all get in here,\" Fallon asked the crowd. \"We know you didn't just get these tickets that easily.\"\n\nBut while there was an \"insider\" feel to the show, that didn't hang over the crowd. It was largely made up of seemingly longtime fans, just as excited for a song from the 2008 EP \"Señor and the Queen\" as they were for a track from \"Handwritten.\"\n\nThere were pockets of newbies and casual fans who had likely first heard the band on a festival stage or \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and weren't prepared for the wild, rollicking atmosphere of what was still undeniably a punk rock show.\n\nREVIEW: The Gaslight Anthem's Brian Fallon performs at hometown Count Basie Theatre\n\nAnd there were certainly a few guest-listed industry executives, tapping away on their cell phones up on the balcony while the hundreds of people below threw their arms around strangers for \"Here's Looking at You, Kid\" singalongs or jumping up and down during \"The Backseat.\"\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem has not announced what's next after \"The '59 Sound\" 10-year anniversary tour. In July, they will head to Europe for six shows before heading back to North America, with tour stops in Toronto and Chicago.\n\nConspicuously, the band is yet to announce a New Jersey show. And it's unlikely that new music will come anytime soon.\n\n\"When a band does a whole catalog of music ... who kind of, at a point, go, 'Alright, well that's pretty good, let's maybe leave it there,'\" Fallon said. \"But there's kind of, I don't know, like a ceremonial kind of beauty in that, like you can look at it and go, 'Oh, remember this?

Sesselmann’s victory over incumbent district administrator Jürgen Köpper, of the center-right Christian Democrat Party (CDU), “comes amid a broader rise of the AfD in national polls”, said Politico’s politics reporter Hans von der Burchard.\n\nAlice Weidel, the AfD’s national leader, told the Financial Times that the Sonneberg victory was a “milestone”. Winning “direct decision-making powers” would enable her party to “put a stop” to “the whole nightmare” of Sonneberg accepting refugees, Weidel said.\n\n‘Threats from outside and within’\n\nA survey last week by broadcaster ARD suggested that around 19% of voters would back the AfD in federal elections – putting the party ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, on 17%, and the other two members of the ruling coalition, the Greens (15%) and the Free Democratic Party (6%).

But, he added, “now the narrative is that this threat is also coming from within, through the transformation of society to climate neutrality – a central project of the centre-left coalition in Berlin and the Green Party”.\n\nSince the government unveiled plans to phase out gas- and oil-fired boilers and move to renewable heat pumps, discontent has “reached a new peak in Sonneberg and in many other towns and cities in Germany”, said the FT.\n\n“The cheek of it, it’s just unbelievable,” an AfD voter reportedly said. “I don’t need a new boiler, mine works very well, thank you, and they can’t force me to replace it.”\n\n‘Lack of trust in established parties’\n\nThe election result in Sonneberg has triggered a “frantic search for explanations” and a blame game between Germany’s other parties, said historian Katja Hoyer in The Spectator. That close to one in five people seem willing to vote for “a relatively new party which contains many far-right extremists shows their lack of trust in the established political spectrum”, she wrote, and “in its willingness to solve the big issues of the day”.\n\nThe “overall mood in Germany is increasingly grim”, said Ronald G. Asch, former chair of early modern history at the Iniversity of Freiburg. “However crude its rhetoric may be”, he wrote for The Critic, the AfD is good at “giving a voice to this discontent”.\n\nAnd the spread of such discontent means the German political system is likely to become “even more unstable over the next couple of years”, Asch added. German politicians may “learn the hard way that telling fairy tales to voters such as ‘the Euro and European integration policies will make you ever more prosperous’ will only take you so far”.", "authors": ["Jamie Timson"], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/961463/quiz-of-the-week-24-30-june", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 24 - 30 June | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

It’s paying a hefty price, not only with lives but destroyed schools, homes and bridges.\n\nOfficials estimate the total bill will be $10 billion. The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster.\n\n“We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Tuesday.\n\n“And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.”\n\nThe stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with.\n\nMaxar Technologies Maxar Technologies Gudpur, Pakistan Satellite image ©2022MaxarTechnologies\n\nThe United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/world/forest-loss-deforestation-fire-wri-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "Crucial tropical forests were destroyed at a rate of 10 soccer fields a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe area of tropical forest destroyed in 2021 was enough to cover the entire island of Cuba, and sent more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as India does in an entire year from burning fossil fuels, according to an analysis published Thursday.\n\nSome 11.1 million hectares (around 43,000 square miles) of forest was destroyed, predominantly by logging as well as fires, the analysis by the World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch and the University of Maryland found. Some of those fires were deliberately lit to clear land and many were exacerbated by climate change.\n\nTropical primary forest loss World Resources Institute\n\nThe loss was less severe than in 2020, but deforestation is still occurring at an alarming rate in the tropics. Of the area lost, 3.75 million hectares were primary tropical forest – sometimes called virgin rainforest – at the equivalent of 10 soccer fields every minute, WRI reported.\n\nPrimary tropical forests in particular are crucial for the ecological balance of the planet, providing oxygen that supports life and as biodiversity hotspots.\n\nThey are also rich in stored carbon, and when these forests are logged or burned, they release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. The destruction of primary tropical forest loss alone emitted 2.5 gigatons of CO2 last year, comparable to emissions from fossil fuel burning in India, which is the world’s third-biggest greenhouse gas emitter.\n\n“What’s important to understand is that forests, especially tropical forests, are part of the global climate system,” WRI senior fellow Frances Seymour told CNN. “So they’re not mechanical carbon storage devices, they actually influence the energy transfer and the moisture content of the atmosphere in ways that affect rainfall, that affect global circulation patterns.”\n\nFires are also playing an increasingly larger role in the tropical forest loss. Seymour said that there is a compounding effect between deforestation and climate change.\n\n“When deforestation happens, when forests are lost, it not only contributes carbon to the atmosphere, but also disrupts rainfall patterns and increases local temperatures in ways that, for example, make remaining forests more vulnerable to fire, and the warmer, drier conditions that come with climate change,” Seymour said.\n\nThe analysis looked primarily at tropical forests – which can be found in countries from Brazil to Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – because more than 96% of deforestation, or human-caused removal of forest cover, occurs there.\n\nThe findings were based on satellite imagery that assessed how tree cover changed over time. A loss of tree cover, or canopy, in the tropics often means forest has been destroyed. In other countries, where logging is less common, it can mean that the tops of trees are destroyed, such as in the case of fire, but the forest remains otherwise intact.\n\nNonetheless, Boreal forests – which are found in particularly cold climates, including in Russia, Canada and Alaska – experienced their highest loss of tree cover on record last year. More than 8 million hectares were lost, an increase of nearly a third from 2020.\n\nThat’s largely because Russia experienced particularly severe fires, losing 6.5 million hectares of tree cover.\n\nThese fires can cause what scientists call feedback loops, “in which increasing fires lead to more carbon emissions, which leads to hotter, drier weather, which leads to more fires, and so on,” the analysis says.\n\nIn the tropics, more than 40% of forest loss last year occurred in Brazil. Around 1.5 million hectares of forest in the country was wiped off the map, mostly from the Amazon. That’s more than three times the DRC, which lost the second-largest amount of forest.\n\nWorld Resources Institute\n\nIf Amazon reaches tipping point, climate goals ‘blown out of the water’\n\nIn Brazil, a major driver for deforestation is agricultural expansion, which increased by 9% between 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe WRI analysis warns that forest loss is pushing the Amazon toward a tipping point, where it will no longer be able to serve as one of the world’s most important carbon sinks and could even become a net emitter of CO2. The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, and it plays a crucial role in biodiversity, regulating the climate, and providing ecosystem services to millions of people who live there.\n\nIf that tipping point is passed, the world’s attempts to contain global warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – as laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement – would be “blown out of the water,” Seymour said.\n\nBrazil primary forest loss hotspots World Resources Institute\n\nAmid its sobering findings, the analysis gave some reason for optimism. Indonesia and Malaysia, which had for decades battled rampant deforestation, have both seen a reduction in the amount of tree cover it loses annually for five years in a row. In Indonesia, the amount of forest lost fell by 25% last year.\n\nThis is a sign that corporate commitments and government actions are working, according to Hidayah Hamzah, Forest and Peat Monitoring Senior Manager from WRI in Indonesia.\n\n“This indicates that corporate commitments and government actions are clearly working,” she told journalists at a briefing. “Indonesia is heading in the right direction to meet some of its climate commitments.”\n\nMalaysia, however, has already lost one-fifth of its primary tropical forest since 2001 and up to a third since the 1970s.\n\nHamzah added that the Indonesia’s success was due in part to the government’s moratorium on logging licenses for primary forests and peatland, as well as improved fire monitoring. A policy called NDPE – No Deforestation, No Peatland, No Exploitation – now covers more than 80% of palm oil refining capacity in Indonesia and Malaysia, which are the world’s biggest exporters of the oil, and over 80% of the pulp and paper industry in Indonesia.\n\nBut WRI warns too that as palm oil prices hit a 40-year high, these countries’ forests could come under increasing pressure. Indonesia also lifted a temporary freeze on new permits for palm oil plantations.\n\nWhile there was an overall reduction in tree cover loss last year, the annual improvement is not consistent enough to meet global commitments, including a declaration signed by more that 140 countries at climate talks in Glasgow last year to “halt and reverse forest loss by 2030.”\n\nSeymour also warned against relying too much on forests to offset greenhouse gas emissions, saying companies and countries should be using them to go above and beyond decarbonization efforts – by dramatically reducing fossil fuel use – or to offset emissions that are impossible to cut with current technology.\n\nThe airline industry is one example, as technology to fly carbon-free does not exist yet at scale.\n\n“So, yes, we want them to be reducing those emissions as quickly as possible and investing in new technologies that will allow flights without carbon, but in the meantime, they are ‘unabated’ emissions,” she said. “And compensating those with purchase of carbon credits can can provide a source of finance that we desperately need to incentivize the protection of the world’s forests.”", "authors": ["Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/americas/brazil-highway-approval-documents-intl/index.html", "title": "Documents show Brazil's environment chief approved paving ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGovernment documents show that the head of Brazil’s environmental agency overrode previous expert recommendations from his own organization, when he approved the construction of a controversial highway through the Amazon rainforest last week.\n\nLast week, Eduardo Bim, president of environmental agency IBAMA, authorized Brazil’s federal government to begin repaving highway BR-319 between the cities of Manaus, in Amazonas state, and Porto Velho, in neighboring Rondonia, a route which cuts through the most pristine area of the country’s Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe decision was immediately criticized by environmental groups who say that repaving the route would encourage deforestation.\n\nThe highway project was originally a key part of a plan by the country’s military dictatorship to develop the wild area and integrate it with the rest of the country. It was officially opened in 1976, but poor maintenance led to its abandonment by 1988. Since then, the road has been only partially usable.\n\nAs climate NGO Observatorio do Clima highlighted on Wednesday, the authorization also goes against earlier recommendations from a working group made up of other IBAMA officials, who warned that paving the highway would drive deforestation in the region.\n\nThe group also pointed out a link between some well-maintained parts of the road and higher levels of traffic, “occupation” and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nLogging in the city of Realidade in Amazonas state, near the BR-319. Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\n“Monitoring and inspection activities carried out by environmental agencies in the region have shown that the disorderly occupation process, associated with high rates of deforestation, has intensified over the last few months,” they wrote.\n\n“This is particularly notable at each end of the BR-319, where the asphalt is in good condition, traffic is heavy, and the development of the road has encouraged its occupation,” continues the document.\n\nThat document, published in 2008, also recommended ten “preconditions” for repaving the highway, including the creation of protected areas along the more than 400 km of road that is to be paved and the creation of ecotourism programs involving local communities.\n\n“It is impossible not to point out (these) additional recommendations to be considered as preconditions by the Federal Government” prior to the beginning of the works, it adds.\n\nObservatorio do Clima said that IBAMA’s experts issued similar recommendations this July, but the agency leadership ignored them as well.\n\nThe BR-319 highway near the border between Amazonas and Rondonia states. Raphael Alves for The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nCritics of the decision were quick to point out the timing of the decision, noting that Brazil is heading to new elections this fall where President Jair Bolsonaro is expected to face off against former President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nBim is an appointee of Bolsonaro, who made repaving the road a campaign promise in the run up to the 2018 election. Previous presidents have also promised to repave and fully reopen the highway, including Da Silva.\n\n“The decision is clearly politically motivated” and the project is cause for “great concern,” said Fernanda Meirelles, executive-secretary of BR-319 Observatory, an NGO set up to push for the sustainable development of the highway region.\n\nCNN has contacted IBAMA for comment but has not received a response.\n\nBrazil´s infrastructure minister Marcelo Sampaio celebrated the decision as a “result of the courage and technical work” in a post on Twitter.\n\n“We are going to take Amazonas society out of isolation,” he wrote, referring to Brazil’s Amazonas state.\n\nThough the new license effectively greenlights the repaving project from an environmental perspective, it does not include provisions for the 10 conservation measures recommended by officials in 2008.\n\nAccording to the terms of the license, inspections will be the only measure designed to limit the environmental impact of the road, which runs through a vast remote area in northwest Brazil.\n\n“Inspection operations are insufficient to curb land grabbing, invasions, deforestation and land speculation, pressures that have increased exponentially in recent years (in the zone),” Meirelles also said.\n\nCivil society organizations are planning to push for IBAMA’s decision to be canceled in the courts, according to Suely Araujo, a public policy expert at the NGO Climate Observatory.\n\n“The license does not even require the installation of inspection posts (along the road). There is no guarantee that deforestation in the region will be controlled once the road is built,” said Araujo in a statement.\n\n“As deforestation is the main negative impact associated with paving, the declaration of the viability of the work, which is inherent to all prior licenses, is not duly substantiated. It is a license that must be annulled by the courts,” she added.\n\nBrazil’s Amazon rainforest has been deforested by a record amount in the first half of 2022, according to the country’s Space Research Institute (INPE.)\n\nData from INPE satellites shows that 3,750 square kilometers (1,448 square miles) of the world´s largest rainforest were lost in Brazil between January 1 and June 24, the largest area since 2016, when the institute began this type of monitoring.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Pedroso Jack Guy", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Jack Guy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-deforestation-term-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Brazil: Deforestation is accelerating in Brazil as Bolsonaro's first term ...", "text": "Sao Paulo CNN —\n\nIllegal activity in the Amazon is gaining momentum as the last months of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration wind down, experts tell CNN.\n\nAccording to specialists and people on the ground, loggers, ranchers, miners and others seeking profit are tearing apart the protected region faster than ever, motivated by fears that Bolsonaro’s re-election bid could fail – and that the next president could crack down harder on such activity.\n\nFrom illegal miners openly declaring their support to an environmental minister’s resignation after investigations tying him to illegal log-smuggling, Bolsonaro administration is seen as an ally to environmental law-breakers in the Amazon.\n\n“The government seems to be letting people grab public lands. Trees are being knocked down and burnt in order to create grazing pastures. They just keep going. No one does anything about it,” says Marcelo Horta, a sociologist who works with indigenous peoples in Labrea, a town in Amazonas state.\n\nLuciana Gatti, a leading researcher at Brazil’s Space Research Institute (INPE), a government agency that tracks fires in the Amazon, theorizes that the country’s political calendar could be the reason.\n\n“If you are an environmental criminal, and you see there is a big chance that the one who is giving you the green light will leave, what would you think? Let me make the most out of this as it might be the last year of lawlessness”, said Gatti.\n\nA truck drives past a pile of illegally cut down logs in the forest in Humaita, southern Amazonas State, Brazil, on September 17, 2022. Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA perceived ally to land grabbers\n\nSince his 2018 electoral campaign, Bolsonaro has advocated against what he sees as excessive environmental legislation and protections that supposedly hinder activities such as agriculture and mining, including in indigenous protected territories.\n\nAlthough Bolsonaro has passed some laws to protect the environment, his administration has seen both Brazil’s Environment Ministry and environmental protection agency Ibama subjected to budget and staff cuts. Ibama’s practice of destroying confiscated equipment used in illegal mining and tree-chopping has also been publicly condemned by the president.\n\nThe President is also a keen supporter of a set of five draft bills going through Congress known by activists as the “destruction package.” These laws include proposals to give property titles to land grabbers, allow mining in indigenous lands and loosen environmental licensing. Although they have not been approved, Bolsonaro’s continuous defense of such issues is seen by NGOs and opposition politicians as an incentive to those on the ground.\n\nAs a result, the world´s largest rainforest has been registering record after record of deforestation. Between 2019 - when Bolsonaro took office - and 2021, Brazil lost over 33,800 square kilometers of rainforest in the Amazon according to INPE. That’s an area larger than Belgium, with an average of 11,000 square kilometers lost per year.\n\nIn this year to date, over 7,555 square kilometers have been deforested.\n\nBolsonaro will face leftist former President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva at the polls in October. Lula, as he is widely known, recently told CNN Brasil that in his government “there will be no Amazon deforestation.”\n\nDuring Lula’s presidency (2002-2010), deforestation shrank 65% in Brazil, according to INPE.\n\nA new culture\n\nIn the town of Labrea, it is increasingly common to see cowboy hats and Brazilian country music (sertanejo), symbols of the agribusiness culture in the country, says Horta.\n\n“It’s a whole culture taking over,” Horta told CNN. “This year we see more people voicing their support for president Bolsonaro, supporting the opening of roads and the extraction of wood.”\n\nLabrea is located in Amacro, an area defined by the Brazilian government in 2021 as a “special zone of sustainable development”. But on the ground, the Amazon forest is being pushed back by agriculture, cattle and logging activities, many of them illegal, say experts and federal workers who spoke to CNN.\n\nAccording to MapBiomas, an independent monitoring initiative, the Amacro region accounted for 12% of deforestation in the country in 2021.\n\nLabrea, which has a population of less than 50,000 in an area larger than West Virginia, has been on fire in recent weeks – literally. In the first 12 days of September, INPE satellites recorded 1,570 fires in the municipality – the second highest number in Brazil for the period.\n\nThe figure represented a 3,040% leap in comparison to the first 12 days of August, when only 50 fires spots had been detected.\n\nIt’s part of a wider trend being observed in the Amazon of late. Between August 2021 and July 2022, an area of 8,590 km2 – larger than the state of Delaware – was deforested in the Amazon, according to Inpe data.\n\nINPE data also shows that in August the Amazon biome recorded its worst number of fires for the month since 2010: 33,116 hotspots registered, an increase of nearly 30% compared to the same month in 2021. This year alone, over 96,000 hotspots were registered.\n\nFires are one of the stages in the illegal chain of occupation and exploitation of the Amazon region.\n\n“What we normally see in these areas is the use of fire before or, mostly, after trees have been brought down, so deforestation is completed”, says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of NGO Observatorio do Clima, to CNN.\n\n“A mass of forest lays on the floor, it dries up, and then fire is set to it. Sometimes two or three fires are needed in the same area so it gets properly cleared”.\n\nAerial view of a burning area in Lábrea, southern Amazonas State, Brazil, on September 17, 2022. Michael Dantas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBolsonaro is quick to downplay the phenomena of fire events. During an interview with Globo TV in August 22, he suggested the fires were caused by natural events or by traditional communities.\n\n“When we talk about the Amazon, why don’t we also talk about France, which is on fire?,” he said, referring to the wildfires that ravaged France this summer.\n\n“In Brazil, it is no different, it happens. Much of it is criminal, some are not criminal. It’s the riverside man who sets fire to his small property,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nFernando Oliveira, director of operations at the Justice and Public Security Ministry, oversees Guardiões do Bioma (Guardians of the Biome), a government task force in which security forces, environmental agencies and local firefighter teams cooperate to combat deforestation and fires in the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, among other duties.\n\n“Our focus is the fight of environmental crimes in an area that covers approximately 60% of national territory,” said Oliveira to CNN.\n\nTo monitor deforestation, the Guardiões operation has created just six bases spread across in this vast Amazon territory. In the state of Amazonas, which is as big as Mongolia, the operation relies on a single base.\n\nOliveira dismisses cattle farmers’ use of fire to clear land or any other human activity as causes of the hotspots in the rainforest.\n\n“Most fires happen in a natural way, you have high temperatures, low humidity, dry foliage, so any trigger such as cigarette butt can get the fire going,” he says.\n\nBut most experts disagree.\n\n“Decades of studies show that the Amazon doesn’t catch fire naturally. In 99% of the cases, the fires are provoked, there is someone who lit the match,” says Astrini.\n\n“Fires caused by natural events in the Amazon, a tropical forest, are a very rare event that may occur every 500 years. Practically all the fire we have in the Amazon is anthropic (manmade), and it is usually associated with deforestation and the clearing of pasture areas,” said Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of map analysis project MapBiomas, to CNN in August.\n\nA threat to the world’s climate\n\nDestruction of the Amazon poses a direct threat to the global climate.\n\n“When we deforest we are transforming [the Amazon[ into an accelerator of climate change because it starts releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, reducing rain and increasing temperatures in Brazil and the world,” Gatti, the INPE researcher, told CNN.\n\n“It is a calamity,” she added.\n\nBoth Gatti and Astrini believe that external pressure is key to deter the march of deforestation.\n\n“International trade is a driver of deforestation. If other countries stopped buying the fruits of this activity, destruction would halt,” says Gatti, who adds that there should be a global movement to stop buying wood from Brazil.\n\nIt has started to happen. The European Union has advanced a plan to require that products sold in the bloc must not come from deforested or degraded land. The new legislation establishes that companies selling in the EU have to verify items such as cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm-oil, soya and wood have not originated from such areas.\n\nBut on the ground, a cultural shift has already taken hold. Daniel Cangussu, a Brazil´s Indigenous Agency staffer who lives in Labrea, told CNN that on the ground there is no sign of a change in the “intense landgrabbing and deforestation” that he has witnessed under Bolsonaro’s presidency\n\n“It’s notorious (in the region), people talk openly about it.

His approval rating is at its lowest point, 41%, in an average of polls. His decline is clear even among core Democratic groups.\n\nThe good news for the President is the upcoming Supreme Court nomination fight likely can’t hurt and could help him gain ground with his base. For starters, it could help motivate them to vote in the 2022 midterm election, as nominations during former President Donald Trump’s administration taught us.\n\nYou can see Biden’s base problems in a recent Pew Research Center poll. His approval rating among Democrats was down to just 76%. Biden’s standing with independent-leaning Democrats was an even lower 56%. At his peak, in April 2021, his approval rating with each group was about 20 and 30 points higher respectively.\n\nWithin the Democratic base, Biden’s numbers have been sinking among younger voters and minorities. The Pew poll has him down to a 35% approval rating among 18-29 year-olds, even though that was his strongest age group in the 2020 election. Biden’s approval rating slipped to just 60% with Black adults, even as he won this group with about 90% of the vote in 2020, when he first pledged to nominate a Black woman to the court.\n\nBiden’s drop within his base comes after being unable to deliver so far on his Build Back Better agenda and federal voting rights legislation, as well as souring views of his handling of the economy and the coronavirus.\n\nThat’s why he needs to remind Democrats why they voted for him in the first place.\n\nNominating a liberal who would make history to the Supreme Court can do exactly that, even if it won’t change the ideological makeup of the court. Democrats have turned against the court with its 6-3 conservative majority. A recent Marquette University Law School poll has Democratic approval of the court down to 45%. It was 57% two months before the 2020 election.\n\nNow to be fair, a successful Supreme Court confirmation might not be enough to help Biden given voters’ views of the economy and the pandemic.\n\nOftentimes though, one event can get the ball rolling in politics. Biden’s decline in popularity started with Americans disliking how he handled the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in August. Few voters cared a lot about Afghanistan specifically during the withdrawal, but it started a cascading bad news train for Biden that continued with concerns over the coronavirus – with the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants – and the economy.\n\nBiden likely hopes a Supreme nomination and confirmation can do the opposite. Nominate someone popular to the court, see Covid-19 cases drop (as they are right now) and maybe Democrats return to backing Biden.\n\nTrump’s nominees\n\nWe already saw how a Supreme Court nomination fight can help a struggling president during the Trump administration.\n\nTrump’s first nominee for the court, now Justice Neil Gorsuch, was one of the most positively received actions Trump took during his first 100 days in office. His nomination and confirmation came during a time when Trump’s popularity fell steadily during most of those first 100 days.\n\nTrump’s popularity went up immediately after Gorsuch was confirmed. While we cannot prove that the confirmation of Gorsuch provided a temporary boost to Trump, it certainly didn’t hurt. In an average of polls, Trump’s net approval rating went from -12 points the day before confirmation to -7 points a month later. That may not seem like a lot, but remember Trump generally had one of the steadiest approval ratings on record and the little movement before this had been against him.\n\nTrump’s approval rating climb reversed itself after he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, which goes to show a Supreme Court nomination won’t necessarily help if the public holds other things against you.\n\nTrump’s next nomination fight to confirm now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh may have helped Republicans retain the Senate during the 2018 midterms.\n\nRepublicans would have lost the majority if they didn’t flip at least one Democratic-held seat. They ended up flipping four seats in states that Trump had won in 2016 (and later won again in 2020).\n\nRepublicans credited Kavanaugh’s contentious confirmation hearings and Democratic senators voting against him for shifting the Senate odds in their favor. Indeed, statistical models at the time showed in real time that Republicans’ chances of holding onto the Senate improved because they were picking up ground in red states where vulnerable Democratic incumbents were on defense.\n\nThe hearings also seemed to boost the chance of Republicans voting in the midterms. Likely voters became more Republican-leaning compared to all registered voters, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver.\n\nEnthusiasm is important because midterms have lower turnout than presidential elections, and Democrats have an enthusiasm problem right now.\n\nA recent NBC News poll found that Republicans are more than 10 points more likely to say they have high interest in the 2022 midterms than Democrats. This a major decline among Democrats from a few months ago, and a reversal from where we were at this point in the 2018 midterm cycle.\n\nSpecifically, the polling indicates that Black voters and younger Democrats have had some of the sharpest declines in interest. These are the usually Democratic-leaning groups where Biden’s approval has declined the most as well.\n\nThis isn’t a coincidence and should worry Democrats. If you examine the polling (e.g. Quinnipiac University), these groups still favor Democratic candidates for Congress by significant margins.\n\nBut if these voters don’t show up because they don’t like Biden, then it won’t matter that they still prefer Democratic congressional candidates to Republicans.\n\nAnd if Democrats lose even one Senate seat this November, it will severely limit Biden’s ability to nominate anyone else to the court during the rest of his first term in office should the opportunity come up.

He recently was appointed the Ted Turner Professor of Environmental Media at The George Washington University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn 1991, the small island nation of Vanuatu raised a question on the global stage that rich nations have been avoiding ever since: Who should pay for climate catastrophe?\n\nJohn Sutter Beth Mickalonis\n\nAt the time, Vanuatu – on behalf of an alliance of small-island states – argued quite reasonably that polluters should pay for the costs of their pollution.\n\nIt was an urgent question – with remarkable foresight. Vanuatu is in a low-lying archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, and its territory is threatened as global temperature increases contribute to rising sea levels worldwide.\n\nIndeed, entire nations could be lost if fossil fuel pollution continues unabated.\n\nThere should be an “insurance pool … used to compensate the most vulnerable small island and low-lying coastal developing countries for loss and damage resulting from sea level rise,” Vanuatu’s ambassador, Robert Van Lierop, proposed to United Nations climate negotiators, according to a 2019 article in the journal “Climate Policy.”\n\nMore than 30 years later, this issue of irreversible “loss and damage” from the climate crisis is set to be one of the central issues as diplomats and world leaders convene in Egypt for the COP27 climate negotiations.\n\nAfter decades of deflection, it’s overdue for high-polluting countries like the United States to take this question seriously. It’s clear that polluters should be held accountable for these losses to territory, culture, life and property.\n\nYes, it is also absolutely critical that the world abandons fossil fuels as quickly as possible. That is another central discussion point at COP27, and the world is well behind on its goal of holding warming to 1.5 or at most 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages. (We’re on track for about 2.7 degrees of warming, based on current policies; recent climate bills passed by the US Congress are a step forward, but are not enough).\n\nThe less carbon we put into the atmosphere, the less risk we put into the climate system — with important consequences for sea levels, storms, drought, biodiversity and so-on.\n\nStill, there can be no justice without action on loss and damages.\n\nArguments against action have taken many forms over the decades. The most laughable, in retrospect, is that this was a problem for the future rather than the present.\n\nWe now see clearly that the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather worldwide. Look no farther than the deadly floods in Pakistan this summer or Hurricane Ian in Florida this September. Disasters are getting more expensive because they’re becoming more intense as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and swamp the atmosphere with heat-trapping gasses.\n\nThat may feel like a new phenomenon, but it’s been decades in the making. Scientists linked a deadly 2003 heat wave in Europe, for example, to human-caused warming. That heat wave killed an estimated 20,000 people.\n\nThe onslaught of ever-worsening heat waves, droughts, wildfires and storms can feel both urgent and numbing. The truth is that as long as humans have been burning fossil fuels, we’ve been making the planet more dangerous.\n\nOther arguments against loss-and-damage payments should be seen plainly for what they are: excuses and stall tactics. The harm is undeniable at this point, as is the cause. Oxfam estimates these climate losses will total $1 trillion per year by 2050.\n\nWhat’s trickier is sorting out the mechanism for payment.\n\nThe UN’s Secretary General called in September for a tax on fossil fuel profits.\n\n“The fossil fuel industry is feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns,” António Guterres said.\n\n“I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices,” he added.\n\nArguments against action have taken many forms over the decades. The most laughable, in retrospect, is that this was a problem for the future rather than the present. John D. Sutter\n\nThe oil and gas industry has raked in $2.8 billion per day in profits over the last 50 years, according to a recent analysis. That includes more than $31.3 trillion in profit for fossil fuel companies between the year 2000 and 2019, according to a recent report, “The Cost of Delay,” released by the Loss and Damage Collaboration and supported by two dozen organizations.\n\nThat $31 trillion in profits is about 60 times what would have been needed to cover economic losses from climate disasters in the world’s most vulnerable countries over that same period, according to the report. Those profits should be seen as immoral given what we know — and have known for decades now — about the harm burning fossil fuels cases globally.\n\nLast year’s COP26 in Scotland resulted in promises to continue discussing the issue of “loss and damage” but there was no real action. Vanuatu and other vulnerable nations shouldn’t be put on hold for further years or decades. It’s clear that this bill is substantially overdue.\n\nShort of international efforts to fund a loss-and-damage process, countries and individuals are turning to the courts. A Peruvian farmer, for example, is suing a German fossil fuel company over a melting glacier that threatens his home and farm. The suit, filed in 2015, according to news reports, claims the German company, RWE, should be liable for its proportion of the damages, in line with the proportion of global fossil fuel pollution it has created. (RWE is contesting the lawsuit and says it should not be held responsible for the damage.)\n\nAnd in 2021, Tuvalu and other countries formed the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law. The aim is to explore claims in international courts.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter.

That can be done as part of UN climate negotiations.\n\nIt won’t fix the crisis, but it would help establish a sense of climate justice.\n\nThirty-one years is long enough to wait.", "authors": ["John D.
