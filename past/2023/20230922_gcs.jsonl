Here's why ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTeens are entering the chat around social media.\n\nAdults often stress about the anxiety, self-esteem issues and social comparisons that teenagers may encounter on social media, but a new study is asking teens what they are actually experiencing online and how they see it in their lives.\n\n“One of the things we really want to do with this larger work is bring teens’ own voices to the debate,” said the report’s lead author, Monica Anderson, associate director of research of the Pew Research Center’s internet and technology team. “This work really wants to shine light on: Teens are getting both positives from social media, but they’re also getting negative things as well.”\n\nResearchers with the Pew Research Center surveyed 1,316 teens across the United States ages 13 to 17 from mid-April to early May. The youths were asked about their thoughts, feelings and use of social media.\n\n“When it comes to new and emerging tech, teens are often at the vanguard of tech adoption,” Anderson said.\n\nOne theme of the survey’s results: Teens see their experience on social media as more positive than adults imagine it to be.\n\nOnly 27% said that their experience is even worse than their parents think — the rest said it was either about right or better, the survey said.\n\nIt makes sense that adult perspectives would be skewed, said Michelle Icard, a parenting educator and speaker and the author of “Fourteen Talks by Age Fourteen: The Essential Conversations You Need to Have With Your Kids Before They Start High School.”\n\n“Offloading their negative experiences with social media to parents is one of the ways tweens and teen cope,” she said via email. “Often, our kids report what went wrong in their day, in person or online, but they forget to come back and let us know when their issues resolved or stopped being painful. So, parents carry around worry long after kids have shrugged something off.”\n\nThe positives\n\nThe teens who responded to the survey said the good things they get out of social media include feeling connection and getting support from a community.\n\nIn total, 80% said social media gives them some level of connection to what is going on in their friends’ lives, 71% said it’s a place where they can show their creativity, 67% said social media reassures them that they have people to support them through tough times, and 58% said it makes them feel more accepted, according to the survey.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens were more likely than their White counterparts to report feeling more accepted because of social media, the data showed.\n\nEspecially during the pandemic, the kids Icard worked with were grateful they could still connect with one another, she said. And if encouraged the right way, Icard has seen social media as a good way to showcase talents and humor.\n\nAnd the teens tend to use it that way, the data showed. The top three things teens reported posting about were their accomplishments, family and emotions, according to the survey.\n\nThe survey participants were more likely to say social media is mostly positive or neutral for them personally, but they leaned in more of a negative direction when it came to its impact on people their age, the survey said.\n\n“People might see a lot of benefits from technology and in this case social media,” Anderson said, “but are much more likely to see the downsides when looking at social media as a whole.”\n\nThe negatives\n\nThis survey can be helpful to get an overview of social media and teens, but there are still individual circumstances and downsides to consider, Icard said.\n\nFor example, girls ages 15 to 17 were more likely than any other group to say that they don’t post things on social media because they are worried about being embarrassed, the survey said.\n\nAnd girls more so than boys were likely to report feeling overwhelmed by drama on social media, the study said.\n\nBut all groups acknowledged downsides. Those who reported negative experiences attributed them mostly to screen time, mental health and the impact of online drama, the survey said.\n\nAnd 60% of all teens report feeling little to no control over the data social media companies collect from them.\n\n“Social media is a tool and as such, it’s neither all good nor all bad,” Icard said.\n\n“You know your child’s temperament, social life, and experiences best,” she said via email. “Regardless of how the majority of kids self-report, your decision should take into account your child’s unique situation first.”\n\nHow to optimize the experience\n\nHow do you optimize the experience for yourself or your child then?\n\nIcard recommended a slow exposure, allowing children to join one social media app at a time and only expanding when they demonstrate sufficient responsibility to use them without damage to their sense of self.\n\n“I also think parents should teach their kids app etiquette as well as safety,” Icard said, “and they should monitor more at the beginning but then (taper) off over time.”\n\nHave conversations frequently about what is happening on these platforms. While you can give more autonomy over time, “a child who is unwilling to discuss their experiences on the app might not be ready for one,” she added.\n\nDon’t begin panicking about having a teen on social media, as the experience comes with ups and downs just like any other part of life, Icard said.\n\n“But if parents notice that social media creates feelings that are harmful to their adolescent’s sense of self,” she added, “it would be appropriate to consult with a therapist who can help with more positive self-talk and habits.”", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/health/family-connections-flourish-parenting-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Children are more likely to succeed if they live in this type of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChildren with strong family connections are associated with a high likelihood of flourishing in life, a new study found.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that strong family bonds lower the chances of poor outcomes in children such as risky behaviors and drug abuse, but this study revealed that there may be positive outcomes as well, said lead study author Dr. Robert Whitaker, director of the Columbia-Bassett research program at Columbia University in New York City.\n\n“What was different about this study was it showed that family connection is associated with thriving and not just surviving or avoiding harm,” Whitaker said.\n\nResearchers surveyed over 37,000 children in 26 countries and found adolescents who reported having a great bond with their family also reported that they were succeeding in life.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, included children ages 11 to 13 years old who were surveyed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe data was gathered across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America from the International Survey of Children’s Well-Being, a survey supported by the Jacobs Foundation, a Zurich-based organization that focuses on providing schools around the globe with science-based knowledge to help kids succeed.\n\nFamily connection was determined by a mean score of five categories: care, support, safety, respect, and participation. For each subject, participants were given a statement and asked to assess how much they agreed with it, scoring from zero (do not agree) to 4 (strongly agree). For example, to measure care, children were asked how much they agreed with the statement, “I feel safe at home.”\n\nThe essence of family connection is children feeling that they are accepted and nurtured at home, which allows them to learn what their strengths and weaknesses are in a safe environment as they are building their identity, Whitaker said.\n\nFlourishing was determined by a mean score of six categories: self-acceptance, purpose in life, positive relations with others, personal growth, environmental mastery and autonomy. The survey structure was the same as that for family connections, except the ranking system ranged from zero to 10.\n\nWhen it comes to flourishing, it’s about kids accepting their strengths and weaknesses and then being able to use their strengths to find their purpose in life, he said.\n\nChildren can thrive, not just survive\n\nChildren with the greatest level of family connection were over 49% more likely to flourish compared with those with the lowest level of family connection, according to the study.\n\nIt’s not enough to not have depression and anxiety to live a good life, according to Elaine Reese, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“A good life entails having a sense of purpose and meaning, which is what the flourishing scale in this study measured,” she said.\n\nThe highest scores in both family connection and flourishing came from children who said they live with both parents, have enough food or never have their family worrying about finances.\n\nResearchers then controlled the data for families’ poverty levels, including financial circumstances and food insecurity, to remove the effect they may have had on the numbers. After controlling for these factors, the strength of family connections still impacted how much children flourished.\n\nHow to strengthen family connection\n\nAdults have a very powerful influence on the emotional climate in the home, so it’s important to create a space where children feel seen and heard, Whitaker said.\n\nA great opportunity to strengthen family bonds is around the dinner table, he said. Adults should create an environment where children feel comfortable speaking freely. While they are talking, grown-ups should show that they have a genuine interest in what their children are saying and try to suspend judgment, Whitaker added.\n\nAdults do not need to make grand gestures to bond with their children, Reese said. Having meaningful conversations is more important for your connection than taking them on expensive trips, she said.\n\nSilence is also another powerful form of communication, he said.\n\nChildren and parents or their caregivers spending time together in silence or even running an errand or doing chores can create a connection, according to Whitaker.\n\n“We don’t necessarily need to fill those moments with chatter or the radio,” he said.\n\nOther adults may impact how children flourish\n\nIn the future, Whitaker said he wants to research the impact community members like teachers have on children.\n\n“We suspect that sense of connection to non-parental adults probably adds to the likelihood that teen will flourish,” he said in an email.\n\nOutside relationships are important and do impact children, especially during infancy and early childhood, said Kelly-Ann Allen, an educational and developmental psychologist and senior lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She was not involved in the study.\n\n“If children experience healthy trusting relationships early, they are more likely to establish healthy trusting relationships as adults,” she said.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/homemade-baby-food-toxic-metals-wellness/index.html", "title": "Homemade baby food contains as many toxic metals as store ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMaking baby food at home with store-bought produce isn’t going to reduce the amount of toxic heavy metals in the food your baby eats, according to a new report released exclusively to CNN.\n\n“We found no evidence to suggest that homemade baby foods made from store-bought produce are better than store-bought baby foods when it comes to heavy metal contamination,” said the paper’s coauthor Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures. An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors, HBBF, which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States – including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are among the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also pored over data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared at home. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourth of the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion, according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used in homemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregivers can help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and instead choosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human body doesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregivers need to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/06/11/disabled-not-special-needs-experts-explain-why-never-use-term/7591024002/", "title": "Disabled not 'special needs': Experts explain why we shouldn't say it", "text": "In our daily lives, we may encounter phrases like \"I am disabled\" or \"My child has special needs.\" And to someone who is not part of the community, this wording may seem synonymous.

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

And everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game. Its game tokens included emojis and a hashtag. Courtesy Hasbro\n\n“It’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one,” he says, “which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years.”\n\nNot to mention that millennials have faced a far bleaker financial picture than older generations, Kimbrough says.\n\n“It’s really hard to think about getting married, having kids, moving out with roommates, and making any of these transitions with the housing market like we have now,” Kimbrough says.\n\nMy husband and I are trying not to be too overwhelmed by this daunting reality.\n\nWe’re visiting open houses on most weekends and planning to meet with mortgage brokers soon.\n\nBy this time next year, we hope we’ll be living in a home that we own.\n\nMyth 4: We don’t take our jobs seriously and don’t stay in them very long\n\nJason Dorsey tells me he often asks a question when he’s invited to visit companies and speak with their employees: “How many of you are millennials?”\n\nGenerally, he says, just a few hands timidly go up.\n\n“They’re expecting it to be negative, because that’s unfortunately what we’ve been framed as for the last 15 years,” Dorsey says.\n\nThat’s around when Dorsey says he saw anti-millennial hype intensifying. Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting.

For the first time since March, the national average price for regular gasoline dropped below $4 a gallon today, according to AAA. This comes after gas prices hit a record high of $5.02 in June, largely due to soaring global oil prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The steady decline in gas prices has been driven by multiple factors, including recession fears that have knocked down oil prices and the fact that some people cut back on driving when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon. Despite the decrease, gas prices still remain 25% higher than this time last year.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nChildren younger than 5 in the US could soon begin receiving Covid-19 vaccinations. Pfizer and BioNTech are requesting emergency use authorization for their two-dose Covid-19 vaccine for children age 6 months up to 5 years. The companies are aiming to complete their submission process within the coming days, which will then be reviewed by the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee on February 15. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is already authorized for use in people as young as 5, and the approval would be the first Covid-19 vaccine available for the youngest children. Since the start of the pandemic, at least 11.4 million children have tested positive for Covid-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported Monday, with over 3.5 million cases reported in January alone.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/sleep-apnea-snoring-danger-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to know if your snoring is bad or dangerous (and what to do ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nObstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time.\n\nSnoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea — but at some point in our lives, we all snore. A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles — and before we know it, we’re unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore.\n\n“Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. “When it’s loud, raucous snoring, or it’s interrupted by pauses in breathing, that’s where we start to get concerned.”\n\nIt’s estimated that at least 25 million American adults and 936 million adults between the ages of 30 and 69 worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed.\n\n‘It can be very, very scary’\n\nIt’s called “obstructive” sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea – in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe – obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues.\n\n“You’re making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can’t. Often you aren’t aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nIf left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes or depression, even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\nHow can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG.\n\nS stands for snoring\n\nSnoring is a key indicator, so it’s a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no pitiful, whimpy snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call “cute.”\n\nIf your partner's snores can be heard though a closed door, it's time to see a sleep specialist. Adobe Stock\n\n“We’re talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,” Dasgupta said.\n\nT stands for tired\n\nBeing really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea.\n\n“Falling asleep anytime you have a moment – sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater – those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.\n\nO stands for ‘observed’\n\nMany people – if not most – have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night – unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking.\n\n“The O stands for observed apnea, and that’s actually worse than just snoring,” Dasgupta said. “An apnea means no flow of air – no air coming in no air going out. You’re not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag.”\n\nBed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,” Robbins said.\n\nP stands for pressure – high blood pressure\n\nObstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body’s sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time.\n\nWhile having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea, but they also lower blood pressure.\n\nB stands for BMI\n\nBody mass index is a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 – and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese.\n\nPeople who are obese or extremely obese – with a BMI of 35 and above – are frequently found to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring.\n\n“Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,” Robbins said.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn’t seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added.\n\nA is for age\n\nMuscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being over age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be – or turn into – obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nThere is some good news: Studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages.\n\nHaving a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Now you don’t want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one’s neck build at night,” Dasgupta said. “The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea.”\n\nAre you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more “belly fat,” which can make breathing in general more difficult.\n\n“However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,” Dasgupta said.\n\nHigh-risk needs evaluation\n\nNow it’s time to score your risk. Give yourself a point for every “yes” answer. If you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.\n\nGive yourself a point for every “yes” answer to these questions: Do you snore? Are you tired during the day? Does your partner witness you snoring? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you overweight? Are you older? Do you have a larger neck circumference? Are you a man?\n\nIf you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.\n\n“Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,” Dasgupta said. “You don’t have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice.”\n\nBut don’t ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: “Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention.”\n\nIf your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn’t likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said.\n\n“It’s always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it’s worthwhile getting evaluated,” he said. “If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can’t fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it’s not always about yourself.”\n\nTreatments\n\nThe treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night.\n\nWeight loss can significantly decrease – or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward.\n\nIf anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended.\n\nMild cases of sleep apnea may respond to “positional therapy,” a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring.\n\n“I’m a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,” Dasgupta said.\n\n“You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,” Robbins suggested.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}]}

In addition to breaking Verstappen's impressive run, Sainz was the first driver outside of the Red Bull team to win a race during the 2023 season.\n\nFormula One 2023:Winners from each race this season so far\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris finished second, matching the best finish of his career to date and bringing him the ninth podium finish of his career. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton rounded out the top three at Singapore, marking his fifth podium of the season and extending his career record to 196 such finishes.\n\nWhat happened to Max Verstappen\n\nThe weekend was never Red Bull's from the start, as both Verstappen and Pérez were eliminated during the second stage of qualifying to determine the starting position in Sunday's race. The reigning champion started in 11th on Sunday with Pérez beginning in 13th.\n\nVerstappen ultimately wasn't able to overcome his starting position, finishing the race in fifth behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. His Red Bull teammate, Sergio Pérez, finished eighth, which meant the Singapore race was also the first time neither Red Bull driver finished on the podium in 2023.\n\nVerstappen still holds a 151-point lead for the Drivers' Championship over the second-closest driver, his teammate, Pérez.

Vettel, a four-time World Drivers' Champion who retired in 2022, initially set the record in 2013.\n\nThe Dutch driver's fifth place finish also meant an end to his streak of 15 straight podiums. That streak matched two-time champion (and current Aston Martin driver) Fernando Alonso's 2005-2006 run for the third-longest podium streak ever.\n\nFormula One legend Michael Schumacher still holds the longest podium streak with 19 straight between 2001 and 2002.

We just tried to play the long game,” Verstappen said.\n\n“They were really quick through corners and we were really quick on the straight. The tires were wearing out quite quick. You could see by the end we had a little bit more pace.\n\n“I tried to get by, it wasn’t easy, they were playing smart tricks in the last corner, but eventually I managed to get ahead.

The Mexican was quick off the line, blocking off second-placed LeClerc as well as maintaining his lead.\n\nHowever, his dream race soon began to unravel.\n\nAn apparent fake pit from Ferrari meant Red Bull chose to pit Perez – losing places – just moments before Nicholas Latifi crashed, causing a safety car to come out which allowed other drivers to pit themselves.\n\nIt meant when the safety car left the track, LeClerc lead, followed by Verstappen with Perez down in fourth after giving up his third spot for a pit lane violation.\n\nAnd with no obstructions ahead of him, the Monegasque driver continued his excellent pace in 2022, having won the opening race of the season in Bahrain last weekend.\n\nThe 24-year-old managed to hold off a flying Verstappen until a virtual safety car was called into place in the 38th lap after two cars both lost drive near the pit lane.\n\nAfter the second safety car of the race was stopped, just like in Bahrain last week, the two young stars did battle once again.\n\nThey went back and forth, with Verstappen getting his nose in front, only for LeClerc to come roaring back.\n\nVerstappen drives in front of LeClerc. Peter Fox/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nBut with just over three laps to go, the Dutch driver took the lead yet again and held on with a vice-like grip to claim his first victory of the season.\n\nBoth Verstappen and LeClerc have expressed their respect for one another before, and they could be seen embracing after their thrilling race.\n\nAnd despite a disappointing finish in Jeddah for LeClerc, he said that “every race should be like this.”\n\n“It was not enough today. I really enjoyed that race, it was hard racing but fair! Every race should be like this. It was fun, I wanted to win today,” he said.\n\n“We had two very different configurations with the Red Bulls. We were quite quick in the corner, but slow in straights. It was extremely difficult for me to cover Max in the straight. Max did a great job, it was a fun race.”\n\nVerstappen and Leclerc embrace after the Saudi GP.

Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff told reporters teams had been “assured that we are protected” and the track was “probably the safest place that you can be in Saudi Arabia” at the moment.\n\nHowever, sources told CNN drivers felt uneasy after the attack and many did not want to drive in the race.\n\nThe Houthis said they used a “large number” of drones to target the facility in Friday’s attack.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said one ballistic missile and 10 bomb-laden drones launched from the southern border by the Iran-backed rebels were intercepted, according to Saudi state-run TV channel al-Ekhbariya.

The rapper, who has bipolar disorder, is known to go on public rants, be it about his ex-wife Kim Kardashian dating Pete Davidson, saying slavery \"sounds like a choice\" or falsely claiming that George Floyd died from fentanyl rather than \"cardiopulmonary arrest,\" complicated by \"restraint and neck compression\" while he was being subdued by police, as the Hennepin County medical examiner's office ruled in June 2020.\n\nThe rapper was locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts due to statements he made earlier this month. Spokespeople for Twitter and Instagram said Ye posted messages that violated their policies. His comments have been widely condemned by experts as antisemitic: American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch last week dubbed Ye's words “a clear and present danger to every Jewish person.”\n\nYe flip-flopped his stance on his previous comments in his recent interviews, at one point defending his \"death con 3\" tweet to Cuomo (“It's like a modern-day slavery, and I'm calling it out. It didn't mean I wish any harm on my fellow Jewish people”).\n\nHe later told Morgan in an interview set to air in full on Friday that he does not regret his antisemitic remarks. “I fought fire with fire,” said Ye, acknowledging the “racist” nature of his comments.\n\nBut Ye also told the British talk-show host that he apologizes for the “hurt and confusion” caused by his tweet. “Hurt people hurt people, and I was hurt,” he said.\n\n'Because they do':Ye tells Tucker Carlson why he wore 'White Lives Matter' sweatshirt\n\nYe's antisemitic remarks garner public backlash from celebrities, experts\n\nActors Jamie Lee Curtis and Sarah Silverman, both of whom are Jewish, also used their platform to speak out against the hateful messages shared by Ye.\n\nCurtis, 63, responded on Twitter: \"The holiest day in Judaism was last week. Words matter. A threat to Jewish people ended once in a genocide. Your words hurt and incite violence. You are a father. Please stop.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Silverman, 51, questioned why Ye's tweet didn't get bigger traction. \"Kanye threatened the Jews yesterday on twitter and it’s not even trending,\" she wrote. \"Why do mostly only Jews speak up against Jewish hate? The silence is so loud.\"\n\nMore in Hollywood have since spoken out: \"Weird how all these 'free, independent thinkers' always land at the same old anti blackness and anti semitism,\" John Legend tweeted. Comedian D.L. Hughey told Cuomo that Ye has \"made a great living co-opting the pain of Black people\" and \"sounds a lot like a white supremacist.\" Kerry Washington commended HBO's sports talk show \"The Shop,\" which stars LeBron James and Maverick Carter, for announcing it would not air a recently-taped interview with the rapper, which Carter told Andscape was used to \"reiterate more hate speech and extremely dangerous stereotypes.\"\n\nYe locked out of social mediafor antisemitism; Jamie Lee Curtis, Sarah Silverman, more react\n\nSeveral leaders from Jewish advocacy organizations have also spoken out against Ye's comments, which they argue spread harmful stereotypes and have been \"embraced by antisemitic extremist groups,\" as the Anti-Defamation League wrote.\n\n\"With his vile online comments, West effectively encouraged hatred against Jews at a time when antisemitism and other hate crimes have risen to alarming levels around the world,\" Deutch said in a statement issued on Oct. 12. \"This cannot be countenanced. West has acknowledged he suffers from bipolar disorder, but mental illness is no excuse for antisemitism. Let’s hope he gets the help he desperately needs. Until then, Twitter, Instagram should follow their own guidelines prohibiting hate speech and keep West’s anti-Jewish hate off their channels.”\n\nA record number of antisemitic incidents were recorded across the United States in 2021, according to a study released earlier this year from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group that has been tallying attacks on the Jewish community since 1979. The 2,717 incidents were a 34% increase from 2020 and included rising cases of harassment, assaults and antisemitic vandalism.\n\nAn Oct. 14 statement from the ADL added: \"Ye also invoked the antisemitic belief that Jewish people are disproportionately powerful and that they control the media, including the music industry. This trope has been present in the discourse of other Black performers and activists in the past and is a common talking point within more extremist groups.\"\n\nThe Black Jewish Entertainment Alliance tweeted condemning Ye: “The Black and Jewish communities must stand together through incidents like this to make clear that trafficking in hateful stereotypes is unacceptable & that the words of one entertainer do not reflect the views of an entire community.”\n\nNo, Ye's mental health does notexcuse antisemitism, experts say\n\nHow does Ye's 'White Lives Matter' sweatshirt controversy play into this?\n\nYe claimed the “Jewish media” has been hostile in their coverage of him after he was criticized for wearing a black sweatshirt with the phrase \"WHITE LIVES MATTER\" written across the back.\n\n“When I wore the White Lives Matter t-shirt, the Jewish underground media mafia already started attacking me,” Ye said. “They canceled my four So-Fi Stadium shows. They had the press, back when I was arguing with Pete Davidson and Trevor Noah, they called me an abuser for arguing with people about my ex-wife and my family and when I get to see my kids.”\n\nHis sweatshirts were met with backlash from many in the fashion community, including British Vogue Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful, model Gigi Hadid and Vogue global fashion editor-at-large Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who called the sweatshirts \"deeply offensive, violent and dangerous.\"\n\nMother of George Floyd's daughterplans to file lawsuit against Ye\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/05/02/high-fashion-has-inclusivity-problem-designers-legacy/7369209001/", "title": "The Met Gala's exclusivity is outdated.

The outfits bring attention to various fashion houses and to celebrity names as they strive to be placed on an unofficial list of the gala's best dressed.\n\nAn invitation to the Met ball, often selected by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, is typically reserved for Hollywood and fashion's most elite.

But because of the industry's interest in selling an aspirational, unattainable fantasy, it may never be able to change until cultural standards of beauty steer away from thin and white or until new diverse talent is embraced.\n\nLast year, the gala took two steps forward by inviting beauty influencer Jackie Aina, who was the first Black content creator ever to attend Met Gala, and YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, who paid homage to LGBTQ activist Marsha P. Johnson with her gown. But the same event also took one step back as it ignored a handful of Black designers.\n\nFormula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton publicly corrected the invite list of the 2021 gala by paying for tickets of three Black designers — Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson and Jason Rembert — to attend their industry's magnum opus event.\n\n\"These designers,\" Lewis wrote on Instagram, \"Deserve this moment just as much as any other designer who attends the Met Gala.\"\n\nFashion designer Tracy Reese, who serves on the Council of Fashion Designers of America's board of directors and has been in the industry for more than 30 years, says minority designers like herself were \"discouraged\" from thinking they'd ever attend the gala in the past.\n\n\"We see more color on the red carpet. But in terms of industry representation, for designers of color that's been very limited,\" Reese says.\n\nWhile young minority designers have been overlooked, the gala's legacy designers are ever-present, even after facing diversity and inclusion faux pas within their operations.\n\nMet Gala designers' history of missteps\n\nBalenciaga, the designer behind Kim Kardashian's incognito Met Gala look, was called out for cultural appropriation in 2021 after releasing their boxer-peeking sweatpants, retailing $1,190 for a style made popular by hip-hop culture and historically denounced and considered lesser by legacy fashion.\n\nSupermodel Iman turned heads in her Dolce and Gabbana (designed by Harris Reed) gown at last year's Met Gala. But just months before, the fashion house was suing fashion bloggers who reposted anti-Asian comments allegedly attributed to one of the label's designers.\n\nPrada and Gucci each had their time under the sun of call-outs after launching designs that stirred blackface controversies.\n\nRacism in fashion:From Gucci to Prada, luxury fashion brands challenged to confront racist attitudes\n\n\"Social media has played a role,\" says Aina of the recent backlash fashion houses have faced. \"You can't really ignore a lack of diversity anymore – people will absolutely make noise, will absolutely call you out and it just makes it so that it's harder to sweep things under the rug.\"\n\nKaren says \"the old guard\" of executives is keeping the fashion's exclusive standard in place and until there's new talent, \"these things (will) still continue.\"\n\nMore:Director Spike Lee boycotts Gucci, Prada brands over blackface fashion\n\nThe needle on fashion inclusion started to nudge forward as Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 made industries rethink their practices, but the rethinking came \"way too late\" says longtime business of culture journalist Christina Binkley.\n\n\"If it takes a massive scandal and your brand being nearly canceled to start thinking about the importance of diversity and inclusion, then you're way, way, way too late,\" Binkley says.\n\nWhen luxury fashion lined up social media posts to show solidarity with Black Lives Matters protests in 2020, more blowback followed.\n\nTransgender model and actress Munroe Bergdorf jumped on L’Oreal’s #BlackoutTuesday posts to accuse the beauty brand of hypocrisy for having fired her when she complained about racism. U.S. trans actress Tommy Dorfman, who once appeared in a campaign for Salvatore Ferragamo, called out the Italian luxury brand for what she called a \"homophobic and racist work environment.”\n\n\"I think that it absolutely feels out of date, and unfashionable and uninteresting for there not to be diversity,\" Reese says. \"I think those walls are breaking down and not just in terms of color, it's also in terms of size, and deciding what is and isn't beautiful.\"\n\nHave brands with inclusion scandals improved?\n\nAfter facing negative feedback over the past few years, many fashion brands have ushered in diversity councils and inclusion initiatives.\n\nL'Oreal rehired Bergdorf after her callout; however in a statement to WWD, Salvatore Ferragamo said they were surprised by Dorfman's comments and added that there's \"no evidence\" of her critique of the label's work environment.\n\nBinkley says sometimes many European brands can be farther removed from understanding racism in America and have had a harder time reacting to pushes for diversity.\n\n\"Somebody who grew up in (Italy, might not) grasp what the civil rights movement in America meant, what slavery for Americans meant – on the one hand, they really need to because America is a big market and they're marketing to America,\" Binkley says.\n\nAt New York Fashion Week in February, nonprofit organization Color of Change teamed up with The Black in Fashion Council, IMG, and model Joan Smalls to introduce an inclusion rider for the fashion industry to lay out guidelines to steer fashion's post-reckoning promises \"from rhetoric to action.\"\n\nSmall bits of action have been seen with diverse creative director hires including Rhuigi Villaseñor for Bally and June Ambrose for Puma. Major fashion publications have more diverse leadership with Edward Enninful at the top of British Vogue's masthead and Samira Nasr leading Harper's Bazaar. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\n\"It's important that we're talking about everything from size, color, gender, you name it,\" Reese says. \"We've got so much ground to make up for.\"\n\nAccording to CFDA and PVH's 2021 State of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Fashion report, fewer Black fashion industry employees (57%) believed their company was doing enough when it came to racial and gender inclusivity compared to white counterparts (77%) and less than half of Black respondents who agreed (44%) believed these measures would result in permanent change.\n\nBudding designers are key fashion's inclusive future\n\nTo be fashionable goes hand-in-hand with being forward-thinking. Established labels could benefit from calling on budding designers, and up-and-coming designers could benefit from legacy label recognition.\n\nKaren says the gap between new designers and major fashion houses is because the latter is often \"high on the perch\" and unable to see what's coming through the ground level.\n\n\"Those opportunities have to be created for gatekeepers and newcomers to even converse,\" Reese says. \"What's been good to see is how many up and coming designers of color are being selected for things like (CDFA and Vogue's) fashion fund or Woolmark prize.\"\n\nMoments of exposure, like the Met Gala, are key in bringing new culture to fashion through young talent.\n\n\"It's easier to incorporate that ethos of diversity and inclusion if you're starting new, rather than trying to guide a huge ship in a new direction,\" Karen says.\n\nWhile the world waits to see their favorite celeb on the carpet, the industry could benefit on taking note of who they left out.\n\nWhite men still run the fashion industry:Report shows there's a long road ahead toward inclusion\n\nReese says its \"necessary\" for us to include new voices in fashion, if the industry doesn't it will come complacent and irrelevant like last season's wardrobe.\n\nShe adds: \"We get lazy and go for what's easy. And we stop exploring. We stop being curious. And that's really unfashionable, isn't it?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/11/28/virgil-abloh-dies-louis-vuitton-off-white-designer-mourned-celebs/8787333002/", "title": "Virgil Abloh mourned by Kanye West, Kardashians, Hailey Bieber, BTS", "text": "The fashion world is paying tribute to Virgil Abloh, the trailblazing Louis Vuitton director who died Sunday at age 41.\n\nAbloh, the artistic director for Louis Vuitton menswear and founder and CEO of fashion house Off-White, died after a private battle with a \"rare, aggressive form of cancer,\" according to social media posts from the brands.\n\nHe was a pioneer in the fashion world, serving as the first Black artistic director to lead Louis Vuitton menswear.

Facebook (FB) recently changed its name to Meta Platforms. Nike (NKE) bought a virtual shoe company to help it expand to the metaverse. And other brands like Gucci and Ralph Lauren have been considering the future of fashion with digital personas.\n\nWith all the attention, it can be difficult for general news consumers to parse through what is a marketing gimmick versus what really matters. It requires journalists to approach the tech industry’s new favorite buzzword with an open mind and with nuance, something that the media hasn’t always been consistent with in years past, according to Gideon Lichfield, global editorial director of Wired.\n\n“Every time the industry goes after a new name for something and tries to pivot, something new inevitably comes out of it. It’s just not clear yet what it will be,” Lichfield said. “I think one has to be really critical of this tendency and call out what is just marketing and hype, which is a large part of it, whilst remaining open-minded to the fact that something new does emerge.”\n\nAt Wired, Lichfield oversees how the preeminent tech magazine covers these topics and other new tech trends for its website and print magazine. The latest print issue, featuring actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II on the cover, focuses on the future of reality.\n\nLichfield spoke with CNN Business about how tech journalism’s evolution, diversity in media and his predictions of next year’s biggest tech stories.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nYou wrote in a recent editor’s letter that the tech industry is at “an inflection point.” What exactly do you mean by that, and where does the media fall into that turn of events?\n\nGideon Lichfield Christopher Michel\n\nI think we went from this period of a lot of hype about tech utopianism in the 90s, which is when Wired was created, then all the way over to the techlash of the 2010s and the tech industry became the big demon. I think the media coverage of the tech industry, which was focusing on the very real problems around tech has contributed to that. One of the things I saw coming out of the pandemic was what seemed like a surge of sentiment in the other direction.\n\nI feel like it’s helpful for us to just try to get out of this swinging back and forth between tech is great, tech is bad, tech is great.\n\nThe tech press is in the middle of covering two massive scandals right now: The Facebook Papers and the Congressional hearings about Facebook, and then there’s the Elizabeth Holmes’ trial. How do you see these two events being covered? What is the press getting right? What could they improve on?\n\nThat’s an interesting one. I think I actually can talk more about the Facebook one. I don’t think I’ve followed the coverage of the Elizabeth Holmes trial as closely.\n\nThat’s okay. I just think with what you said [the Holmes trial] is a good example of someone who was lauded and changing the world and now she’s on trial.\n\nWhat I can say about Elizabeth Holmes is I think that probably the early coverage of her — not talking about what’s happening now — there was probably a bit of this tendency, which Wired has been guilty of too in the past, of going, “Oh, wow, here’s this person doing this amazing thing, and it could be totally transformative.” And either not being able to or not wanting to look a little harder and say, “Well, you know, just how likely is it that this will succeed?” And I think there’s a certain style of tech coverage which has been this thing is really cool. It could be amazing, and we’re going to completely suspend judgment on how plausible it actually is. I think it behooves us to have that critical lens.\n\nOn Facebook, the thing that has struck me about it is we all, and Wired included, did a lot of coverage of the Facebook Papers and what came out of them. And that’s important, and I think that it probably drives the conversation on Capitol Hill, which ultimately is where this matters. That’s where the regulation is going to come out of. But part of me asked: How much does this actually talk to the general public? How much of this stuff are they reading? There was almost too much detail, too many revelations, too many little things. And as with other things in the past like the financial crisis or the health care reform, I think the public can get a certain amount of fatigue. There’s all this detail, but what am I actually supposed to just think about this?\n\nI recently read a tweet from Sara M. Watson, a principal analyst at Forrester, who wrote, “[T]he media cycle shift toward crypto, web3, metaverse etc. increasingly feels like tech has architected a successful pivot to redirect attention on to the next thing, rather than dealing with what they’ve already built and broken.” Do you agree with that sentiment?\n\nWhen people are talking about the metaverse, they’re appropriating a term from this novel that imagines the metaverse as a certain kind of thing and they’re trying to bring the idealism or that idea to a very different and very disparate set of experiences. Web3 similarly feels like an attempt to put a new, easy to understand catchy label on a bunch of stuff that is happening. And that was true Web2 as well, and yet, in hindsight, you can say that having that label helped coalesce or crystallize some shifts that were happening on the web and on the internet in industry in general. That did mark a real trend, mark some changes. So here again, I’m trying to inject nuance. I’m saying yes, I agree. It’s marketing. It’s relabeling. The same problems exist, and the same problems that we have on social media spaces today will carry over into virtual spaces and metaverse spaces. And so one should approach it with a great deal of caution and at the same time open to the question: What new stuff might emerge?\n\nSo good writing to you is making information easy to distill and nuance and also being very clear to the public?\n\nNuance and clarity and not flooding people with stuff.\n\nThe media and the tech industries have both suffered from a lack of diversity. The top leadership at Wired — you, the global editorial director, and your deputy Greg Williams — are white men. What effect do you think that has on your coverage?\n\nI don’t know what effect directly it has on the coverage because the stories that we do on a day-to-day basis are being generated from all across the newsroom and at all levels. It’s not like me and Greg are sitting there handing down assignments.\n\nWhat I do think it means though is that we have to absolutely make an even greater effort than we would otherwise to make sure that we’re recruiting as diversely as possible and continuing to fill the ranks so that the next generation of Wired leadership can be not white men. And also so that everybody in the newsroom does feel like they can work in an environment where there are no biases, there are no assumptions, there are no things that are affecting the work or leading to exclusionary decisions and making sure that whenever there are important decisions to be taken that there are people in the room who are a mix.\n\nDo you keep an ongoing diversity report on your newsroom?\n\nWired was doing this before I arrived. We’ve done a staff diversity audit, and we’ve a couple of times taken a month and done a contributor diversity audit. And we’ve talked about doing the source diversity audit as well. That’s more intensive, but that’s something that we want to keep on doing periodically and just try to keep track of who’s writing for us.\n\nAre there any platforms that you want to grow for Wired?\n\nThere’s no one particular platform where I can tell you, “Yeah, this is somewhere that we’re going to be.” But I just want to have from the ground up honest conversation about let’s say TikTok. What would it mean to be authentically Wired on TikTok, not to be a cringey form of Wired, right? Not to do something because it’s cool or just because it’s an audience grab but because we think this is a genuine way to express what Wired is about.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest tech stories of 2022? How would you say that the media industry, Wired included, should be covering these stories?\n\nI think the crypto and NFT boom is going to continue to be a big one, and the way I want us to cover that is to try to, again, nuance. Sort the wheat from the chaff, sort the reality from the hype, but at least try to forge a path between these really polar opposites of discourse about the industry, which it’s either it’s all a scam or it’s going to completely change the world. There’s something in there that I don’t know what it is yet that is going to emerge. I’ve not yet seen a long-term application of crypto that really convinces me that is transformative. But that doesn’t mean that’s not there, and I want us to keep looking for it.\n\nI think that the metaverse conversation will continue and at this point it feels to me it’s almost like a terminological land grab. In other words, people are fighting for the definition of what the metaverse is. I don’t think we’re going to get the answer to that, at least not in the next year. But I think we should continue to cover the companies that are claiming to be building the metaverse and asking the serious questions about what are you actually building and how is it different? And continue to ask the same questions we were asking before which is how is it going to be safe for people? Who’s benefiting from it?\n\nThe cover of Wired's December issue Thompson Samuel Ekong/WIRED\n\nI think the regulation of Facebook and tech regulation more broadly story in the US is going to continue to be really interesting. I don’t know whether it’s going to get out of partisan deadlock. And there will be some sort of breakthrough before the midterm elections or whether it will just stay stuck there, but I think that’ll really be interesting to watch.\n\nSimilarly, by contrast, the regulatory efforts that are going on in Europe. There’s actually more happening on tech regulation in Europe and has been for a while than there is in the US and to some extent that’s starting to set the agenda, I think, for US companies, and I think an interesting thing to watch.\n\nThe China-US rivalry over technology and in general, whether it’s on AI supremacy or export controls, trade barriers, intellectual property that I think is going to continue holding up and we have to keep covering that really closely.\n\nWhat if anything gets implemented from COP26, very important climate story.\n\nThe continuing aftermath for the pandemic, both in terms of health, obviously, and how we manage the pandemic and whether or not we get vaccines to the places that need them, but also the continuing readjustment in work, how people work, the relation between employers and employees, the economic impact of people moving to different places, migrating, working remotely.", "authors": ["Kerry Flynn"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/media/954539/chris-mason-who-is-the-bbcs-new-political-editor", "title": "Chris Mason: who is the BBC's new political editor? | The Week", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

He has spent the two decades since at the BBC, working on its regional desk at Westminster and as a political reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live. In 2012 he became a political correspondent for BBC News, covering British politics on national TV over the course of a decade during which he “developed his distinctive ‘earnest yet informal’ style in front of the camera”, said politics.co.uk.\n\nHe shot to prominence in 2017 as the presenter of the popular Brexitcast podcast, first with Adam Fleming, and then with Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler.\n\nIn October 2019 Mason became the host of BBC Radio 4‘s Any Questions?, taking over from long-time host Jonathan Dimbleby.\n\nMason lives in southeast London with his wife, who is a primary school teacher, and their two sons.\n\nHow did he get the job?\n\nMason first emerged as favourite for the six-figure-salary job in early April. He is “widely liked across the BBC”, The Guardian said at the time, but did not originally apply as it was seen as a role for a more experienced journalist.\n\nPeople with knowledge of the recruitment process told The Sunday Times that BBC bosses had encouraged him to apply after the “protracted” appointments process “descended into farce” and plans for an all-women shortlist were scrapped.\n\nJonathan Munro, interim director of BBC News, and Katy Searle, its executive editor for politics, had “emphasised during interviews that they wanted a journalist who will produce exclusives”, the paper added. But “Mason is not known for big scoops”.\n\n“They said they wanted someone who breaks stories but I think they’ve realised they actually need a wise statesman who is good at analysing events, and Chris will do brilliantly at that,” a senior political journalist told the paper. “This feels like a moment of self-realisation for the BBC, that they can’t be that bold.”\n\nWhat are his political views?\n\nWhile Mason “is yet to provoke as many (and varying) different claims of bias as his predecessor, his broadcasting career to date has not been shy of controversy”, says politics.co.uk.\n\nThe Independent unearthed a 2000 interview he conducted while still a student with the former chancellor, Norman Lamont, in which he blasted the Lords as a “talking shop for past-it politicians and do-gooders in high places”.\n\n“However, those on the left of the political spectrum have also had their disagreements with Mason,” says politics.co.uk. It cited a December 2021 episode of BBC Breakfast in which Mason was accused of targeting Labour shadow cabinet minister Baroness Chapman, and there was another bias row in 2021 when he intervened to defend former Conservative MP and minister Ann Widdecombe during a live recording of Any Questions?.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\n“Internally, he is seen as the ultimate safe pair of hands – with both the pluses and minuses that entails – for a BBC news operation in transition,” said The Guardian.\n\nHis promotion from a host on Radio 4 to BBC political editor “seems to have taken many people by surprise”, said the Daily Mail, but “the public outpouring of praise appears to have touched the born-and-raised Northerner”.\n\nMason reacted to his appointment to “the most extraordinary job in British broadcasting and journalism” by saying he “clambers upon the shoulders of giants like Laura, Nick Robinson and Andrew Marr with a smattering of trepidation and a shedload of excitement and enthusiasm.\n\n“To lead the best team of journalists in the business on the best news patch of the lot is something I’d never even dared dream of. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nWhat is more, says the Daily Mail, “in this day and age of equality and diversity, Mason’s strong Yorkshire accent will allow BBC bosses to keep Boris Johnson’s prowling Culture Secretary satisfied as the government insists on more regional representation within the corporation’s ranks”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rebekah Evans", "Felicity Capon", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/22"}]}

The response to the attack in which 19 children and two teachers were killed has been denounced as an “abject failure” with enough blame to be spread widely.\n\nThe school police chief was fired and now seven DPS officers are being investigated for what they did – or did not – do. CNN has uncovered exclusively that Elizondo is one of those officers being investigated. A source close to the investigation also confirmed that to CNN.\n\nShe no longer works for DPS. During the summer, she was hired as a police officer for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, where her role is to protect some of the very same children who survived the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nElizondo declined to speak with CNN in person, on the phone or by direct message.\n\nFollowing this CNN report, the school district issued a statement announcing her termination effective Thursday.\n\n“We are deeply distressed by the information that was disclosed yesterday evening concerning one of our recently hired employees, Crimson Elizondo,” the statement from the district said. “We sincerely apologize to the victim’s families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused. Ms. Elizondo’s statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.”\n\n“Regarding the remaining UCISD Police Department employees, we continue to make personnel decisions based on verifiable information. An independent investigation is underway to evaluate the actions of the current officers on May 24, 2022. Additionally, we are awaiting results of a management and organizational review of the UCISD Police Department that will aid the district in taking informed actions to further ensure the safety and security of our schools,” the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Uvalde School District Police were informed as early as July 28 that Elizondo was subject to investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General for actions “inconsistent with training and department requirements,” according to documents obtained by CNN in a public records request.\n\nIt is not clear from the letter which actions were subject to investigation.\n\nParents recognized her\n\nCrimson Elizondo was clearly visible on body camera footage from Uvalde police released by the mayor. Much other footage has not been made public. City of Uvalde\n\nUvalde CISD has said it wanted to recruit 10 more officers after the May 24 attack. It did not specifically announce the hiring of Elizondo over the summer, though the names and photos of her and four other police officers, one lieutenant and one security guard are on its website, under the banner “KEEP U.C.I.S.D. SAFE.”\n\nSuperintendent Hal Harrell told a special town hall meeting in August that at least 33 DPS officers would also be deployed around the district’s eight schools. After initial concern by residents that officers who failed to stop the killing would be tasked with school security, parent Brett Cross told CNN he had been assured the deployed DPS officers would not have been responders to the shooting.\n\nIn her new position, that restriction does not apply to Elizondo. Children and parents walked past her as they headed into the school year at Uvalde Elementary, the new home for the younger students who survived the Robb bloodshed.\n\nAnd some parents, including those who lost children in the massacre, recognized her from the body camera footage released by the mayor, family members told CNN.\n\n“We are disgusted and angry at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s (UCISD) decision to hire Officer Crimson Elizondo. Her hiring puts into question the credibility and thoroughness of UCISD’s HR and vetting practices,” according to a statement from family representatives.\n\nIt made them feel uneasy, CNN has learned, yet another reminder of the deadly day in a town that is full of such reminders.\n\nBut they did not know that she was under investigation.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the school district knew of the investigation when she was hired.\n\nThe statement from family representatives calls for all department officers to be suspended pending a third-party investigation, and its results “must be released” to the public as well as families of the victims.\n\n“Our children have been taken from us. We will not stop fighting until we have answers and we ensure the safety of the children in our community is the top priority,” the statement said.\n\nCross, the legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, one of the children killed at Robb Elementary, says he is “disgusted” by what the district has done.\n\n“I’m absolutely appalled,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper and says the school board met with him and offered to pull such officers to off-campus roles. He says he will continue to hold a vigil outside the school board offices until all officers are suspended.\n\nThe district and its staff have not responded to emails and calls and a personal approach from CNN about this story.\n\nSecret scrutiny\n\nTexas DPS, the state body that helps local law enforcement in major incidents, announced an internal review into its employees who responded to Robb.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN that Elizondo is one of seven officers whose conduct is being investigated by DPS, but neither their names nor their actions or inactions have been made public.\n\nIn a redacted internal memo to the organization’s director obtained by CNN, DPS cited “actions which may be inconsistent with training and requirements” as the reason for the officers being referred for investigation.\n\nSources familiar with the inquiry told CNN that Elizondo was not properly equipped and said to investigators that she was not comfortable going inside the school without her gear.\n\nElizondo was briefly inside the hallway while the attack was ongoing but was not wearing body armor. City of Uvalde\n\nFootage from police body cameras and those of other officers seen by CNN show Elizondo arriving at the outskirts of the school as one of the first officers to respond to the report of an armed man at Robb Elementary.\n\nShe gets out of her official vehicle but does not retrieve any tactical body armor or her long rifle, as officers are trained to do.\n\nShe does not approach the school but stays with officers from other agencies outside the fence until a call comes over the radio, “Shots fired inside the building!”\n\nElizondo runs with other officers to the eastern end of the building that housed connecting classrooms 111 and 112. Soon after, the responding officers are told that the shooter is contained in a room on the west side.\n\nAfter that, there plays out on the recordings the more than one hour of confusion and delay before anyone goes to help the trapped staff and students in rooms 111 and 112, the catalog of errors that has become part of the Uvalde tragedy.\n\nElizondo walked inside the building briefly but mostly stood outside.\n\nAs officers prepared for what became the final breach, she offered to help a colleague and went to gather supplies for him. She was away from the school when the gunman was shot and killed.\n\nWithin moments, the body camera recordings show, the hallway where so many had stood became a scene of carnage as officers got students out of the classrooms and assessed their injuries.\n\nElizondo was soon there, urging students to “go, go, go” if they were able, and not to look at their injuries or the blood on the floor. She comforted one boy as an officer checked his wounds, telling him time and again that she was there with him, that he would be OK and that his parents would soon be told.\n\nThe footage showed she traveled to the hospital in a school bus with students who were shot and traumatized, again helping to take care of them.\n\nDPS director Col. Steven McCraw said in August: “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy.”\n\nTwo weeks later official notes of a meeting showed McCraw telling captains, “No one is losing their jobs.” McCraw told CNN he had been misquoted in the minutes and vowed “no one gets a pass.”\n\nElizondo, on the right in her new UCISD uniform, declined to talk to CNN. CNN\n\nHe said he would release all the information when he could, but the local district attorney has asked him not to do so until the criminal investigations are completed, a process he has acknowledged could take years.\n\nProsecutor Christina Mitchell Busbee will charge anyone who has committed a crime at Robb Elementary, including law enforcement officers, she’s said.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Public Safety, which declined to comment for this story.\n\nA coalition of news organizations including CNN is suing the DPS for records relating to the investigation that have been withheld from the media and public.\n\nSo far, the only person known to have lost their job over the response to the shooting has been school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who was fired by the school board in August. Arredondo became the figurehead of the failed response, though he has said he did not consider himself the incident commander and has called to be reinstated.\n\nElizondo earned a base salary of $59,715 at DPS, according to a database compiled by The Texas Tribune, reflecting a 12% raise a year ago. She joined the department in 2018.\n\nHer new salary is not known, but a job posting for a similar role has a lower salary range, from $41,584 to $59,158.\n\nThat posting lists mental and physical demands of the position, including an “Ability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons … under intense threatening conditions.”\n\nOn May 24, as she rode the school bus back to Robb Elementary from the hospital, she told another officer: “Nothing could prepare you for what they brought out. It was horrible.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Matthew J. Friedman Rachel Clarke", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Matthew J.

CNN has reached out to the deputies and officer.\n\nThe deputies are not rookies and have been in law enforcement “for some time,” while the Mulberry officer has been in policing for “many years” and previously worked for the sheriff’s department, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante told reporters Monday. They are suspended with pay, he said.\n\nThe US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas confirmed it had opened a federal civil rights investigation. The FBI Little Rock field office and the US Justice Department’s civil rights division are also investigating, according to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office.\n\nAnalysts: Use of force seems excessive\n\nThe video, which was posted on social media, shows the officers restraining an individual – identified by state police as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina – near a curb outside a business. One officer throws punches at the person’s face and slams his head to the ground, while another knees the individual in the side and back.\n\nA woman who is not seen on the video says, “Don’t beat him! He needs his medicine!” One officer responds, “Back the f**k up!” while another orders her to get in her car.\n\n“We do not know what would happen if that person would not have been videoing,” said Carrie Jernigan, one of Worcester’s attorneys. “The fight was escalating with those officers and you hear that woman on that video yelling, and whoever that is, I think she could’ve saved his life.”\n\nDamante declined to get into many specifics, emphasizing the case remains under investigation, but said the actions he saw on the video are “not indicative of the Crawford County Sheriff’s Department or any law enforcement agency in this area.”\n\nThe deputies “will be punished for what they did, if they’re found to be in violation of any rights,” the sheriff said.\n\nNone of the officers was wearing a body camera, but the Mulberry officer had a dashboard camera on his squad car, which provided details on how the scuffle began, the sheriff said without elaborating.\n\nRandal Worcester leaves the Crawford County Justice Center in Van Buren, Arkansas, on Monday. Andrew DeMillo/AP\n\nTwo CNN senior law enforcement analysts say, judging solely from the video footage, the use of force appears excessive.\n\nWorcester is charged with second-degree battery, resisting arrest, possessing an instrument of crime, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, terroristic threatening and first- and second-degree assault, Arkansas State Police said.\n\nWorcester allegedly threatened a gas station clerk in a neighboring town, Damante told CNN affiliate KHBS. When he was spotted in Mulberry, Worcester was initially cooperative, but then tried to attack the officers, leading to the confrontation in the video, Damante told the station.\n\nThe suspect told officers he had a weapon, but the sheriff believes Worcester handed it over before the fight ensued, he told reporters Monday.\n\nWorcester suffered multiple abrasions to his face, scrapes on his knees, scratches, a swollen right ear and had his eye gouged during the altercation with the law enforcement officers, attorney David Powell said.\n\n“Lots of things happened to him that should not have happened during this altercation,” Powell said.\n\nWorcester was released on $15,000 bail, Powell said. He had his bicycle with him as attorneys escorted him out of the detention center, and he gave no audible response to a reporter’s question. He will be staying with family, his lawyers said.\n\n‘It doesn’t make sense’\n\nFor two CNN senior law enforcement analysts, there remain questions about what happened before and after the moment caught on video. Yet even if Worcester attacked the officers as alleged, the level of force with which they respond seems excessive, the analysts said.\n\n“Especially the blows to the face and head,” said former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. “At one point in time, you see one of the officers actually lift the head and push it down into the pavement. Obviously, that raises the level of force considerably.” It also heightens the risk of serious injury or death, he said.\n\nRamsey continued, “Certainly the blows to the head at the same time you’re trying to get a person to put their hands behind their back – think about it. It doesn’t make sense. If you’re getting hit in the face, you’re going to lift your hands to try to protect your face.”\n\nRamsey and fellow CNN analyst Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, say it’s difficult to imagine what could necessitate the officers’ violent response.\n\nCrawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante says officers did not wear body cameras. KHBS\n\n“It is important to remember that this video only catches a portion of the interaction between this individual who was arrested and the three officers,” McCabe said. “Importantly, those officers maintain that before the video that he attacked one of them, punched him in the head, pushed him to the ground. So, there was obviously a scuffle here that led to the use of force.\n\n“However, what we see on that video, it is very, very hard to argue that what you’re seeing – the sort of punches and the kneeing him in the back and slamming his head … on the ground. That is not acceptable, normal, standard police use of force under really any circumstances.”\n\nIt’s important to consider there are three officers on a single suspect, McCabe said, and the lawmen do not appear to be using any accepted techniques for handcuffing a suspect.\n\nRather, it appears to be an “incredibly violent assault seemingly on a person on the ground and under the control of three officers,” he said. “I’m finding it impossible to justify what you’re seeing on that video really in any way.”\n\nIf attacked, police have a right to respond with necessary, proportionate and objectively reasonable force, Ramsey said, but the Arkansas officers’ reactions seem neither proportionate nor reasonable. Being attacked “doesn’t give you permission to then use excessive force when taking the individual into custody, period. It just doesn’t,” the former police chief said.\n\nSuspect held on $15,000 bail\n\nThe person who posted the video online said her sister witnessed the altercation outside the Kountry Xpress in Mulberry.\n\n“In reference to the video circulating on social media involving two Crawford County Deputies, we have requested that Arkansas State Police conduct the investigation and the Deputies have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation,” the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\nThe Mulberry police officer is on administrative leave pending the investigation’s outcome, his department said.\n\n“The City of Mulberry and the Mulberry Police Department takes these investigations very seriously and holds all their officers accountable for their actions,” a Mulberry police statement said.\n\nRandal Worcester stands charged with assault, battery and other counts. Crawford County Sheriff's Office\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson found the officers’ actions to be “reprehensible conduct in which a suspect is beat in that fashion,” but said the video shows only a “glimpse” of the encounter.\n\nWithout elaborating, he said Worcester “had a history of concern that was legitimate for the officers” but also said the officers’ response was “not consistent” with their training.\n\n“This is not what our law enforcement community represents. It’s not the proper response, and they will be reviewed and appropriate action taken consistent with” the findings of the investigation, the governor said.\n\nArkansas State Police issued a statement saying its investigation “will be limited to the use of physical force by the deputies and the police officer,” and its findings will be submitted to a local prosecutor who will decide if the use of force was consistent with state law. A spokesperson told CNN the statement was the office’s only comment on the case.", "authors": ["Eliott C. Mclaughlin Andy Rose Hannah Sarisohn", "Eliott C.

She then asked him to let her go and showed him her badge.\n\nO’Connor apologized to the deputy and then gave him her business card. “If you ever need anything, call me. Seriously,” she said.\n\nO’Connor and the deputy thanked each other for their service, and the couple was allowed to leave.\n\nThe mayor admonished O’Connor’s actions in a statement released Monday.\n\n“The Tampa Police Department has a code of conduct that includes high standards for ethical and professional behavior that apply to every member of our police force. As the Chief of Police, you are not only to abide by and enforce those standards but to also lead by example. That clearly did not happen in this case,” Castor said.\n\n“It is unacceptable for any public employee, and especially the city’s top law enforcement leader, to ask for special treatment because of their position.”\n\nO’Connor was sworn in as Tampa’s police chief in March, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported at the time, noting she had served the department for 22 years, rising to the rank of assistant chief before retiring in 2016.\n\nOver that time, O’Connor worked with a police chaplain to implement a post-trauma training and retreat program to help officers cope with symptoms of stress associated with first responder careers, Bay News 9 reported. She also helped launch the Resources in Community Hope House program as a safe-haven in a high-crime neighborhood, the station said.\n\nShe also has served as an instructor for the FBI’s Law Enforcement Executive Development Association, her LinkedIn profile states.\n\nThe mayor on Monday recognized O’Connor’s contributions as police chief, including “reducing violent gun crime, proactively engaging with our community and focusing on officer wellness,” Castor said.\n\n“But these accomplishments pale in comparison to the priority I place on integrity.”\n\nIn a Monday resignation letter, O’Connor wrote she “would never want my personal mistake to stand in the way of the progress I have made in mending relationships between the police department and the community, so for that reason, I am resigning.”\n\nThe mayor expects the national search and hiring process for a new Tampa police chief to take several months, she said.\n\nIn interim chief Bercaw, “we have a thoughtful and highly regarded leader in progressive policing,” Castor said. “I am grateful he can hit the ground running and continue working with our community to keep our city safe.”", "authors": ["Melissa Alonso Devon M.

His death led to scores of policing reforms some now predict will be undermined by a law enforcement approach that largely targets communities of color. Floyd’s fatal police encounter started with a 911 call about a counterfeit $20 bill used to buy a pack of cigarettes.\n\n“A lot of the quality-of-life offenses that communities are complaining about they don’t know who else to call but the cops,” said Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney with The Legal Aid Society’s Cop Accountability Project in New York.\n\n“Our society has been conditioned to call the cops for every single issue when we shouldn’t necessarily be doing that… We throw the cops at everything, which means they are now expected to do more and be more and wear more hats – many of which they are not able to or qualified to do.”\n\n‘You’re not going to just do whatever you want’\n\nNYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell on Wednesday unveiled an initiative to reduce shootings and thefts, as well as quality-of-life offenses such as drinking on the streets, loud parties in public spaces and driving with suspended or revoked licenses.\n\nSewell and Mayor Eric Adams insist the strategy is not a return to a broken windows policy that helped spur another controversial NYPD practice known as stop-and-frisk – which was ruled unconstitutional nearly a decade ago for unlawfully targeting Blacks and Latinos.\n\n“To be clear, this is not a return to ‘Stop, Question, and Frisk’ – nor is it ‘policing for numbers,’ ” Sewell said in a statement. “This enforcement will be responsive to community complaints and concerns.”\n\nJeff Asher, a crime analyst who co-founded Datalytics, which evaluates criminal justice data, said studies have shown more aggressive policing to be ineffective in reducing violent crime.\n\n“We’ve learned that stop and frisk is not the answer, that violence reduction can happen independent of that, and we saw that in New York over many years,” he said. “So as far as … data providing credence that we should have more of those policies, I don’t think there’s any evidence of that.”\n\nThe NYPD said that since 2019, calls about drinking on the street more than doubled to 3,193 from 1,452, while calls about loud parties in public spaces jumped to 9,013 from 3,338.\n\nReports of people with knives in the transit system have increased 139% in the same time period, according to the NYPD. Calls about subway drug sales jumped by 71%.\n\n“You’re not going to walk into Duane Reade and take whatever you want and walk out,” Adams said. “You’re not going to hop over the counter and take codeine and other drugs… You’re not going to drive motorcycles through the streets, pulling people out and assaulting them merely because of a traffic accident. You’re not going to openly inject yourself with drugs. You’re not going to just do whatever you want in the city.”\n\n‘We won’t go back to abusive policing’\n\nWhen major crimes in New York City spiked nearly 60% in February compared to the same month in 2021, Adams announced a plan to combat gun violence, crime and homelessness in the subways. Advocates accused the city of criminalizing homelessness.\n\nCrime in New York reached historic lows over the past three decades before numbers started to go up in 2020 – a trend that has continued over the last two years and mirrors what is happening in big cities around the country.\n\nPart of the mayor’s response was to bring back the NYPD’s controversial anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country. The unit has been rebranded as Neighborhood Safety Teams tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods.\n\nOn Monday, after another weekend plagued by gun violence, Adams announced the deployment of five additional Neighborhood Safety Teams (NST) across the city. They will work with patrol officers in a more proactive role expanding duties beyond 911 calls.\n\nThe first plainclothes teams, the mayor said, were deployed a week earlier and conducted more than 30 arrests in neighborhoods with 80% of the city’s gun violence. Ten of those arrests were for gun possession. The others involved drug sales, suspended or revoked licenses and criminal possession of a knife.\n\nAdams, a former NYPD lieutenant, insisted this week that the NYPD is not resurrecting the broken windows approach but bolstering public safety while ensuring civil liberties.\n\n“We are not going back to the policing that I fought to change,” said Adams, noting that video technology will be used to monitor the behavior of officers.\n\n“We won’t go back to abusive policing,” he added.\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the union representing rank-and-file members of the NYPD, voiced support.\n\n“We will do our part to confront these quality-of-life issues,” Lynch said in a statement. “Our communities have been pleading with us to put an end to the lawlessness.”\n\n‘Association between urban blight and crime’\n\nMiami Beach imposed a midnight spring break curfew after two shootings left five people injured. Courtesy Mitch Novick\n\nOther cities around the country also are dealing with not only the third year of a pandemic but also responding to the deadly crisis of gun violence.\n\nIn Detroit, Police Chief James White this week released a 244-page community safety strategy in response to an increase in violent crime that jumped 13% in 2020 compared to the previous year. In 2021, violent crime increased by just 3%, according to the police department.\n\nThe goal of the plan is to reduce violent crime by 10% in part by focusing on quality-of-life issues such as large, loud gatherings and public consumption of drugs and alcohol. The department will also use body-worn cameras to monitor the interactions of officers with the public.\n\n“There is an association between urban blight and crime, including violent crime,” the document said. “We want to continue reducing violent crime in neighborhoods by closely monitoring vacant lots and abandoned or neglected buildings.”\n\nIn Miami Beach, the city commission voted on Tuesday to impose a curfew during spring break this weekend. Some nighttime alcohol sales were banned. The dramatic move and emergency order came after five people were injured in two shootings on Miami Beach’s iconic Ocean Drive last weekend.\n\n“I’m at my wit’s end trying to figure out how to be able to deal with this crowd, with the numbers that are here, and with what we are encountering during the policing of this particular event,” Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Clements told commissioners at an emergency meeting.\n\nSince the spring break season began in February, nine officers have been injured in some capacity, Clements said.\n\nAsher, the crime analyst, questioned the strategy.\n\n“Instituting a curfew is unlikely to have much of an effect on violence,” he said. “You’re basically removing witnesses, removing people from the streets. If you have a curfew it plausibly could lead to more crime and more shootings because people feel freer to act more brazen. There’s little evidence that something like a curfew is going to have an effect.”\n\n‘We’ve tried this before’\n\nAsher said homicides have risen more than 5% in 99 US cities so far this year – to 1,313 compared to 1,248 during the same period in 2021. But he cautioned against drawing conclusions from the numbers in March, noting that the summer and fall data provide a clearer picture of the national trend.\n\n“It is clear the police can curb violence in the short run or crime in the short run,” said Cornell University criminal justice expert Jamein Cunningham. “But then the question is at what cost? That’s the policy question. I don’t think we have a really good answer.”\n\nCunningham and other experts acknowledge that policing aimed at high-crime areas is effective in the short term. But they warn of high costs from further straining relations with communities of color while ignoring social services and neighborhood programs.\n\nWong, the Legal Aid attorney, said a return of more confrontational practices, particularly in marginalized communities, undermines the reforms and other small gains brought about by the protest movement after Floyd’s death.\n\n“We’re coming off the heels of nationwide protests calling for police accountability for police brutality,” she said.\n\n“Many of those encounters were because of broken windows policing… You never see a police department apply broken windows policing to themselves when it comes to accountability and transparency for their own misconduct. We’ve tried this before. Why are we doing it again if it didn’t work?”", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez Mark Morales", "Ray Sanchez", "Mark Morales"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/us/nypd-anti-crime-unit-eric-adams/index.html", "title": "The NYPD has resurrected its controversial anti-crime unit.

High-profile shootings by plainclothes officers undermined the legitimacy and perception of both the unit and the notion of plainclothes policing in New York. But Adams, who made public safety a key part of his campaign for mayor and touted his history as an NYPD captain as evidence he’s uniquely suited for tackling crime, said better training and oversight will help the city keep the unit’s troubled lineage in its past.\n\n“In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,” Adams said at a press conference announcing a multi-layered plan for fighting crime that also includes investing in community violence prevention and intervention programs. “These officers will be identifiable as NYPD, they will have body cameras, and they will have enhanced training and oversight.”\n\nNew York City is not unique: Cities across the country have units of plainclothes officers assigned to high-risk policing efforts, and though their assignments vary by city, they’re similar in many ways. They’re usually identifiable, unlike undercovers. They’re typically in unmarked cars and not responsible for answering 911 calls, are assigned hours and locations depending on crime concerns, and their mandate is guns or other felony enforcement. And in other cities, they’re also associated with aggressive policing.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a group of officers, deputies, detectives that I can pull and use to prevent and combat a problem they may be having in a certain area,” said Florida’s Orange County Sheriff John W. Mina, who also served as Chief of the Orlando Police Department.\n\n“Here we just had a series of shootings in an area that has been a challenge for years but we were able to divert resources because they’re not tied to just answering calls. And it works. It works. They make a lot of good cases, a lot of good arrests. Put a lot of bad people away to help solve the issue.”\n\nMayor Eric Adams speaks at the 32nd Precinct at a vigil for the two officers shot last week in Harlem. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPlainclothes officers have a checkered history\n\nCritics are quick to point to a checkered history of plainclothes officers in New York – including the three high-profile deaths of Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell and Eric Garner – and a reputation for aggressive policing and abuse of power.\n\nThe biggest problem with the anti-crime unit was the civilian complaints they racked up, said Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n“You’re going after people who’ve committed violent crimes, and firearms, you’re going to get that reaction because you’re not going to be right every time you jump out of the car,” Giacalone said. “That’s just the cost of doing business … If you’re involved in active policing, you’re going to get (complaints).”\n\nData provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the watchdog agency charged with oversight of the NYPD, show the unit garnered lots of complaints over the years. They had 430 complaints in 2019 and 428 in 2018, though the vast majority of those allegations were not proven, the data shows. Officials with CCRB have also said in the past that plainclothes officers were much harder to identify because they were sometimes not wearing badges or name tags and that would lead to unsubstantiated claims.\n\nCCRB Executive Director Darius Charney, whose agency investigates racial profiling and biased policing allegations, said there must be real oversight for the unit to avoid problems that dogged this unit in the past.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the past, the history shows us that these plainclothes officers were really some of the worst offenders when it came to abusive and discriminatory policing,” Charney said. “And I think a lot of that had to do with not only how they were trained or what incentives they were given, but also there was just really a lack of oversight and accountability for officers who did break the law or violate people’s rights.”\n\nThe casket of New York City police officer Wilbert Mora is carried out of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Wednesday, February 2.

In all, five New York City Police officers have been shot in the first three weeks of the year.\n\nThe mayor’s plan calls for the new teams to be deployed to 30 of the city’s 77 precincts and housing units that are responsible for 80% of violence in the city.\n\nThe NYPD is vetting candidates for the teams now, Adams said.\n\n“We’re going to make sure the 400 plus people that are in the pipeline to go into our new unit … that they’re the best fit for the unit,” Adams said.\n\n“We must make sure we don’t continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,” Adams said during a speech, following the shooting of the two officers. “I’m going to get my cops to do their job. I need the rest of the country that are in positions of authority to do their job.”\n\nMina said that when he supervised teams in Orlando, he sought officers who could work with minimal supervision and showed they were productive with self-initiated activity.\n\n“They’ve already put together cases, shown an aptitude for writing search warrants. Finding people with guns. Or recruiting (confidential informants),” he said.\n\nElite team was involved in the death of Diallo\n\nThe NYPD’s anti-crime unit existed for decades, and was staffed and directed at the precinct level, meant to respond to concerns within those boundaries and staffed by police officers familiar with the people and places in the precinct.\n\nPromotion to NYPD’s detective squads typically ran through the anti-crime unit, though that’s not always the case in other cities. Promising or ambitious young officers with a few years working uniformed patrol – or those with older relatives or political connections on the job – would ask into NYPD anti-crime and work there for a couple years before doing 18 months or two years of detective work and earning a detective shield, Giacalone said\n\nOnce NYPD officers were selected for the anti-crime units, they were sent to training and worked their new assignment in plainclothes. They were expected to go after guns and people carrying them (referred to as “the gun police” by some residents), so they carried less equipment on their belts than uniformed officers and weren’t required to wear a uniform because of the expectation of getting into foot chases, Giacalone said.\n\nWhile the NYPD had its precinct-level anti-crime units, the department also staffed a more elite “street crime” unit whose main focus was getting guns. They were also plainclothes and in unmarked cars. In 1999, four officers from that unit fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx home.\n\nDiallo was struck 19 times and was killed. The officers, who were later acquitted of murder charges, said they confused his wallet for a gun. The entire unit was eventually disbanded in response to Diallo’s death, and the work they did became the responsibility of the anti-crime units which long operated at the precinct, borough and city levels.\n\n‘Supervision is a good thing’\n\nThe Bronx vestibule where Amadou Diallo was shot and killed by members of New York City's elite 'street crime' unit. Richard Harbus/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nControversy over the years, including drug and money related corruption scandals, led to changes and tighter supervision within plainclothes units. This happened as views on policing continued to evolve across the country and cities started seeing an influx of drugs, drug money, and street violence and police corruption related to both.\n\nAfter the Diallo shooting, the NYPD’s anti-crime unit’s focus remained on guns and violence. Then, in June 2020, then NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that he disbanded all levels of the anti-crime unit, sending roughly 200 members to the detective bureau and spreading others out to different units.\n\nThe move to disband the unit followed protests, in New York and across the country, over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Other cities, in the wake of protests, reexamined their staffing and the utility of proactive policing. But the move in New York was reversed within about two months, as shootings in New York City spiked following the protests. The teams returned as Public Safety Teams, working unmarked cars but in full uniform, city officials have said.\n\nThe NYPD’s teams were typically composed of three officers and a sergeant working shifts that extend into the evening or overnight. In other parts of policing, in other cities and in patrol, sergeants will typically oversee a larger number of officers, from six to 10. Part of the reason for greater supervision, Giacalone said, was to prevent corruption.\n\nMina, who worked in and supervised a similar unit in the Orlando Police Department and whose department now has a similar unit, said that more supervision in high-risk situations was beneficial for everyone.\n\n“If it’s always wanted people you’re going after, or people known to carry guns, you’re going to want the span of control to be tighter so you can manage and supervise what’s going on,” Mina said. “Making sure you’re safe, the public’s safe, and making sure the bad guy is safe and situations can be peacefully resolved. Supervision is a good thing.”\n\nTwo points of contention – the lack of a uniform and the unmarked vehicles – came to represent, to critics, bad policing and unwarranted aggression. The officers in the new unit won’t wear uniforms but will wear jackets with police insignia, a slight departure from the past where officers were required to wear the shield identifying themselves as officers outside their outermost layer of clothing.\n\n“In many communities, that is a sign that you’re about to be attacked,” Adams said about plainclothes cops jumping out of their car. “That has created a lot of hostility. We are going to make sure that the version of plainclothes officers will have modified police attire so that they are quickly identified as police officers.\n\n‘Real accountability’ is necessary\n\nAccording to experts, for the most part, unmarked cars and officers in baseball caps and oversized shirts weren’t fooling anyone, but it’s a common defense for someone who runs from the police that they didn’t know the person chasing them was an officer. And the reason for a lighter duty belt was for it to be easier to give chase.\n\n“Defense attorneys are gonna do what they do … What are they going to say, (their client) knew he was the police and ran? You could be wearing a clown outfit and (the defense attorney) would say (their client) didn’t know it was a clown,” Giacalone said.\n\nMina said unmarked cars, especially at night, can buy an officer a few seconds of advantage. Being able to get a little closer, or evading detection for even a couple more seconds, is sometimes all an officer needs to capture someone evading custody.\n\n“If you’re standing there (selling drugs), you’re not going to throw dope or run every time you see a car that’s not marked. They’re looking, don’t get me wrong. And in some cases, we catch ‘em sleeping, not paying attention. But it buys you a few more seconds,” he said. “The idea is they get just a little bit closer than a marked unit, and sometimes even a second or two is helpful … you’re not fooling anyone but it will get you a little closer and buy you a second or two of hesitation.”\n\nThe units also came to be associated with NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy. Stop-and-frisk, where police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious, had been used to deter crime, law enforcement officials have said in the past in defense of the tactic. But it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops.\n\nIn August 2013, a federal judge ruled that stop-and-frisk violated the Constitution and ordered the city to develop remedies, including a federal monitor overseeing the NYPD.\n\nCharney, now with the CCRB, was the plaintiff’s attorney in the landmark stop-and-frisk case that ended the practice in New York. It was the same case where Mayor Adams – then a state senator, testified that he had a sit-down with then New York Gov. David Paterson and the NYPD commissioner at the time, Ray Kelly, regarding a stop-and-frisk bill.\n\nAdams testified that Kelly said the policy targeted Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately, “because he wanted to instill fear in them, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by police,” according to court records. Kelly denied that assertion.\n\n“I think this time around, we really need to learn from the lessons of the past and make sure that there is going to be real accountability and oversight for these officers. And frankly, any officers in the police department,” Charney said.\n\nGiacalone said Adams’ first test will come with the unit’s first high-profile use of force.\n\n“When something goes bad, and always something will happen … whether a situation goes sideways, or there’s a questionable shooting, going after people with guns and violent crimes, things will happen. Does Adams have the stomach to deal with what comes next? That’s the whole thing.”", "authors": ["Mark Morales Peter Nickeas", "Mark Morales", "Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/953102/operation-trojan-shield-anom-messaging-app-sting-800-criminals-arrested", "title": "Operation Trojan Shield: 800 criminals arrested in global FBI ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

Sign up\n\nInside the sting\n\nThe seeds of Operation Trojan Shield were sown in 2017, when “the FBI in San Diego began investigating a secure messaging system” – named “Phantom Secure” – that was “being marketed exclusively to organised crime groups”, The Telegraph says.\n\nVincent Ramos, the CEO of Phantom Secure, was arrested in Las Vegas in 2019, leaving what police in New Zealand have described as “a significant void in the encrypted communication market”. “At this point”, The Telegraph says, “an anonymous informant… offered up his or her new tech to investigators”. And instead of “waiting for criminals to fill the niche, the FBI decided to enter the market themselves”.\n\nThe sting operation got under way in 2019, when the FBI began covertly operating the encrypted device network ANOM, before spreading devices with the chat app installed on them throughout the criminal underworld through a series of informants.\n\n“ANOM devices were cellphones that had been stripped of all normal functions”, The New York Times (NYT) reports. They had just one working app “disguised as the calculator function”, allowing “users to send messages and photos with end-to-end encryption”.\n\nAccessing the ANOM network required entering a code provided by another user and the phones could only be used to message other ANOM phones. They sold on the black market for around $2,000 (£1,400).\n\nDuring the three-year operation, around 12,000 encrypted devices were distributed throughout more than 300 criminal syndicates in over 100 countries, Europol says, giving police an insight into “Italian organised crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs and international drug trafficking organisations”.\n\n“Users trusted the devices’ security so much that they often laid out their plans not in code, but in plain language”, the NYT says. But “unbeknown to them” they were actually falling foul of an operation of “unprecedented scope” that saw the FBI and 16 other countries exploit the intelligence.\n\nThe “biggest and most sophisticated crime sting in history” saw various police forces manage to put the phones “into the hands of some of the most influential crime bosses on the planet”, The Telegraph says.\n\nAustralian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the operation, unwittingly recommending the app to his associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, Australian police said.\n\nAnd after pulling off the “immense technological craft” needed to coordinate the sting, “the pay-off from the coordinated global raids announced on Tuesday was enormous”, The Telegraph adds.\n\nGlobal raids\n\nPolice in at least 16 countries including Australia, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Norway, New Zealand, Britain, Germany and the United States were involved in a series of coordinated raids yesterday.\n\nThe UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said it carried out “multiple operations” as part of Operation Trojan Shield. A spokesperson said the agency “conducted multiple operations targeting organised crime groups involved in drug trafficking and money laundering”.\n\n“This operation has demonstrated that, in the face of the rapidly evolving threat from criminals exploiting the fast expansion of technology, the NCA is committed to working across international borders to target organised criminals, wherever they are and however they communicate”, it added.\n\n“Australian police said they had disrupted 21 murder plots and seized 3.7 tonnes of drugs during the operation”, the Financial Times reports, adding that “9,000 officers had taken part” in raids this week culminating in “224 arrests in Australia and 35 in New Zealand”.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: “The Australian government, as part of a global operation, has struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world.”\n\nSwedish police said they had “thwarted at least 10 murders and arrested 155 suspects”, including several “leading figures in the criminal network, who have had a major influence in the drugs market, and at the same time have ordered violent acts in the form of, for instance, shootings”, The Telegraph reports.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany, “70 people were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in drugs and weapons and 150 properties were raided across the country”, the paper adds. Local officials said Finnish police made almost 100 arrests, while 49 people were detained in the Netherlands.\n\nThe FBI did not break down the number of arrests for each country, however, the bureau unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM devices. “Eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run”, the BBC says.\n\nThe ANOM app is still operational. But as of Tuesday it had switched its previous tagline – “enforce your right to privacy” – for a new message inviting users to “discuss how your account has been linked to an ongoing investigation” by entering their account details, the NYT adds.", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Theara Coleman", "Rebekah Evans", "Felicity Capon", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/us/uvalde-police-consequences-texas-shooting/index.html", "title": "Texas shooting: Uvalde officers involved in school massacre may ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe release this week of 82 minutes of school surveillance video from the May massacre in Uvalde, Texas, is fueling scrutiny over what, if any, consequences officers might face for their decision to retreat from gunfire and wait an hour to confront the shooter inside the school where he killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers.\n\nThe much-anticipated Texas House Investigative Committee’s preliminary report into the most deadly American school shooting in nearly a decade is expected soon, though it’s not clear how wide-ranging the panel’s work has been or what might result from its probe.\n\nSo far, the person said to have been in charge during the May 24 shooting – the school district’s police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo – has been slammed by the slain children’s parents, local elected leaders and fellow law enforcement officials who claim he failed to follow training and wrongly delayed entry for more than an hour into the classroom where officers killed the gunman. Armed officers from several agencies milled about while the gunman was free to move around adjoining classrooms, the video published by the Austin American-Statesman shows.\n\nArredondo – who’s said he neither considered himself the incident commander nor instructed officers to refrain from breaching the scene – resigned the Uvalde City Council seat he assumed just a week after the attack. But formal repercussions for him – and any others from at least eight agencies involved in the police response – remain largely elusive.\n\nThe consequences could be criminal, administrative or civil. But varying standards in each of these jurisdictions and conflicting rules governing investigations reflect “a persistent problem in police accountability,” said Seth Stoughton, professor of law at the University of South Carolina.\n\n“It’s not just this case – it’s in many cases.” Competing priorities, he said, might pit whether it’s “more important to figure out what happened or to figure how to avoid it in the future. Or more to hold an officer individually liable in some way, criminally or civilly. They can run right smack into each other.”\n\nAlso investigating the attack at Robb Elementary School is the Texas Department of Public Safety. But publicly, at least, it’s unclear precisely which facets of the incident it’s delving into and which standards it’s trying to uphold – to say nothing of what the probe might yield. Similar questions linger over inquiries other agencies might be undertaking.\n\nThe Department of Justice also is investigating the shooting, aiming to “provide this definitive, independent accounting,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in June on C-SPAN. The review “is not a criminal investigation,” she added.\n\nMany of at least eight agencies whose officers responded to the school that day haven’t responded to CNN’s requests for comment. Others have declined to answer questions about their role in the emergency response.\n\nOfficials’ repeated revisions in the case narrative since the hours immediately after the attack have made a true and full understanding of the law enforcement response impossible so far. And given the fraught backdrop of American gun violence against which the facts are unfolding, it’s unclear what consequences may result.\n\nStill, what’s known in this case and of general policing standards suggest this is what the fallout for officers could look like:\n\nCriminal charges for failure to act unlikely, experts say\n\nThe crux of the police response that’s captured utmost public attention is the time that passed with the shooter alive in the school: at least 70 minutes.\n\nIt’s unlikely criminal charges would be filed against responding officers – and more unlikely they would stick – over alleged inaction or allegations they didn’t quickly enough kill the shooter, Stoughton told CNN.\n\nProsecutors have discretion in filing charges, so it’s not impossible, but the bar is high for criminal accountability for inaction.\n\n“We only punish an omission – a failure to do something – when there’s a specific legal requirement, a legal duty, for someone to do what they’ve failed to do,” Stoughton said. “Here, what we’re looking for is legal duty that required officers to go in earlier than they did. And I’m not aware of one.”\n\nAfter the Parkland, Florida, high school massacre, a prosecutor charged an officer under a state “caregiver” law for an alleged failure to act during the shooting that left 17 dead. He has pleaded not guilty to seven counts, with a trial set for 2023.\n\n“The caretaker statute applies to teachers: They have to affirmatively safeguard (the) well-being of kids. Because he’s a school resource officer, the prosecutor is arguing the statute that applies to caregivers counts because he’s, arguing (the officer) is in position like a teacher,” Stoughton said.\n\n“It is a bit of a stretch,” he allowed, “and we don’t even have that” in the Uvalde case.\n\nIndeed, it’s not clear if any particular law in Texas would have obligated such an officer to act in any specific way, he said. It’s also not clear if any prosecutor is considering insufficient action by law enforcement.\n\nAs to finding criminal fault with officers’ actions that day, prosecutors are in a “really difficult position,” said Carol Archbold, chair of the criminal justice department at North Dakota State University.\n\n“The odds are slim that they would actually bring charges and have the charges stick,” she said. “This is involving children, loss of life of children, which is tragic. … There’s something that sparks outrage or an outcry for accountability from the public because it’s involving children.\n\n“So, prosecutors are put in a position where they have to obviously follow the law but at the same time have to deal with balancing public opinion or outcry,” she told CNN.\n\nScope of administrative reviews is unclear\n\nWhen an officer fires their gun or responds to a chaotic mass-casualty incident, police departments typically conduct internal reviews or invite third parties to do so, with their sights set on determining whether departmental rules were followed before and after the event and the roles each officer played. Most police departments also have broad “conduct unbecoming” rules, and agencies may also have specific active-shooter protocols or other written standards.\n\n“Conduct unbecoming” clauses typically would be the easiest way for an agency to discipline officers, Stoughton said.\n\n“In some ways, that’s the easiest to imagine in a case like this because all they have to do to be administratively liable, sanctioned or disciplined is violate policies or training,” he said. “And even if no specific policy that says go in there get active shooter, they can say, ‘Look … you’re trained to do a thing, you didn’t do that thing, you didn’t do what you’re expected to do.’”\n\nBut even that depends on whether lower-ranking officers were ordered to wait, he said.\n\nWhile it’s not clear what type of training or orders regarding active shooter incidents each Uvalde responding agency has, consequences in general for violating such law enforcement rules range from a verbal scolding to being fired. Disciplinary processes usually give officers a chance to contest allegations. And even termination can be uncertain: At least one deputy who responded to the Parkland school massacre and was fired for inaction got his job back after his union contested the firings.\n\nArredondo, for his part, was placed on administrative leave June 22.\n\nWhile much of the public focus after the Uvalde mass shooting has been on whether officers moved quickly enough into the classroom where some eventually killed the shooter, administrative reviews also could look at whether officers followed training and orders before going in and how they handled information and evidence afterward.\n\nAt least three federal, two state and three local agencies responded to the carnage at Robb Elementary – but it’s not clear which may be conducting such investigations or their status.\n\n“It’s good that you have different set of eyes looking at the case because they’re likely to find something another agency or individual didn’t find,” Archbold said.\n\n“I’m not really sure what’s going to happen or how long it will take, but given so many people are looking, at some point we’re going to learn what happened,” Archbold said. “It just may not be quickly.”\n\nMeantime, an examination of who’s looking at what reveals a tangle of interests: The district attorney’s investigator in Uvalde County, for instance, was part of the police response on May 24, along with the state police agency – the Texas Department of Public Safety – which is handling the broader criminal investigation. And the state legislative committee is relying on testimony from department personnel in producing its report.\n\nIt’s not clear if those two agencies are subject to any outside scrutiny that could result in administrative accountability or whether there are internal investigations into their officers’ conduct that day. The county district attorney declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers didn’t respond to a request for comment. Spokespersons for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department, the school district itself and the Uvalde Police Department also didn’t respond.\n\nThe Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University is producing after-action reports with the “explicit purpose of identifying training gaps to be addressed by police officers across the state of Texas.” But it’s not clear whether any agencies with officers on scene that day will use those reports in seeking administrative action against officers. The agency trains first responders across the country in response to “active attack situations.”\n\nCivil lawsuits mean a high bar for plaintiffs\n\nCivil litigation may be another way families of victims could seek accountability.\n\nSo far, a state legislator in Texas has sued for access to public records related to the mass shooting, and the families of four victims have sued the estate of the shooter. It appears no lawsuits have been filed against law enforcement in which the claim relates to the quality of the police response, though a San Antonio attorney said in late June he plans to file such a suit by mid-July.\n\nIf they’re sued, agencies could settle in a way that shields them from having to make any public statements about their role in responding to the shooting. But if government agencies fight any suits, the bar for holding officers liable for inaction would be high, Stoughton said.\n\nIt isn’t just that officers didn’t act, he said: They had to have made it worse.\n\n“These are really tough cases, though, because the standard the Supreme Court has set for failure to protect is that police – government generally, but here, police – the only legal duty to protect is when police themselves create the danger or make it worse.” Stoughton said.\n\nNot acting – in this case, not confronting the gunman sooner – isn’t typically sufficient for a civil claim to result favorably for the plaintiff, he said.\n\nGrieving Uvalde families have condemned police as “cowards,” and parents have expressed worries about children who survived but couldn’t save their friends. But it’s not clear if those conclusions would be enough to yield a win in court against a police agency.\n\n“The easy way to understand this is: Did police create the danger or make the existing danger worse?” he said. “Not just did they allow it to occur, but did they make it worse?”\n\nFederal review aims for ‘lessons learned’\n\nWhile the Department of Justice is helping local authorities investigate the massacre by providing expertise and processing evidence, the goal of its “Critical Incident Review” is to document “lessons learned and best practices” for first responders.\n\n“I want to be clear: This is not a criminal investigation,” Gupta said in June. “Obviously, the department has criminal investigative authority, and we prosecute officers for violating the law when that happens, but this is an after-action review, which is another tool that the department has … to be able to provide a definitive accounting.”\n\nThe federal agency will look at video and other evidence to “reconstruct the timeline,” looking at what happened before, during and after the massacre to “provide this definitive, independent accounting,” she said, reiterating: “It is not a criminal investigation.”", "authors": ["Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/30/police-pursuits-fatal-injuries/30187827/", "title": "High-speed police chases have killed thousands of innocent ...", "text": "Thomas Frank, USA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story used an incorrect first name for Maj. Travis Yates\n\nMore than 5,000 bystanders and passengers have been killed in police car chases since 1979, and tens of thousands more were injured as officers repeatedly pursued drivers at high speeds and in hazardous conditions, often for minor infractions, a USA TODAY analysis shows.\n\nThe bystanders and the passengers in chased cars account for nearly half of all people killed in police pursuits from 1979 through 2013, USA TODAY found. Most bystanders were killed in their own cars by a fleeing driver.\n\nPolice across the USA chase tens of thousands of people each year -- usually for traffic violations or misdemeanors -- often causing drivers to speed away recklessly. Recent cases show the danger of the longstanding police practice of chasing minor offenders.\n\nA 25-year-old New Jersey man was killed July 18 by a driver police chased for running a red light.\n\nA 63-year-old Indianapolis grandmother was killed June 7 by a driver police chased four miles for shoplifting.\n\nA 60-year-old federal worker was killed March 19 near Washington, D.C., by a driver police chased because his headlights were off.\n\n\"The police shouldn't have been chasing him. That was a big crowded street,\" said Evelyn Viverette, 83, mother of federal worker Charlie Viverette. \"He wouldn't have hit my son if the police hadn't been chasing him.\"\n\nSome police say drivers who flee are suspicious, and chasing them maintains law and order. \"When crooks think they can do whatever they choose, that will just fester and foster more crimes,\" said Milwaukee Police Detective Michael Crivello, who is president of the city's police union.\n\nMany in law enforcement, including the Justice Department, have recognized the danger of high-speed chases and urge officers to avoid or abort pursuits that endanger pedestrians, nearby motorists or themselves. At least 139 police have been killed in chases, federal records show.\n\n\"A pursuit is probably the most unique and dangerous job law enforcement can do,\" said Tulsa Police Maj. Travis Yates, who runs a national pursuit-training academy.\n\nThe Justice Department called pursuits \"the most dangerous of all ordinary police activities\" in 1990 and urged police departments to adopt policies listing exactly when officers can and cannot pursue someone. \"Far more police vehicle chases occur each year than police shootings,\" the department said.\n\nPolice chases have killed nearly as many people as justifiable police shootings, according to government figures, which are widely thought to under count fatal shootings. Yet chases have escaped the national attention paid to other potentially lethal police tactics.\n\nDespite the Justice Department's warning, the number of chase-related deaths in 2013 was higher than the number in 1990 — 322 compared to 317, according to records of the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which analyzes all fatal motor-vehicle crashes.\n\nMany police departments still let officers make on-the-spot judgments about whether to chase based on their perception of a driver's danger to the public. Officers continue to violate pursuit policies concerning when to avoid or stop a chase, police records show. And federally funded high-tech systems that would obviate chases, such as vehicle tracking devices, are undeveloped or rarely used due to cost.\n\nWhile cities such as Milwaukee and Orlando allow chases only of suspected violent felons, many departments let officers chase anyone if they decide the risk of letting someone go free outweighs the risk of a pursuit.\n\nAt least 11,506 people, including 6,300 fleeing suspects, were killed in police chases from 1979 through 2013, most recent year for which NHTSA records are available. That's an average of 329 a year — nearly one person a day.\n\nBut those figures likely understate the actual death toll because NHTSA uses police reports to determine if a crash was chase-related, and some reports do not disclose that a chase occurred.\n\nKansas, Michigan and Minnesota state records all show more chase-related deaths than NHTSA shows for those states.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment,\" said Geoffrey Alpert of the University of South Carolina, a leading researcher on police pursuits who has done numerous Justice Department studies. NHTSA records \"are the only national database we have on these fatalities, and it's been consistently wrong.\"\n\nThe number of innocent bystanders killed is impossible to pinpoint because hundreds of NHTSA's records fail to show whether a victim was killed in a car fleeing police or in a car that happened to be hit during a chase.\n\nAnalyzing each fatal crash, USA TODAY determined that at least 2,456 bystanders were killed, although the death toll could be as high as 2,750. The newspaper found that 55% of those killed were drivers fleeing police. They ranged from armed-robbery suspects to a 10-year-old boy chased as he drove a pick-up truck 85 mph on a county road before hitting a tree, killing himself and his 7-year-old passenger.\n\nInjuries are even harder to count because NHTSA keeps records of only fatal crashes.\n\nHowever, records from six states show that 17,600 people were hurt in chases from 2004 through 2013 — an average of 1,760 injuries a year in those states, which make up 24% of the U.S. population.\n\nThose numbers suggest that chases nationwide may have injured 7,400 people a year — more than 270,000 people since 1979.\n\nThe uncertainty about the death and injury tolls obscures the danger of police chases, said Jonathan Farris, who became an advocate for pursuit safety after his son Paul, 23, was killed in 2007 by a motorist being chased for an illegal driving maneuver. \"If the public understood the number of pursuits that were going on and the number of people who were being injured or killed, there would be a much better dialogue as to what types of crimes should be pursued,\" Farris said.\n\nAlthough police-camera footage often depicts the drama of squad cars racing after motorists, most chases begin benignly, with an attempted traffic stop. And most end quickly — 76% were over within five minutes, according to records of tens of thousands of chases in California.\n\nCalifornia records of 63,500 chases from 2002 through 2014 show that:\n\nMore than 89% were for vehicle-code violations, including speeding, vehicle theft, reckless driving, and 4,898 instances of a missing license plate or an expired registration\n\nJust 5% were an attempt to nab someone suspected of a violent crime, usually assault or robbery; 168 sought a known murder suspect\n\nNearly 1,000 were for safety violations that endangered a driver only, including 850 drivers not wearing a seat belt and 23 motorcycle riders not wearing a helmet\n\nIn 90 instances, police chased someone for driving too slowly\n\n\"We don't know that the person in that car is just speeding or just had a headlight out ... [or] if they had just committed a felony,\" said Joseph Farrow, commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, which chased 14,628 motorists from 2007 through 2014, resulting in 4,052 crashes, 2,198 injuries and 103 deaths.\n\nThat's a 28% crash rate and a 15% injury rate.\n\nMinnesota safety researchers found in 2008 that 35% to 40% of chases resulted in a crash.\n\n\"There's no question that when you're engaging in a chase, you're engaging in something that can turn out many ways, and many are bad outcomes,\" said John Firman of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, whose survey of 17,000 chases nationally since 2001 shows that 92% began for a traffic violation, misdemeanor or non-violent felony such as car theft.\n\nPolice often suspect fleeing drivers are wanted for a serious offense. And they dislike letting a violator get away. During a chase police can be overcome by \"a need to 'win' and make the arrest,\" which blinds them to the danger they are helping create, a 2010 FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin reported.\n\n\"These are folks who are proud and who see their job as going out and putting the bad guy in jail,\" said Assistant Chief Randall Blankenbaker of the Dallas Police Department, which sharply restricts chases.\n\nWhen police in Beech Grove, Ind., were called June 8 at 8:07 a.m. about a shoplifting from a Walmart, they pulled behind the suspect's car in a parking lot and flashed their emergency lights. Driver Matthew Edmonds allegedly sped off on a busy thoroughfare, with police chasing for four miles until stopping because of the danger. Moments later, Edmonds allegedly sped through an intersection and hit a pick-up truck driven by 63-year-old Donna Niblock, killing her and seriously injuring her daughter and 11-year-old grandson.\n\nThe chase followed department guidelines, which allow \"high-risk\" pursuits for drivers suspected of property crimes, Beech Grove Detective Capt. Robert Mercuri said.\n\n\"We don't know who may be in that vehicle. We don't know if they have somebody tied up in the back seat,\" Mercuri said. \"It could have been Ted Bundy.\"\n\nFew drivers fleeing police are wanted felons, according to statistics and research. Most committed minor offenses and \"made very bad decisions to flee,\" a 2008 paper by the Police Foundation said.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, records of 32,000 chases since 1997 show that the most common charge against fleeing drivers was theft, including stealing or illegally possessing the car they were driving. The other most-frequent charges were resisting arrest, underage drinking and misdemeanor assault.\n\nA Justice Department-funded 1998 study found after interviewing fleeing drivers that 32% drove off because they were in a stolen car, 27% because they had a suspended driver's license, 27% wanted to avoid arrest and 21% because they were driving drunk.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly, someone is fleeing because they've got a minor warrant, their car isn't insured, they've had too much to drink,\" said Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, who sharply restricted his department's pursuits in 2010 after four bystanders were killed in a three-month span.\n\nFor more serious offenses such as stealing a vehicle, \"the sanctions imposed by courts nationwide for merely stealing a car don't justify anybody taking any risk,\" Flynn said.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, at 3:20 p.m., Austin, Texas, police chased a driver in a stolen pickup truck at 90 to 95 mph onto a highway and along a frontage road lined with service stations and fast-food restaurants. At an intersection, the truck slammed into a Mitsubishi driven by James Williford, 32, killing him instantly.\n\nDriver Reynaldo Hernandez was convicted of murdering Williford and sentenced to 55 years. The Austin police chief cleared the two officers, saying they followed the policy of the department, which had been cracking down on auto thefts.\n\nWilliford's widow Esther Seoanes holds the officers responsible for deciding to chase a stolen car.\n\n\"My husband,\" Seoanes said, \"was essentially killed for a stolen vehicle.\"\n\n\"The moment the officer crossed over the median with lights and sirens and started the pursuit, he (Hernandez) immediately turned into one of those criminals and suspects who doesn't care about anything,\" said Seoanes, executive director of PursuitSAFETY, a nonprofit seeking to reduce chase-related deaths. \"Drivers, they don't care about anyone's safety, and so the burden falls on the police to protect the public.\"\n\nAustin police declined to comment due to Seoanes' pending lawsuit against them.\n\nSome relatives of killed bystanders don't hold police responsible for deaths in chases.\n\n\"I'm not blaming the police,\" Nicole Jackson of Detroit said after a driver who allegedly had a gun sped away from police on June 24 and killed Jackson's granddaughter and grandson, age 3 and 6, while they were riding scooters near their home. \"I'm blaming the person who did all this.\"\n\nChases are inherently dangerous because of their speed, and police often compound the danger by chasing drivers in hazardous conditions.\n\nAt least 3,440 people were killed in crashes when a driver was fleeing at 25 mph or more over the speed limit, NHTSA records show. The actual death toll from such high-speed chases is likely much higher, but is not known because only half of NHTSA's records show a fleeing driver's speed and the speed limit.\n\nParticularly dangerous are chases on wet or icy roads, and pursuits of inexperienced and risk-prone teen-age drivers and of motorcyclists, who have little crash protection.\n\nIn Michigan over the past decade, 74% of motorcyclists fleeing police were killed, injured or possibly injured when they crashed, state records show. Just 18% of chased car drivers were killed, injured or possibly injured in a crash.\n\nPolice departments routinely warn officers about hazardous road conditions and high-risk drivers. Some bar motorcycle cops from pursuits because of the danger if an officer crashes.\n\nYet nearly one-third of the police-chase deaths involved one of those three high-risk factors, USA TODAY found.\n\nThat includes 1,132 motorcyclists who were killed while being chased. More than half — 589 — were not wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Most police departments don't allow their motorcycles to be in pursuits, so why would you chase one?\" said Alpert, the South Carolina researcher. \"Motorcycle drivers are either going to get away or they're going to get killed.\"\n\nMichigan State Police must consider \"road and weather conditions\" in deciding whether to chase, and can pursue only people suspected of a \"life-threatening felony\" or drivers who pose \"an immediate threat to the safety of the public.\" The policy cautions, \"It is better to either delay the arrest or abandon the pursuit than to needlessly injure or kill innocent people.\"\n\nThe Michigan State Police have been involved in 44 deadly chases over the past decade, 120 motorcycle chases that resulted in a crash, and 212 chases on wet or icy roads that resulted in a crash, state records show.\n\nMost chases are short, said state police Chief of Staff Capt. Greg Zarotney, and in those cases \"road condition rarely has a bearing on the crash.\" As for motorcycle chases, Zarotney said, \"keep in mind that a pursuit only occurs when a decision is made by a driver to flee.\"\n\nAlthough police chases have been recognized as dangerous for nearly half a century, both training and technology remain inadequate, experts say.\n\nThe average police trainee received 72 hours of weapons training compared to 40 hours of driving training, only a portion of which covered chases, according to a 2006 Justice Department study of police training academies.\n\nA 2007 survey of Florida Highway Patrol sergeants showed that 80% thought that patrol officers \"did not have adequate training in the area of pursuit driving.\" Highway Patrol spokesman Lieut. Ryan Martina did not respond to repeated inquires about how the patrol responded to the poll.\n\n\"We're not taking it seriously enough because we think that one day of training that an officer may have gotten in their academy is going to take effect 10 years later when a pursuit begins,\" said Maj. Travis Yates, the Tulsa expert on police chases. \"Most officers will never fire their firearms ever, but we train one to four times a year\" on using guns.\n\nChases have been left behind in the modernization of police equipment that is now moving toward outfitting officers with body cameras. President Obama in December proposed $75 million in federal funds to buy 50,000 body cameras in the effort to \"build and sustain trust\" between police and communities.\n\nPolice use of Tasers, body armor, cameras and computers in patrol cars has soared, Justice Department reports show. In 2007, 90% of police worked for a department that used portable computers. In 1990, that figure was 30%.\n\nYet the principal \"technology\" for chases are tire spikes — two decades old and seldom used because police must know where a fleeing car is heading so they can pull a strip of spikes across a road. Police in Minnesota used spikes in only 3% of the nearly 1,000 chases in the state in 2014, state records show.\n\nA Justice Department overview notes that spikes \"can put both the officers and other motorists in danger.\" Houston police officer Richard Martin was killed May 18 when a fleeing driver swerved and hit him as he was laying spikes.\n\n\"There's been a lot of advances in police technology in the last 15 years. The pursuit-termination devices we envisioned haven't kept up with those advances,\" said Farrow, the California Highway Patrol commissioner.\n\nA federal effort to develop advanced systems has fallen well short of the hype of a 1996 Justice Department bulletin headline, \"High-Speed Pursuit: New Technologies Around the Corner.\" Federal justice and transportation officials began studying improvements to pursuit safety after a controversial 1968 study by Physicians for Automotive Safety said that 70% of police chases result in crashes.\n\nDevices that would shut off the engines of moving cars by transmitting microwaves are not commercially available a decade after the Justice Department funded their development. \"It's very frustrating that we haven't gotten to that next stage,\" said Bill Miera, owner of Fiore Industries of New Mexico, which tried to build the devices with the help of a $300,000 federal grant but ran short of money.\n\nA device that shoots a small, adhesive GPS tag onto a car exterior was introduced for police in 2010, but is used by only 20 of the nation's 18,000 police departments. Attaching a GPS tag lets police stop their chase — which prompts fleeing drivers to slow down — and follow the car by computer until it stops, where they can make an arrest.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety has embedded the systems in seven cars and uses them every time an officer can get within 30 feet of a fleeing vehicle, Capt. Chris Hemmen said. After tagging a car, police shadow it from a couple of blocks away. \"As soon as they stop, we're able to pounce,\" Hemmen said.\n\nHouston Police considered the devices after Martin's death but declined because officers still have to pursue a car and get close enough to fire the remote-controlled GPS tag from a launcher mounted behind the grill of a police car, department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said.\n\nThe $5,000 purchase cost also deters departments, which often spend capital funds and federal grants on routine items such as car tires and hiring more officers, said Trevor Fischbach, president of StarChase LLC, the manufacturer, which got a $380,000 federal grant.\n\n\"We're in the 21st Century,\" Fischbach said. \"We should be using 21st-century tools that are available.\"\n\nPolice departments that restrict chases have faced resistance from officers.\n\nIn 2012, the Florida Highway Patrol changed from a policy that allowed officers to chase anyone, to a policy that allowed pursuits only of suspected felons, drunk drivers and reckless drivers. The number of highway patrol pursuits fell almost in half: from 697 in 2010 - 2011, to 374 in 2013 - 2014.\n\nBut 35% of the pursuits in 2013 and 2014 violated the new chase restrictions, state reports show.\n\nDallas police used to ignore a policy that required them to stop chasing drivers who fled for traffic violations and appeared unlikely to stop, said Randall Blankenbaker, the assistant police chief. When the department in 2006 adopted an even stricter policy limiting chases to suspected violent felons, \"there were some folks who were resistant,\" said Blankenbaker, who wrote the policy.\n\nMilwaukee police still oppose Chief Flynn's 2010 policy restricting chases to suspected violent felons and people who present \"a clear and imminent threat to the safety of others.\"\n\n\"The crooks understand that this is our process,\" said Michael Crivello, the police union president. \"Criminals know their car is almost like their safe locker. They can keep drugs and guns in their safe locker.\"\n\nMotor-vehicle thefts in Milwaukee policy spiked to 18 a day in 2014, from 12 a day in 2013.\n\nFlynn said car theft \"became sport\" among juveniles. \"These kids were finding out, well, nothing happens to me. They had the prestige of being cool to their friends, the thrill of the danger and no consequences,\" Flynn said, adding that 70% of cars stolen in the city are recovered.\n\nOther cities have seen crime plunge since restricting chases. The Dallas crime rate has plummeted since 2006 — from 81 crimes per 1,000 residents to 48 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2013, according to FBI crime reports. City police have been involved in only one fatal chase since 2006, Blankenbaker said.\n\nPhoenix and Orlando also have seen their crime rates fall substantially since adopting policies that allow pursuits only for suspected violent felons, FBI reports show.\n\nMany departments base their chase policies on a three-page model the International Association of Chiefs of Police wrote in 1996. The model stops short of the Justice Department recommendation to list the offenses and conditions such as time of day in which a chase is allowed. The model instead lists factors to consider such as road and weather conditions, traffic levels, and the seriousness of a driver's offense.\n\nFlynn restricted chases after four bystanders were killed over three months in 2009 and 2010. Immediately after the deaths, Flynn defended his officers, noting they followed department policy and had actually stopped their pursuits only to have the fleeing drivers continue speeding away and hit the bystanders. Fleeing drivers typically continue speeding for a minute or two after police stop their chase, studies show.\n\n\"I thought to myself, it's not enough that we have a policy that tells our officers to terminate pursuits when they become unsafe. That was the industry standard,\" Flynn said. \"I needed an extra line to stop the pursuit in the first place, not because the officers were driving recklessly, but because we can't control the behavior for those who refuse to stop for police.\"\n\nContributing: Mark Hannan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/watchdog/shield/2018/01/22/nj-police-brutality-cases-secret-settlements/109479668/", "title": "NJ police brutality: Secret settlements keep bad cops on street ...", "text": "Killed. Beaten. Stalked. More than 200 citizens across the state have been victimized in recent years by out-of-control rogue cops. In many cases, the cops kept their jobs, even got promoted – while tens of millions of your tax dollars kept the abuses quiet. Until now.\n\nPiercing the shield\n\nNew Jersey governments across the state, from the smallest towns to some of the largest cities, have spent more than $42 million this decade to cover-up deaths, physical abuses and sexual misconduct at the hands of bad cops.\n\nThe abuse of police power has left a staggering toll: at least 19 dead; 131 injured; 7 sexual misconducts, plus dozens of other offenses ranging from false arrest to harassment, a two-year investigation by the Asbury Park Press found.\n\nMiguel Feliz struggled to extinguish his burning flesh after a car crash in Jersey City June 4, 2017. He needed help from the police. Instead he was kicked. Andrew Ford\n\nThe damage is concealed by government officials who use a veil of secret settlements and nondisclosure agreements to silence victims. Investigations of rogue cops are routinely hidden from the public by police, elected officials and even the courts.\n\nThe secretive payouts that keep abuses quiet are a vital part of a system that enables bad cops to do their worst. The secrecy starts at the police department and rises through the highest levels of government. Some of the state's largest cities and insurance carriers refused to release government documents that are at the core of the rogue cop problem.\n\nBut the tens of millions of dollars paid to settle hundreds of legal claims are not the worst part.\n\nMany of the bad cops remain on the street.\n\nThe Press investigation found that several towns knew of their bad cops' propensity towards violence yet ignored multiple warning signs until the cops crossed the line by injuring or killing innocent people.\n\nMeet Jersey City’s MD Khan, a violent cop.\n\nLawyer Daniel Welsh, left, with his client, former police officer MD Khan. Courtesy of NJ.com\n\nIn February 2016, Khan was arrested on charges of punching his brother-in-law in the face, causing “serious facial injuries and a possible fractured” eye socket and jaw, and threatening to shoot him, a police report stated.\n\nKhan brushed off the criminal charges as a grand jury dismissed the claims. His only punishment: a 40-day police department suspension. After that, the officer returned to the streets, armed with a weapon and the full force of the law.\n\nKhan’s suspension didn't prevent more violence. During a car chase that could have been a scene from an action movie, Khan shot at a suspect fleeing in a vehicle and then pursued the car through the streets of Jersey City, according to criminal charges filed against him.\n\nThe June 4, 2017, chase ended tragically for Miguel Feliz, 28, an innocent victim caught in the mayhem.\n\nMiguel Feliz Staff photo\n\nThe father of a 6-year-old was driving home from his Peapod grocery delivery job when the suspect ran Feliz's aging Toyota off the road. The car burst into flames after slamming into a utility pole.\n\nWith his clothing on fire and choking on the acrid smoke, Feliz needed help from the police.\n\nHe got Khan.\n\nKhan and another officer kicked Feliz as he laid burning on the ground. Feliz was struck in the face, a cellphone video shot by a passerby showed. Months later, both officers were indicted on aggravated assault charges. The officers have pleaded not guilty.\n\n“I thought they were there to help,” Feliz said weeks after the incident, healing from four broken ribs – inflicted by police, he says – and multiple burns.\n\n\"But obviously not.\"\n\nIn another state, Khan's first arrest would likely have been his last day as a police officer. In Florida, conduct involving an assault can cost a police officer’s license to enforce the law, even if they're not criminally prosecuted.\n\nBut not in New Jersey.\n\nFrom internal affairs to the courthouse, a weave of secret investigations, quiet payouts, nondisclosure agreements and court-enforced silence ends up keeping horrendous conduct and multi-million-dollar payouts away from public scrutiny.\n\nRogue cops are a fraction of the 33,000 officers who protect the public each day. But bad cops remain on the street because of one number: 466. That is the number of municipal police departments in the state, most with 23 or fewer officers, and some employing multiple family members.\n\nEach of the 466 departments has a unique political culture and an internal affairs system that is rarely overseen by outsiders – unless the police chief believes an officer might have committed a crime.\n\nNew Jersey is one of five states that doesn’t officially license police officers or have a method to ban bad cops, much the way the government can disbar wayward lawyers or pull the licenses of intoxicated truck drivers. The other states without a police licensing revocation law are Rhode Island, Massachusetts, California and Hawaii.\n\nOf at least 64,353 internal affairs complaints filed since 2011, less than one half of 1 percent – 226 – resulted in an officer being charged with a crime, the Press found. Of those defendants, 90 were convicted.\n\n\"There's just people out there that don't belong on the job. Fortunately, the numbers are few,\" said former Burlington Township police director Walter J. Corter, who also served as head of investigations for the Burlington County prosecutor's office.\n\nTo expose the problems with New Jersey's system for police accountability, the Press reviewed more than 30,000 pages of court, police and legal documents, settlements and once-secret separation agreements obtained by the Press, and interviewed dozens of victims, experts, lawyers and police officers.\n\nThe team found holes, conflicts and inconsistencies in police oversight that empowered problem cops in some departments to escalate their behavior until it became criminal, even deadly.\n\nConsider:\n\nA cop with domestic dispute history kills his ex-wife — Neptune Police Sgt. Philip Seidle has an internal affairs record that tops 600 pages and spans two decades, with several complaints known to involve domestic disputes between him and his wife. He was considered enough of a risk to the public that his service weapon was taken from him, but he was later rearmed. He used that gun to fatally shoot his ex-wife in 2015 in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter. He's serving a 30-year prison sentence.\n\nNeptune Police Sgt.

After nearly ripping the ear off a handcuffed suspect inside the police station in 2013, a lawsuit claims, Trinidad then looked directly into the surveillance camera to seemingly mock the ensuing internal affairs review by saying, “IA.” The suit settled for $364,000 without any admission of fault.

He was sentenced to five years in prison for lying on a police report in a separate incident. A lack of oversight — Now-retired Bordentown Township Police Chief Frank Nucera Jr. was charged by federal agents in November 2017 with assaulting a black man and repeatedly making violent and racist remarks. The need for outside intervention by the FBI underscores the limited oversight of New Jersey's hundreds of police chiefs. His lawyer didn't return a message seeking comment. Nucera retired in January 2017, after the alleged assault but before the indictment. He is awaiting trial. Upon leaving, Nucera was paid $54,002, including compensation for unused sick and vacation days.\n\nNow-retired Bordentown Township Police Chief Frank Nucera Jr. was charged by federal agents in November 2017 with assaulting a black man and repeatedly making violent and racist remarks.

Repeated beatings claims, department inaction — Alleged beatings by Atlantic City police officer Andrew Jaques prompted at least two lawsuits. The city refused to provide the Press with the settlement amounts. But the case raised the ire of a federal judge in one decision who called Jaques \"short-fused\" and \"volatile.\" He retired on disability in August, at an annual salary of $101,620, the Press found. Another city officer, Sterling Wheaten, has been the subject of at least 15 internal affairs complaints and the city paying $4.5 million to settle five lawsuits, according to media reports. No admission of wrongdoing was made in the settlements and Wheaten remains on the force at a salary of $108,548.\n\nAlleged beatings by Atlantic City police officer Andrew Jaques prompted at least two lawsuits.

No admission of wrongdoing was made in the settlements and Wheaten remains on the force at a salary of $108,548. The $1.8 million cop — Battling a problem cop can be extraordinarily expensive. Taxpayers spent at least $1.8 million in a 9-year effort to fire Manuel Avila, a Paterson patrolman with a history of mental health trouble accused of sexual assault but acquitted at trial. Although not convicted of being a violent cop, the city put Avila on paid suspension that ultimately cost at least $940,000. The city also agreed to a $710,000 settlement with the woman, plus at least $92,000 in legal fees. In a settlement with the officer, the city agreed to dismiss disciplinary charges against Avila if he decided to resign. The agreement allowed him to collect $85,134 for unused sick and vacation time. He is now trying to get a $72,000 annual pension, which would include credit for six years while he was suspended.\n\nIn the Atlantic City case involving the “short-fused” Jaques, the Press found in court documents that Jaques was investigated by his uncle. Jaques remained on the force for another 10 years, leading to more lawsuits from civilians.\n\nThe quality of internal affairs reviews meant to root out rogue cops “comes down to one person — whoever is doing the investigation,” said Rich Rivera, a former West New York police officer.\n\nFor the last 20 years, Rivera has reviewed internal affairs investigations, police use-of-force reports in lawsuits and consulted with police departments. “Because the entire process is secret, we typically don’t know what the contents of the investigation were, and whether they were properly done or not,” he said.\n\nWhile on the police force in the mid-1990s, Rivera worked undercover with the FBI to help put corrupt cops from his department in jail.\n\nRich Rivera, a former West New York police officer Staff photo by Kala Kachmar\n\nInternal affairs reports frequently show inadequate investigations and conclusions, Rivera said of the more than 900 IA files he has reviewed. Common problems included police investigators: failing to interview eyewitnesses; ruling a complaint “unfounded” if the investigator was unable to reach the victim; and failing to interview more than one officer, even if there were several at the scene.\n\n“We don’t see too many consequences for bad police officers,” Rivera said. “The consequences are (for) those in the community – people being harmed, people being falsely accused of crimes, people being sent to prison who might not have been sent to prison if IA was working properly.”\n\nClaims of abuses affected departments regardless of size, the Press’ investigation found. For example, the tiny borough of Absecon in Atlantic County, population 8,300, paid $2 million to settle a 2012 wrongful death case while Newark, population 280,000, settled a bodily injury case for $2 million.\n\nPatrick Colligan, president of the state Police Benevolent Association that represents nearly all 33,000 police officers in the state, said he doesn’t dispute there were problem officers in the past, but today, with many cops being watched with cameras mounted on patrol cars or worn by officers, there is a constant oversight.\n\nHowever, not all departments – until recently including Jersey City – use such monitoring devices.\n\nSub-standard police officers leave the force “close to every day in this state,” Colligan said. “Many you don't hear about, and it shows the departments are doing what they should be doing. … In 2017, there's nobody tolerating illicit or illegal activity.”\n\nThe financial toll\n\nInjury, suit, settlement, silence. Repeat.\n\nThe more than $42.7 million of taxpayer money government officials have spent to hush hundreds of allegations of police abuse are enough to fund the education of 2,800 New Jersey school children this year.\n\nIn scores of lawsuits, the pattern is the same. Towns routinely take the path of least resistance, at taxpayer expense, to minimize their liability when they face a claim one of their cops violated, hurt or killed someone. Millions of taxpayer dollars are spent, nobody admits wrongdoing and officers accused of misconduct often remain in place.\n\nOf the 531 officers named in suits alleging abuses, at least 231 remain on the job after their employer settled with their accusers, a Press review of employment records found. Many others normally retired years after an allegation.\n\nFrom a budgetary view, most towns usually feel no financial pain from a lawsuit. That reduces the incentive for changing bad police behavior. A $1 million court settlement against a small town, for example, can be funded by dozens of municipalities that pool resources to form a joint insurance fund. The payouts are not announced to the public and the final amounts are usually hidden in paperwork that the public never sees.\n\nOften these lawsuits are settled before a jury can resolve the critical question of facts – was excessive force used or were the officer's actions justified?\n\nAfter a citizen files a lawsuit, lawyers for both sides and the judge frequently agree that police documents reviewed in the case will be kept secret, preventing public scrutiny of an officer's history.\n\nIn the rare event a settlement comes to light, town leaders echo the same talking points: Legal fees were mounting, but little local tax money was spent to close the case. No admission of wrongdoing was made by the town or the individuals involved. Compared to the specter of costly litigation, it’s much cheaper to settle a lawsuit, they say.\n\n\"The system is geared to try to come up with some sort of compromise,” Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. “I don't think that you just look at it and say ‘wait a minute there was a settlement here that shows there was impropriety.’ A lot of times they may say, 'you know what, between all the costs and the liabilities, the exposure, this is better to move on instead of fully litigating.' The system is not drawn that everybody can get a trial.\"\n\nBecause every case is different, no set amount determines if a settlement was done to end legal fees or to prevent a multi-million-dollar jury judgment. Of the 243 cases the Press examined from 2010 through 2017, the average settlement payout was $178,000.\n\nSome of the higher six-figure settlements include:\n\nHomicide — Michael Anthony Burris' family called for medical help after he fell in 2010 in Millville. After refusing medical attention, he became combative and police handcuffed Burris and shackled him to a stretcher. Burris eventually suffocated. His death was ruled a homicide, but no criminal charges were filed. The town paid his family $875,000 in a settlement. The city denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichael Anthony Burris' family called for medical help after he fell in 2010 in Millville.

A beating claim — Philip Dubose settled for $500,000 after he claimed he was punched, kicked and pepper sprayed by Bridgeton officers in 2013. Dubose cannot talk about the case today. “We signed a confidentiality agreement with the police department,” said his lawyer, Alfonso Gambone. “We’re not at liberty to discuss anything else on that.” The city denied wrongdoing.\n\nPhilip Dubose settled for $500,000 after he claimed he was punched, kicked and pepper sprayed by Bridgeton officers in 2013.

Teens left in a freezing van — In 2011, five teenagers were locked in a Fort Lee police van for 15 hours in below freezing temperatures with no food, water, bathroom or warm clothing, according to two lawsuits filed by two of the teens’ parents. In two separate settlements, the teens each received $120,000 from the borough. At least 11 officers named in the lawsuits are still employed by Fort Lee, and their salaries range from $129,800 to $188,976. No admission of wrongdoing was made by Fort Lee.\n\nPolice officials often say the plaintiffs who file lawsuits against officers are seeking easy money, and that police are prevented from having their day in court.\n\n“It’s so costly to defend these cases,” said Seaside Park Police Chief Francis Larkin, whose resort town of 13 officers has paid $3 million to settle police abuse allegations since 2007 – an unusually high payout figure for such a small department, the Press found. “There’s always been a hop-off point because of the cost factor involved.”\n\n“It’s a shame that money became part of the whole formula because it would be nice to go forward all the way and show that there was no excessive force used on the part of the officer,” Larkin said. “That, I always thought that there was something wrong with that.”\n\nSeaside Park, though, did have its day in court in 2007. A federal civil court jury found two officers liable for falsifying documents and one of the two liable for using excessive force in the arrest of three tourists. The four were eventually paid $600,000 in the case.\n\nOne officer who was a defendant in the civil trial, use-of-force training director James C. Citta, remained on the force – and was later named in 11 more lawsuits involved in the town's payout of $3 million. The suits were settled without any admission of wrongdoing from the borough or Citta. Citta retired years later on a disability pension. Several efforts to reach Citta were unsuccessful.\n\nCalls to end secrecy\n\nEfforts for reforms are being made.\n\nAll police-involved deaths should be investigated by the state Attorney General’s office, not a local prosecutor’s office, Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, a Democrat from Essex County and the former speaker of the Assembly, wrote in one of her bills.\n\n“I think that the public is deserving of transparency,\" she told the Press.\n\nFamilies of victims must be assured that there isn't a coverup of \"the circumstances of the death,\" Oliver said. “I think there is great interest in doing social justice reform and criminal justice reform in this state.\"\n\nTinton Falls voters took matters into their own hands in 2017 by tossing out their mayor, a former police chief. A major issue in the campaign was once-secret police payouts.\n\nThe newly elected mayor of Tinton Falls rode the taxpayer outrage into office Nov. 7 after the Press exposed that $1.1 million was paid to settle two police whistleblower lawsuits.\n\nVito Perillo wins Tinton Falls mayoral election at age 93 Brian Johnston\n\nVito Perillo, 93, Tinton Falls’ new mayor and a World War II veteran, defeated the incumbent, who was the town’s police chief during the conduct alleged in the $1.1 million settlements. The former chief's son is a ranking officer on the police force. All government payouts should be publicly announced, Perillo said.\n\n“If it’s legal, they should do it, they should publicize it,\" he said in December about the settlements, after his election.\n\nHowever, invisibility remains the norm in many municipalities. The insurance carrier for many towns refused the Press' legal open records requests. And in court documents, many court records did not contain settlement amounts.\n\nOpen records advocate John Paff, chairman of the New Jersey Libertarian Party's Open Government Project, routinely blogs about settlements he's able to get from towns.\n\n\"What I'm hoping is it brings people to realize that maybe we need to fundamentally change the way we view things and concepts like employee privacy,\" Paff said. \"Because the taxpayer seems to be left completely out of the picture. They're just the people who are supposed to pay the bills and not ask any questions.\"\n\nOne law the Legislature and governor can pass is a requirement that all settlement agreements be publicized before they are signed by government officials.\n\n\"How are you supposed to have confidence in a system you can't see work?\" Paff said. \"It's just, 'trust us; we've got this under control. You have to trust we're investigating ourselves in secret, and you need to believe we're doing the best job for you.'\"\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen Staff photo by Andrew Ford\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, described opposition she faced from municipal officials when pursuing more open access to government.\n\n“I’ve found almost universally this apoplectic reaction if you mention the words ‘open public records’ or ‘Open Public Meetings Act,'\" she said.\n\n“Where it involves public funds, I do not believe there should be a non-disclosure agreement because this is not somebody's money from their wallet, this is from the taxpayers,\" she said.\n\nDeparting Attorney General Christopher Porrino AP file photo\n\nA judge is sometimes the final arbiter of openness. The Press has sued Neptune to force the township to release its 682-page, 20-year-long internal affairs file on Philip Seidle, the police sergeant who shot his ex-wife to death in the middle of an Asbury Park street in 2015. The township is fighting to keep the file secret, citing a state attorney general directive on confidentiality and the fear that all internal affairs records would be open to the public if the Press wins the case.\n\nDeparting Attorney General Christopher Porrino declined to comment after being presented with the Press' findings. He left office Jan. 16 when the new governor was sworn in. Gov. Phil Murphy's transition spokesman said the Press' investigation findings were shared with Murphy's attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal.\n\nFire and police\n\nFlaws in police oversight are personal for Miguel Feliz.\n\nWeeks after the encounter with Jersey City’s police, he winced as he peeled back white bandages to show the pink and red burns covering his arms.\n\nHis ordeal started on the evening of June 4 as he drove home after a day delivering groceries in Coney Island, New York.\n\nHe was listening to reggaeton. He noticed the police behind him.\n\nSuddenly Feliz's car was struck from behind by the vehicle Jersey City police were chasing. Feliz's 1999 Toyota slammed into a utility pole, power wires fell on the hood and the car caught fire.\n\nA bystander filmed on a cellphone as four officers, including MD Khan, approached, with their guns drawn.\n\n“Get down! Get down!” the officers shouted. Two kicks, clearly shown on the recording, immediately follow their commands.\n\nThe police union representative said that the officers were merely trying to stamp out the flames.\n\n\"No way. No way. There's no way. Impossible!,” Feliz told the Press. “I had to do all that myself.\"\n\nRaw video from a bystander shows police kicking Miguel Feliz after a car crash in Jersey City June 4, 2017. Andrew Ford\n\nFeliz intends to sue Jersey City for $25 million, according to a legal notice he filed with the municipality.\n\nFour Jersey City officers were indicted following the incident, including two charged with assaulting Feliz. They have pled not guilty and remain on the force, suspended without pay – except for MD Khan.\n\nJersey City records show that Khan's termination had nothing to do with Feliz.\n\nKhan, a four-year veteran, was fired over money cheated from the city and his disciplinary record.\n\nMore:Know your rights\n\nA vendor paid Khan $232 for off-duty police work. The city said that was a violation of its rules, which require all payments to go through the city. Khan's attorney declined to comment.\n\nIn the transaction, the city would have taken a $32 administrative fee.\n\nIs Khan an aberration among officers? Feliz thinks so.\n\n\"There's good officers out there,\" Feliz said. \"There really are. Just that some are not.\"\n\nThe Asbury Park Press wants to hear from you.

Tyre D. Nichols of Memphis died three days after the traffic stop.\n\n\"Earlier today, each officer charged was terminated from the Memphis Police Department,\" a written statement from Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn \"CJ\" Davis said. \"The egregious nature of this incident is not a reflection of the good work that our officers perform with integrity, every day.\"\n\nThe charges mentioned by Davis are internal, department charges, not criminal ones.\n\nOfficers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr., and Justin Smith were all fired Friday evening. They had been with the department since Aug. 2020, Aug. 2020, March 2018, March 2017, and March 2018, respectively.\n\nThe officers' release followed a nearly two-week long internal investigation into possible policy violations that occurred during the traffic stop.\n\nFederal officials:Civil rights investigation opened in death of Tennessee man who died after police traffic stop\n\nMore:Memphis will release footage of incident related to Tyre Nichols' death, officials say\n\n\"To see their faces makes me angry,\" said Keyana Dixon, Nichols' older sister. \"I'm trying to hold it together, but my heart has been ripped open. This is torture.\"\n\nJamal Dupree, one of Nichols' older brothers, and Angelina Paxton, one of Nichols' long-time friends, said they both feel let down by the officers involved.\n\n\"Knowing the history of police interactions with the Black community throughout time, these men took a position of power and instead of doing something to better the future and honor the past, they became no better than the days of Emmett Till,\" Dupree and Paxton said in a joint statement. \"They have let us all down. Justice will be served to them.\"\n\nNichols died Jan. 10, three days after he was pulled over in a traffic stop.\n\nVoices:Police kill far too many people during traffic stops. We must change why stops are made.\n\nThe traffic stop, Nichols' hospitalization\n\nAccording to a statement from the Memphis Police Department, officers pulled Nichols over around 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 7 and a \"confrontation\" ensued. Nichols eventually ran away, but was later arrested. Officers said another \"confrontation\" happened at that point, but he had already been detained.\n\nIt was after this that police say Nichols \"complained of a shortness of breath,\" and was taken to St. Francis Hospital in critical condition.\n\nAn image of Nichols shared with the public shortly after his death showed an intubated Nichols. His face was disfigured from a combination of significant welts. His nose was nearly bent into an “s” shape. Blood was seen on his intubation tube and on his hospital sheets.\n\nThis week:Tennessee driver's death after arrest sparks community protest, calls for state investigation\n\nFamily members of Nichols said he suffered a number of injuries, including kidney failure and brain swelling. He was hooked up to a dialysis machine prior to his death, Rodney Wells, Nichols' step father, said.\n\nInvestigations into Nichols' death\n\nThe officers involved were placed on leave and the internal investigation was opened by the city and police department. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was immediately called in to investigate the officers' \"use of force\" in the stop by the Shelby County District Attorney's Office.\n\nA federal investigation would be announced just over a week after Nichols' Jan. 10 death, with the United States Attorney's Office, FBI Memphis Field Office and Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division saying an investigation into possible civil rights violations by the officers was underway.\n\nThis week in politics:US hits debt ceiling; Biden has 'no regrets' for delay in telling public of documents\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The original announcement that the footage would be released publicly came just minutes before a memorial service for Nichols.\n\nFamily has also demanded that all officers involved be charged with \"murder one,\" Wells said at the memorial service.\n\nNichols was remembered by friends and family as someone who would \"light up the room\" when he walked in.

They also come hot on the heels of the local elections and amid controversy over the Partygate scandal and the cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, Labour leader Keir Starmer is also facing a police investigation over claims that he broke lockdown rules. Both votes will take place on Thursday 23 June.\n\nThe triggers\n\nThe Wakefield by-election was prompted by Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan’s resignation after his conviction for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. He said he was standing down to mount an appeal against his conviction and would “focus entirely on clearing my name”. He has since been sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Parish, who has represented the constituency since 2010, said it had been a “moment of madness”.\n\nNHS worker Simon Lightwood will be Labour’s candidate for the Wakefield by-election. The BBC said the seat is regarded as a “key target for Labour” who had held it for more than 80 years before the Conservatives won it in 2019.\n\nThe selection of Lightwood did not come without controversy. The executive committee of the Wakefield Labour Party walked out of the final selection meeting, said The Telegraph, claiming that Lightwood was “parachuted in” by Starmer’s office. Ed Balls had also been linked with the seat but later said he had “no intention” of standing.\n\nLord David Frost, the former Brexit minister, had been rumoured by The Spectator to be a contender for the Conservative candidacy. However, Nadeem Ahmed, a Conservative councillor for Wakefield South and leader of the Wakefield Conservative group from 2014 to 2021, was eventually chosen.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats selected Jamie Needle as their candidate. It will be his second bid to land the seat after he also stood in 2019.\n\nThe other candidates are:\n\nSir Archibald Stanton Earl 'Eaton (The Official Monster Raving Loony Party)\n\nAkef Akbar (independent)\n\nPaul Bickerdike (Christian Peoples Alliance)\n\nMick Dodgson (Freedom Alliance - Integrity, Society, Economy)\n\nJayda Fransen (independent)\n\nJordan Gaskell (UKIP)\n\nDavid Herdson (Yorkshire Party)\n\nThérèse Hirst (English Democrats)\n\nChristopher Jones (Northern Independence Party)\n\nAsh Routh (Green Party)\n\nAshlea Simon (Britain First)\n\nChris Walsh (Reform UK)\n\nIn Tiverton, Parish initially thought about running as an independent candidate, telling the Chopper’s Politics podcast: “It is an option for me and one I could consider.”\n\nHe has since given his “full backing to the Tory candidate Helen Hurford”, reported DevonLive. “She’s a retired headteacher, and businesswoman from Honiton, and I believe she will make a good parliamentarian and a good constituency MP,” he told the local news site.\n\nLocal businesswoman Liz Pole will represent Labour, while former Army major turned university worker Richard Foord is standing for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe other candidates are:\n\nJordan Donoghue-Morgan (Heritage Party)\n\nAndy Foan (Reform UK)\n\nFrankie Rufolo (The For Britain Movement)\n\nBen Walker (UKIP)\n\nGill Westcott (Green Party)\n\nPrevious results\n\nWakefield returned Labour MPs from 1932 until 2019, when it lost the seat to the Tories. During Labour’s long run holding the constituency, the second-placed party was always the Conservatives.\n\nSince its creation in 1997, Tiverton and Honiton has always returned a Conservative MP. The area served by the constituency has not been represented by a party other than the Conservatives since 1923.\n\nSignificance and predictions\n\nThe two by-elections, taking place at either end of the country, “provide a dry run for the next British general election”, said The Economist.\n\nIn Wakefield, the Conservatives must show they “can hang onto the traditionally Labour-voting areas which they won in 2019”, while in Tiverton and Honiton they must “stave off a resurgent Liberal Democrat party” that has begun to “take chunks” out of their rural base.\n\nA poll from Survation on behalf of campaigning platform 38 Degrees at the start of the month put Labour 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in Wakefield. However, internal polling seen by The Sunday Times last weekend put the lead at a “less than convincing” eight points.\n\nWhile the Tories won Wakefield with just a 3,358 majority in 2019, they secured Tiverton with 24,239 votes more than Labour. Internal polling from the Lib Dems, who came in third place, suggests the party is now “neck and neck with the Conservatives” in the Devon seat, said the i news site.\n\nMost of the bookmakers agree that the Lib Dems will win, while Labour will take Wakefield.\n\nVoters in the two by-election constituencies are in a “privileged position” as they have the “opportunity to speak for the country”, said The Observer on Sunday. “A double whammy of byelection defeats will frighten Conservative MPs in red wall seats and those traditionally true blue.”\n\nYes, by-elections offer voters “a chance to protest against the government”, said Will Dunn at The New Statesman. But he warned that by “making this by-election all about Johnson and his leadership” the opposition parties also risk playing into the prime minister’s hands.\n\n“A Tory victory in the present circumstances could be spun as a kind of personal vindication,” said Dunn.

The Liberal Democrat leader claimed that “lifelong Conservative voters” were switching their votes to the Liberal Democrats because they are “tired of being taken for granted by Boris Johnson”, reported The Independent.\n\nAnd the Conservative candidate Neil Shastri-Hurst tried to quell suggestions that recent headlines over sleaze allegations, Downing Street Christmas parties and tougher Covid measures were making an impact on doorsteps.\n\nThe Conservative hopeful, a barrister and former doctor, told The Times that locals were “predominantly” concerned with local issues such as ambulance response times and rural broadband speeds, but conceded that there was “a real mix” of reactions to Boris Johnson after a difficult two weeks for the prime minister.\n\nThe candidates\n\nNeil Shastri-Hurst, Conservatives\n\nThe candidate representing the Tory party is Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst. According to his profile on the website of law firm Kings Chambers, Shastri-Hurst is qualified in medicine and law, and “spent a number of years” as a medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps.\n\nBen Wood, Labour\n\nLabour put forward Ben Wood, from Oswestry in Shropshire, as its candidate. Wood began his “working life in a local hardware shop”, according to the BBC, and has promised to put forward “a new plan with fresh ideas” for the constituency.\n\nHelen Morgan, Liberal Democrats\n\nMorgan stood for the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 election and is a chartered accountant who lives in Harmer Hill, Shropshire.\n\nDuncan Kerr, Green Party\n\nA member of Shropshire Council, Kerr stood for the Green Party in both the 2015 and 2017 general elections.\n\nKirsty Walmsley, Reform UK\n\nThe first hopeful to officially declare their candidacy in the contest was Kirsty Walmsley, who is standing for Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party.\n\nWalmsley “became the UK’s youngest councillor when she was elected onto the now-defunct Oswestry Borough Council at the age of 21”, said the Shropshire Star. She has since “worked in Parliament as a caseworker for three MPs”. Walmsley has said that she would not have challenged Paterson, as he is a “man of integrity”.\n\nAndrea Allen, UKIP\n\nA UKIP parish councillor and chair of Whitchurch Town Twinning Association, Allen is a former modern languages teacher.\n\nRussell Dean, The Party Party\n\nRussell Dean – not to be confused with the Tory MP Dean Russell – currently lives in Monaco but has vowed to relocate back to the UK if elected.\n\nThe 55-year old yacht brokerage consultant is standing on a platform of “anti-sleaze and corruption” and has said that his party’s unusual name is intended to help achieve his goal of “attracting young people into politics and encouraging them to engage”, the Shropshire Star reported.\n\nMartin Daubney, The Reclaim Party\n\nMartin Daubney represented the West Midlands in the European Parliament between 2019 and 2020 while a member of the Brexit Party.\n\nVictory hopes\n\nLiberal Democrat internal polling, seen by Politico, suggests that the party is now “neck and neck” with the Conservatives, with one source “claiming the Tory vote has collapsed”, setting the scene for a “Shropshire earthquake” come polling day.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Labour have been “marshalling their forces to maximise damage to the ruling Conservatives” in what appears to be an unofficial informal pact between the two parties, said the Financial Times.\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat sources have begun whispering about the possibility of an upset, with one source telling Politico that “there is a real prospect” the Tories could lose the seat in a further blow to Boris Johnson’s credibility.\n\nThe party’s canvassers are “urging Labour supporters to vote Lib Dem tactically to defeat the Tory candidate”, the site added, with Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi getting in on the act when she told Times Radio: “Let’s face it, Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so.”\n\n“The conclusion that the Lib Dems are now favourites is shared by Tory MPs who have visited the seat”, Politico said, with one stating their belief that their party is set to lose.\n\nLib Dem candidate Morgan told The Times that her “sense is that turnout won’t be that great and that there are quite a lot of demotivated Conservatives”, adding: “Local people really do think they want somebody who is embedded in their community.\n\nNew contenders Reform UK, led by Richard Tice, formerly of the Brexit Party, split the vote in Old Bexley and Sidcup earlier this month, suggested The Telegraph,\n\nand Conservative MPs have told the paper that “the vibes coming back” from North Shropshire are “not good”.\n\nCould it be that the Conservatives are “facing a new Ukip, and an ensuing return to the electoral agonies of a split on the right?”, asked Mark Wallace on the i news site.\n\n“Tice is now confidently predicting that he will cause further trouble for Johnson in North Shropshire next week”, said Wallace, and it’s not hard to see why Conservatives might be watching the slow surge of support for the Reform Party with “furrowed brow”.\n\n“Not long ago, a surging Ukip regularly scored double figures in by-elections. Nigel Farage only gained one seat, but he secured enough of the vote to help Labour and Lib Dem candidates cling on in dozens of close contests.”\n\nThe Conservative campaign may also be further hampered by the defection of two North Shropshire councillors to different parties just days before the by-election, reported the BBC.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Market Drayton, Mark Whittle, said he defected to Reform UK because he could not back a Conservative candidate who was not local.\n\nConservative pick Neil Shastri-Hurst comes from Birmingham but has promised his home will be “here in North Shropshire” should he be elected.\n\nWhittle described his defection as “the most difficult decision I have ever made\" and said it had come after “a great deal of soul searching”.\n\n“I’m faced with no choice… how can I possibly back a candidate from Birmingham who has zero knowledge of North Shropshire and the challenges our community faces,” he said. “The Conservatives should have selected locally rather than be pressured into supporting someone with no prior interest or knowledge of the area.”\n\nFormer Tory councillor Anthony Allen has defected to Reclaim, founded by actor Laurence Fox last year, becoming the party’s first elected official.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/955131/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-12-december-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 12 December 2021 | The ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

PM ‘broke rules at Xmas quiz’\n\nBoris Johnson has been accused of breaking Covid laws by hosting a Christmas quiz in No10 last year. The Sunday Mirror pictured the PM reading out the questions. According to a source, many staff huddled by computers, conferring on questions and knocking back drinks from a local Tesco Metro. The insider said that in one office there were 24 people. London was then under regulations banning any social mixing between households. Downing Street said the PM “briefly took part virtually in a quiz”.\n\n2. Omicron ‘could kill 75,000 by April’\n\nThe Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 to 75,000 deaths by the end of April, according to a new study. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the UK will face a substantial wave of Omicron infections without further restrictions beyond Plan B. However, senior ministers are pledging to “resist” any attempt to usher in a “Plan C” of further Covid restrictions.\n\n3. Lib Dems ‘neck and neck’ for by election\n\nThe Liberal Democrats believe they are “neck and neck” with the Tories in the run-up to the North Shropshire by-election. The constituency will vote on Thursday for a new MP to replace Owen Paterson, who resigned his seat after the scandal over his second job. The Lib Dems say that internal canvassing shows support for the Tories collapsing in the aftermath of sleaze allegations. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey is making his fifth visit of the campaign this weekend.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Britain mulls sanction for Iran\n\nThe UK could impose new sanctions on Iran amid an impasse in talks over its nuclear programme. The Telegraph said Britain is understood to be considering a range of options, including severe economic restrictions on Tehran. Israel is threatening to draw up plans for an attack. However, the Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks with world powers in Vienna.\n\n7. Labour nine points ahead in poll\n\nLabour has opened a nine-point lead over the Tories in the wake of controversies over rule-breaking Christmas parties at Downing Street and Tory sleaze. A poll for The Observer put Labour on 41% and the Tories on 32%. It also showed 57% of voters think Boris Johnson should now resign, up nine points from a fortnight ago. Johnson’s personal ratings have fallen to -35%, down 14 points.\n\n8.

Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nOsorbo, who rapped in parts of the song, shared two Latin Grammys that “Patria y Vida” won in 2021.\n\nThe Cuban government so far has not commented on the trials, but previously said both men are agents of the United States, paid to disrupt the social order on the communist-run island.\n\nPer activists, Otero Alcantara faces charges of defamation of public institutions and national symbols, contempt and public disorder while Osorbo is being tried for disrespect and resisting authority.\n\nBoth men have said they are being unjustly persecuted for attempting to peacefully protest against government censorship.\n\nIn an audio message that activist Claudia Genlui distributed on social media purportedly of Otero Alcantara speaking from prison, the artist says Cuban officials have told him he will not face prison time if he chooses to go into exile.\n\n“In the country I dream of,” Otero Alcantara said in the audio message, “the children of Cuba will not have to emigrate and will be able to fulfill their goals on the island or return whenever they wish.”\n\nOsorbo was arrested in May 2021 following several confrontations with police and, according to activists, faces up to ten years in prison.\n\nOtero Alcantara was arrested in July 2021 during widespread protests across Cuba where thousands took to the streets decrying the lack of food, medicines and civil liberties.\n\nCuba blamed the US government for creating the unrest.\n\nAccording to activists, Otero Alcantara faces up to seven years in prison.\n\nOn Monday there was a heavy police presence outside the court where activists said the men were going on trial.\n\nPolice manning barricades blocked the street outside the court, preventing international journalists and diplomats from several European countries from reaching the building.\n\nTrying the men could create greater dissent among Cubans.\n\nAfter Otero Alcantara was detained following a hunger strike in 2020, hundreds of artists and students staged a sit-in at the Ministry of Culture.

One year on ...", "text": "San Jose de las Lajas, Cuba CNN —\n\nThe largest anti-government protests to take place in Cuba since the 1959 revolution started with a blackout on a boiling hot summer day. After days of power cuts by the government, residents in the small city of San Antonio de los Baños ran out of patience. On July 11, 2021, they took to the streets to complain.\n\nThe episode might have remained as a Cuban urban legend, a whispered about moment of rare public dissent on the communist-run island, if not for recent upgrades to the island’s mobile internet.\n\nBut that summer, Cubans across the nation were able to live stream and view in real time the unfolding protests in San Antonio de los Baños – and join in. Almost immediately across the island, thousands of other Cubans took to the streets, some complaining about the lack of food and medicines, others denouncing high-ranking officials and calling for greater civil liberties.\n\nThe unprecedented demonstrations even spread to small cities and towns where there are more horse and carriages on the potholed-streets than automobiles.\n\nMarta and Jorge Perdomo stand in front of a sign on their home in San Jose de las Lajas, Cuba, on June 28, 2022. Patrick Oppmann/CNN\n\nIn the city of San Jose de las Lajas, Marta Perdomo said her two sons Nadir and Jorge, both teachers, immediately joined protests as soon as news arrived of unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\n“My sons went out because like every Cuban they were desperate over the situation,” Marta Perdomo told CNN. “They are fathers. Every day here we have less. There was no medicine. It was a very sad moment with the pandemic. Children were dying and the elderly too.”\n\nAnger boiled over for Cubans as shortages of food and medicine – already a regular occurrence in Cuba – became increasingly dire. After years of government neglect, the creaky power grids were breaking down more and more often. While Cuban officials have long blamed US sanctions for the island’s woes, protestors on July 11 raged squarely against their own government for their worsening living conditions.\n\nVideo Marta’s son Nadir took that day shows crowds of anti-government protestors marching peacefully down the street, the demonstrators themselves seemingly in shock over what was happening.\n\n“This is authentic! It’s spontaneous!” Nadir says excitedly in the video.\n\nAccording to Perdomo, protestors in San Jose de las Lajas did not sack government-run stores selling items in hard currency or flip over police cars, unlike in other cities.\n\nAs more and more Cubans took to the streets, it became clear that the Cuban government was facing the largest internal challenge to its hold on power in decades.\n\nIn a speech on state-run TV, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel blamed the island’s economic problems on US government sanctions, said the protests were the result of a subversion campaign directed from abroad, and called the loyal to take back the streets from protestors.\n\n“We are convoking all the country’s revolutionaries, all the communists, to go into the streets, to all the places where they might replicate these provocations,” he said. “The order to combat has been given.”\n\nGovernment supporters carrying bats alongside police began to break up the protests. Hundreds of Cubans were arrested; some for clashing with officials, others for merely filming the turmoil with their phones.\n\nAs protests in San Jose de las Lajas were disrupted by government supporters and police, Nadir and Jorge Perdomo returned to their house and filmed a video on their phones that they were able to post online despite the government’s attempts to cut internet access on the island.\n\n“No one paid us,” Nadir says in the video, rebuffing government claims that the protests had been contrived.\n\n“We are just reacting the way all the people did.”\n\nBoth brothers were arrested days later and charged with alleged crimes including public disorder, assault and contempt. Their mother Marta said the charges against her sons were fabricated and that they were being punished for peacefully speaking out against the government.\n\nCuban officials say that many of the protestors arrested were delinquents and “counter revolutionaries.” But in their court records, prosecutors note that neither Nadir or Jorge had criminal records and both “were well regarded” in their community. In February, Nadir were found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison and Jorge to eight years.\n\nTo date, Cuban prosecutors say they have convicted and sentenced close to 500 people in relation to the protests, in the largest mass trials on the island in decades.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wife of arrested Cuban protester: All they asked for was liberty 03:12 - Source: CNN\n\nPreventing future protests\n\nBut international human rights organizations say the Cuban government is using the prosecutions to intimidate Cubans from daring to protest again.\n\n“We found that prosecutors were constantly charging Cubans for exercising their basic rights such as the right to protest peacefully, the right to insult their president or the right to insult police officers, exercising the right of freedom of expression,” said Juan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nOn Monday, HRW released a report on the protests that it says documents 155 cases of alleged abuse against people involved in last year’s demonstrations, “including harassment, arbitrary detention, abuse-ridden prosecutions, beatings, and other cases of ill-treatment that in some cases constitute torture.”\n\nThe organization also accused the Cuban government of further cracking down on civil liberties to prevent more protests from taking place.\n\nMarta Perdomo said she encountered the tightening restrictions first-hand after she was invited to Europe in June to speak about her sons to human rights groups and lawmakers. When she reached the airport in Havana, officials there told her and another mother of an imprisoned protestor they would not be permitted to travel.\n\n“They said I was ‘regulated’ and couldn’t go,” Perdomo said.\n\nCuban officials did not respond to a CNN request asking why Marta Perdomo was not allowed to leave the island.\n\nEven though Perdomo says she is worried about when her three young grandchildren will see their fathers again, she does not have regrets.\n\n“They didn’t have to go out but they felt the pain of Cuba,” Perdomo said. “That’s why they went out. That day my sons were free.”\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the July protests will be remembered as rare outburst of public rage or a new stage in the struggle for greater openness.\n\nAs the pandemic, US sanctions and the slow pace of reforms continue to batter the Cuban economy, officials on the island seem to realize that despite their heavy-handed crackdown last year, more protests could happen at any time.\n\nIn June this year, hundreds of Cuban students at a university in the city of Camagüey began a nighttime demonstration after power was cut in their dormitory.\n\n“F**k these blackouts! Put the electricity on!” they chanted as they banged on pots as seen on videos that the students uploaded to social media.\n\nCuban officials quickly turned back on the lights.", "authors": ["Patrick Oppmann"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/india/india-comedians-crackdown-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "In India, comedians can face arrest for making the wrong kind of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis time last year Nalin Yadav was detained in an Indian prison, not knowing when he would be let out.\n\n“I didn’t understand how or why this happened to me,” said the 26-year-old stand-up comedian, who spent almost two months behind bars. “I couldn’t sleep or eat. I had anxiety attacks. My mind wouldn’t stop racing.”\n\nHis alleged crime? Organizing and opening a show for a comic he says he had met just five minutes earlier – a Muslim comedian accused of telling jokes that insulted the Hindu faith.\n\nHe and four others have pleaded not guilty over allegedly hurting and outraging religious sentiment during a comedy show last January. They are still awaiting trial for the charges and face three years in prison if convicted.\n\nWhile comedy can be polarizing all over the world, in India telling jokes about Hinduism or being associated with someone who insults the majority faith can be enough to prompt legal action.\n\nExperts say India’s colonial-era laws are being used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to quash criticism and encourage self-censorship.\n\nAt the same time, authorities have been accused of turning a blind eye to vitriolic comments from right-wing extremist groups who align with the BJP’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.\n\nYadav is one of a growing list of journalists, activists, and entertainers who have become caught up in the country’s crackdown on freedom of expression.\n\nThe problem is, the comedian – who is Hindu – says he didn’t even mention Hinduism that night.\n\nNalin Yadav during a performance. Courtesy Nalin Yadav\n\nThe arrest\n\nJanuary 1, 2021, was meant to be a career highlight for Yadav.\n\nAs a relative newcomer to the scene, he was opening the show for the more experienced Muslim comedian Munawar Faruqui in Indore, a city in the BJP-ruled state of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nYadav said he told a few jokes about sex and Indian society, then settled back to watch Faruqui’s act.\n\nBut Eklavya Singh Gaur, the son of the BJP mayor of Indore, and a member of the right-wing group Hindu Protection Congregation, walked onto the stage and accused Faruqui of insulting Hindu gods.\n\nIn a widely circulated video of the incident, Faruqui can be heard telling Gaur that he also jokes about Muslims and his routine should be taken in jest.\n\nYadav attempted to mediate by calling the police.\n\n“I thought we’d be safe when the police came,” he told CNN. “I wanted to protect Munawar. I never expected what would happened next.”\n\nMunawar Faruqui during a performance. Munawar Faruqui via YouTube\n\nThat night, Gaur and three of his friends each filed complaints with police, accusing Faruqui of telling “filthy and indecent jokes” about Hindu gods and goddesses, according to court documents seen by CNN. The complaint also said that Faruqui told a joke about BJP Home Minister Amit Shah, but no further details were given.\n\nIt’s unclear when Faruqui allegedly told the jokes.\n\nIn his complaint, Gaur alleges Faruqui said it during his performance, while two of his friends said he told the jokes before his performance began.\n\nThese jokes “hurt and outraged” Gaur’s religious sentiment, the documents said.\n\nYadav and four others, including Faruqui, were arrested early the next morning on charges including “uttering words with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings” and “deliberate and malicious intention of outraging religious feelings,” as well as breaking some Covid-19 social distancing rules, court documents show. Breaking Covid rules carries a possible maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine.\n\nCNN contacted Faruqui’s representatives, but they declined to comment.\n\nDetails of Eklavya Gaud’s police complaint\n\nSource: High Court of Madhya Pradesh\n\nAfter multiple court hearings, Faruqui was released on bail by India’s top court on February 5 after spending 35 days in jail, with the court saying police hadn’t followed proper procedure when arresting him.\n\nBut Yadav remained in prison until February 26 when the Madhya Pradesh High Court finally granted his release on bail – after 57 days in prison.\n\nYadav said his 17-year-old brother paid his bail fees, $1,330, from the money he had saved for his university education – money that they had inherited after their mother died.\n\n“My brother couldn’t go to university,” said Yadav. “He sacrificed so much for me. How can I even look him in the eye?”\n\nLawyer Anshumaan Shrivastava, who represents Yadav and Faruqui, said the comedians didn’t break the law – and he pointed out that the Indian constitution guarantees freedom of expression.\n\nCNN contacted the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Law and Justice but did not receive a response.\n\nA free speech crackdown\n\nIt’s not just Yadav and Faruqui who have been on the receiving end of legal action.\n\nSeveral other comedians have angered the country’s ruling politicians. And while in other countries that might be the end of it, in India, some people have pursued the matter with police.\n\nIn November last year, Hindu comedian Vir Das’ powerful monologue addressing India’s rape crisis and the year-long farmers’ protests against agricultural laws polarized the country.\n\nVir Das attends 49th International Emmy Awards on November 22, 2021 in New York City. Arturo Holmes/Getty Images\n\nRight-wing activists called for his arrest, while supporters rallied to his defense.\n\nAshutosh Dubey, a legal adviser to the BJP, accused Das of “defaming” India and filed a complaint with the Mumbai police over Das’ “inflammatory” comments, according to a post he wrote on Twitter.\n\nDas has not been formally charged with any crime and continues to perform. He defended his monologue, writing on Twitter the video was “satire about the duality of two very separate India’s (sic).”\n\n“Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret,” he said. “I take pride in my country, and I carry that pride across the world.”\n\nIn December 2020, the Supreme Court held comedian Kunal Kamra in contempt of court for allegedly disparaging the judiciary and judges in his social media posts. In one Twitter post, he criticized the court’s handling of a case involving a right-wing commentator. If found guilty, Kamra faces up to six months in prison and a fine.\n\nKamra told CNN he has canceled about 100 shows over the past eight years because of threats by right-wing groups to the venue and audience – and it’s getting worse, he said. India is mostly a right-wing and “humorless society,” he said.\n\nKunal Kamra performs during a show in India.

But up-and-coming Muslim comedian Parvez Hassan says the country has become more intolerant since Modi’s BJP came to power in 2014.\n\n“It feels like we are going backwards in society,” he said. “There are now fears (among some comedians) of putting content on YouTube, of telling a certain joke in public.”\n\nAnd the issue goes well beyond comedians. Yadav and Faruqui were charged under a colonial-era law which criminalizes hurting “religious sentiment.” Experts say Modi’s government is using another piece of colonial-era legislation – the country’s sedition law – to silence activists, journalists and other critics.\n\nComedian Parvez Hassan during a show. Parvez Hassan\n\nIn 2015, the year after Modi took office, 30 people were charged with sedition, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). In 2020, the most recent data available, that number had increased to 73.\n\nIndira Jaising, an Indian human rights lawyer, said laws have been weaponized in India against anyone who disagrees with the government.\n\n“When a society cannot tolerate satire, it’s a society that has lost its constitutional values,” she said, adding the comedians’ case “goes well beyond freedom of speech” and calling it an “infringement” on their right to earn a living.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to inaugurate the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, in Varanasi on December 13, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn January, Rohinton Nariman, a former judge of India’s Supreme Court, also hit out at how sedition laws are being used. He said young people, students and stand-up comedians were being booked for criticizing the government, while others were getting away with calling for genocide against Muslims.\n\nHe was referring to comments made during a three-day event in the city of Haridwar in December when right-wing Hindus called on their followers to kill Muslims.\n\n“We find great reluctance from some of the authorities to book these people,” Nariman said.\n\nThe future\n\nSince his arrest last year, Yadav says his career – and life – has unraveled.\n\nBefore the arrest, Yadav was able to make ends meet by performing. But after he was released on bail, he said no one wanted to book him as they feared violence from right-wing groups. Right-wing vigilantes harassed him on the streets, and he could only find work as a laborer, earning a daily wage of $2.60, he said.\n\nYadav said he hoped that when he was freed from prison, people would see he had been treated unfairly.\n\n“But all my hope faded. I always saw the best in society … but I finally saw the real world.”\n\nFaruqui also took a brief hiatus from comedy after threats were made to his performance venues and audience.\n\n“Hate has won,” he said on Twitter in November. “The artist has lost.”\n\nHe has since returned to the stage.\n\n“Every law has been weaponized in India. They are being used against anyone who disagrees with the government.”Indira Jaising\n\nThe arrest of comedians is also affecting others in the industry.\n\nSome venues and organizers are canceling shows for fear of backlash and violence.\n\nThe LVC Comedy Club in the southern state of Goa canceled Faruqui’s performance in November after a right-wing group threatened to destroy the venue.\n\nA spokesperson for the club, who did not want to be named for security reasons, said the comedy scene in India was becoming “more hostile.”\n\n“We are not political and don’t endorse everything comedians say,” the spokesperson said. “We are free speech advocates and support the right to joke about anything.”\n\n“(But) in a country that reports 77 rapes per day, I’m baffled that jokes are where people choose to be offended.”\n\nIn November, Yadav decided to leave Indore to start his comedy career afresh in India’s capital Delhi.\n\n“It is ironic that comedy – the one thing that kept me alive and gave me hope – was the same thing that took everything from me,” Yadav said.\n\n“But I don’t blame comedy. I will never blame comedy. I blame the system, the government and the state of our society.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/china/hong-kong-speech-therapists-childrens-books-sedition-conviction-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Five Hong Kong speech therapists convicted of sedition over ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nFive speech therapists in Hong Kong were found guilty of a conspiracy to publish seditious children’s books on Wednesday, in a case that rights defenders say marks a major blow to free speech amid a tightening of civil liberties in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe charges center around a set of picture books telling the stories of a village of sheep resisting a pack of wolves invading their home – a storyline that the government prosecutors alleged was meant to provoke contempt of the local government and China’s central government in Beijing.\n\nIn one book, the wolves tried to takeover a village and eat the sheep, in another, 12 sheep are forced to leave their village after being targeted by the wolves, which the court believed alluded to the case where 12 Hong Kong activists attempted to flee the city to Taiwan as fugitives, but were intercepted by Chinese law enforcement.\n\nIn a ruling Wednesday, a Hong Kong District Court judge sided with the prosecution, expressing his view that the images had a correlation to events in city, and finding that the authors had the intention to “bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection” against the local and central government, or both.\n\n“By identifying (the People’s Republic of China) government as the wolves … the children will be led into belief that (the PRC government) is coming to Hong Kong with the wicked intention of taking away their home and ruining their happy life with no right to do so at all,” the judge Kwok Wai Kin wrote in a 67-page document outlining his thinking on the verdict.\n\n“The publishers of the books clearly refuse to recognize that (China) has resumed exercising sovereignty over (Hong Kong),” Kwok wrote in his decision, referring to the transfer of Hong Kong, a former British colony, to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nThe case has become a proxy for looming questions about the limits of freedom of expression in the city, coming amid a larger crackdown on civil liberties as part of Beijing’s response to wide-scale, months-long anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nThose protests, which were sparked in response to a proposed bill which could send Hong Kongers to be tried for crimes across the border, transformed in to a larger pro-democracy movement that was also linked to popular concern about Beijing’s growing influence in the semi-autonomous city.\n\nThe defense for the accused, who were all executive council members of the now defunct General Union of the Hong Kong Speech Therapists, had argued that the charges leveled against them were unconstitutional, given that they were inconsistent with their freedoms of expression protected under Hong Kong law.\n\nBut Kwok, who is also one of a small cohort of judges hand-picked by the city’s leader to hear cases related to national security, struck down that challenge, saying instead that limited restrictions on freedom of expression were necessary for the protection of national security and public order.\n\nIn a document outlining reasons for the guilty verdict, Kwok disputed that the books were merely fables promoting universal values, another argument raised by the defense, pointing to a foreword in one of the books that references an “anti-legislation movement” in 2019 and the “One Country, Two Systems” mechanism governing Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland.\n\nA sentencing is to follow on Saturday, according to public broadcaster RTHK, which could see the defendants – who have been denied bail since their arrests in July, 2021 – handed up to two years in prison. Lorie Lai, Melody Yeung, Sidney Ng, Samuel Chan and Marco Fong, ages 25 to 28, had all plead not guilty.\n\nThe case was thrown into the public eye following their arrest, when police accused the group in a Tweet of “sugarcoating protesters’ unlawful acts” and “glorifying fugitives fleeing,” with officials raising specific concerns given that the target audience was children. Beijing and local leaders have sought to encourage national pride among Hong Kong youth, including by bolstering national education in local curricula.\n\nThe verdict has been met with outcry from rights defenders. Human Rights Watch in a statement accused the Hong Kong government of using the “very broad” sedition law “to penalize minor speech offenses.”\n\n“Hong Kong people used to read about the absurd prosecution of people in mainland China for writing political allegories, but this is now happening in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in a statement. “Hong Kong authorities should reverse this dramatic decline in freedoms and quash the convictions of the five children’s book authors.”\n\nIn July, the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee also called on Hong Kong to repeal its colonial-era sedition law, saying it was concerned about its use to limit citizens’ “legitimate right to freedom of speech.”\n\nIn a reply, the government said use of the law was “not meant to silence expression of any opinion that is only genuine criticism against the government based on objective facts.”\n\nThe law, part of a 1938 Crimes Ordinance unused for decades, has been revived alongside Beijing’s introduction of a National Security Law to Hong Kong in 2020, which targets secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist activities – with a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nLast year a court ruled that parts of the original sedition law which referenced the monarch could be converted to mean references to the central government or the Hong Kong government. A conviction carries a maximum two-year sentence.\n\nOther recent cases have included the sentencing of a 75-year-old activist to nine months in jail for planning to protest against the Beijing Winter Olympics earlier this year.

But the nationwide blackouts were caused by the storm and were not planned.\n\nThe storm exacerbated an economic crisis that has been gripping Cuba, leading to shortages of food, fuel and medicine. Blackouts across the island were regular all summer, which led to rare scattered protests against the government. Those protests picked up after the hurricane made life harder for Cubans already struggling.\n\nOften at night, protestors in cities and towns have banged on pots and pans, angry at government power cuts. Some protestors have called for electrical service to be restored while others have demanded that Cuban leaders step down.\n\nThe recent protests have not reached the scale as those of July 2021, when thousands of Cubans took to the streets demanding change, in the largest anti-government demonstrations since the 1959 revolution.\n\nAfter days of power cuts by the government last year, residents in the small city of San Antonio de los Baños ran out of patience. On July 11, 2021, they took to the streets in a moment of rare public dissent on the island.\n\nCubans across the nation were able to live stream and view in real time the unfolding protests in San Antonio de los Baños – and join in.\n\nAlmost immediately thousands of other Cubans were demonstrating. Some complained the lack of food and medicines, others denounced high-ranking officials and called for greater civil liberties. The unprecedented protests spread to small cities and towns.\n\nWhile Cuban officials have long blamed US sanctions for the island’s woes, protestors during the summer of 2021 raged squarely against their own government for their worsening living conditions.\n\nIn a speech on state-run TV, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel blamed the island’s economic problems on US sanctions, said the protests were the result of a subversion campaign directed from abroad and called on Cubans loyal to the revolution to take back the streets. The state cracked down.\n\nCuban prosecutors said this summer that close to 500 people were convicted and sentenced in connection with the protests, in the largest mass trials on the island in decades.

They have pleaded not guilty to the charge of seditious conspiracy, a charge rarely brought by the Justice Department, and other charges.\n\nThe Justice Department’s opening statement featured messages and other communications among the defendants that prosecutors say show the Oath Keepers’ unlawful plotting to disrupt Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral win. As the prosecutors sought to use the words of the defendants against them, they also played video capturing the Oath Keepers’ actions in the Capitol and displayed maps and charts to help the jury follow along. Each juror has their own screen to see evidence.\n\n“They said out loud and in writing what they planned to do,” Jeffrey Nestler, an assistant US Attorney, told the jury. “When the opportunity finally presented itself … they sprang into action.”\n\nA lawyer for Rhodes, the first defense attorney to deliver an opening statement told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that the defendants “had no part in the bulk” of the violence that occurred on January 6.\n\n“You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did,” attorney Phillip Linder said, “but the evidence will show that they didn’t do anything illegal that day.”\n\nHere are takeaways from Monday’s trial so far:\n\nDOJ says defendants “concocted a plan for an armed rebellion”\n\nThe Justice Department began its opening statement with the accusation that the defendants sought to “stop by any means necessary” the lawful transfer of presidential power, “including taking up arms against the United States government.”\n\nNestler started with a reference to the “core democratic custom of the routine” transfer of power, which Nestler said stretched back to the time of George Washington.\n\n“These defendants tried to change that history. They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy,” Nestler said.\n\nThe defendants got their opportunity two weeks before the Inauguration, Nestler said.\n\n“If Congress could not meet it could not declare the winner of the election. and that was their goal – to stop by any means necessary the lawful transfer of power, including taking up arms against the United States government,” he said.\n\nHe said the defendants descended on DC to attack “not just the Capitol, not just our government, not just DC, but our country itself.”\n\nDuring the Justice Department’s opening, the jury was presented with video footage, maps and other audio-visual tools that prosecutors used to give an overview of their case.\n\nNestler’s presentation included iPhone footage from the attack that the prosecutor used to identify the defendants and other alleged co-conspirators. When video showing defendant Kelly Meggs was presented, Nestler noted the patch he wore, which said, according to Nestler: “I don’t believe in anything, I’m just here for the violence.”\n\nAs the video clips played, the jury also saw a map of the Capitol that Nestler used to situate the action that was recorded by video. Nestler also had a physical chart, perched on an easel in the courtroom, listing out the alleged co-conspirators.\n\nJurors were also presented with the messages that the defendants allegedly sent in the weeks after the election, including their calls for a violent response to former President Donald Trump’s loss.\n\n“Its easy to chat here. The real question is who’s willing to DIE” Meggs wrote in one message shown by prosecutors.\n\nThe DOJ also showed video and photographs of the Oath Keepers participating in tactical training sessions. A map of the Washington Mall – showing the site of the rally that preceded the Capitol attack and its distance from the Capitol – was presented while Nestler ticked through communications, including on the walkie talk app Zello, between the defendants that allegedly occurred that day.\n\nProsecutors preemptively punch holes in Oath Keepers’ defense\n\nNestler used the opening arguments to also preview how the Justice Department will respond to defenses the Oath Keepers’ attorneys are expected to put forward.\n\n“There is evidence that you will hear that they had more than one reason to be here in DC, in addition to attacking Congress,” the prosecutor said. The defendants may have been planning to attend the rally near the White House earlier in the day, Nestler noted, but so did thousands of others. Nestler also referenced to potential attempts by the defense to argue the Oath Keepers were preparing to come to DC to serve as security, noting that the defendants weren’t licensed, trained or paid for their security work.\n\n“Even being bad security guards isn’t itself illegal.” Nestler said. However, according to the prosecutor, the goal they were actually preparing for was “unlawful.”\n\nAdditionally, Nestler alluded to the belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act; the defense has signaled it plans to argue that the Oath Keepers were preparing to respond to such an invocation.\n\n“President Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act,” Nestler said. “These defendants needed to take matters into their own hands. They needed to activate the plan they had agreed on.”\n\nThe Justice Department also emphasized the backgrounds of some of the defendants and how that fit into the department’s theory of the case. Rhodes, as Nestler repeatedly noted, is a graduate of Yale Law school. He knew to be careful with his words and told his co-conspirators to be careful with theirs, Nestler said.\n\nThomas Caldwell, another defendant, served in the military, Nestler said. “Based on that water experience, he planned to use boats to get across the Potomac.”\n\nDOJ detail “desperate” focus on January 6\n\nThe Justice Department detailed the preparations the Oath Keepers allegedly undertook before January 6 as well as what they’re accusing the defendants of doing during the Capitol breach.\n\nIn December 2020, Rhodes told others that January 6 presented a “hard constitutional deadline,” according to prosecutors, and that they would need to “do it ourselves” if Trump didn’t stop the certification of the election.\n\n“With time, as their options dwindled and it became more and more likely that power would be transferred,” Nestler said Monday, “these defendants became more and more desperate and more and more focused on that date that Rhodes referred to as a constitutional deadline.”\n\nAccording to Nestler, the group organized a caravan of Florida members to drive up to Washington for January 6, and made preparations for where the organization could store firearms in Virginia, just outside DC. Some members of the group, according to prosecutors, brought weapons into DC that day, including chemical spray, thick pieces of wood, dressed in paramilitary gear.\n\nNestler’s opening described the “stack” formations the defendants allegedly used to enter the Capitol. He played a video of defendant Jessica Watkins, who allegedly led the first group, pushing against a crowd outside the House chamber shouting “push, push, push! Get in there, they can’t hold us.”\n\nThe second group positioned themselves outside of a suite of offices belonging to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Nestler said. Nestler said that Meggs had a “keen interest in Speaker Pelosi,” and later told associates that “we looked for her.”\n\nAt first, the defendants saw the breach as a success, Nestler said, describing them as “elated,” “boastful” and “proud.” But, according to DOJ’s account, the defendants quickly realized they were in legal jeopardy, and instructed one another to flee town, delete messages and keep quiet.\n\n“Let me put it in infantry speak: SHUT THE F**K UP,” Rhodes said in one Signal message, as presented by prosecutors.\n\nEven with their criminal exposure, Nestler said, Rhodes continued to plot. On January 10, Rhodes met with someone in Texas to try and get a message to former President Trump. The meeting, which had not previously been reported, was secretly recorded by an attendee.\n\n“My only regret is that they should have brought rifles… we could have fixed it right then and there.” Rhodes said of January 6, according to the Justice Department’s opening.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's what Oath Keeper leader's estranged wife is '100% positive' he will do at trial 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nOath Keepers attorney: Defendants “had no part in the bulk of” January 6 violence\n\nRhodes attorney Linder told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that defendants “had no part in the bulk” of the violence that occurred on January 6.\n\nHe suggested that there will be gaps in the evidence, such as video, that the Justice Department will show the jury. He said that, once the prosecutors put on their case, the defense will fill in those gaps.\n\n“You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did, but the evidence will show that they didn’t do anything illegal that day,” Linder said.\n\nAs the defense attorney delivered his opening, he was told by the judge to avoid topics that had been deemed out of bounds for the trial – with at one point, Judge Amit Mehta bringing him up to the bench for a private discussion.\n\nAmong the off-limits topics brought up by Linder that prompted the interventions were comments about the amount prison time the charges bring, the congressional narrative around January 6, remarks about defendants sitting in jail, and certain details about the Insurrection Act.\n\nMehta told Linder to keep his opening within the parameters of the relevant subject matter that has been established before the trial.\n\nLinder went on to preview other aspects of the Oath Keepers’ defense.\n\n“The real evidence is going to show you that our clients were there to do security for events for the 5th and the 6th,” Linder said, while calling his client a “extremely patriotic” and a “constitutional expert.”\n\n“Stewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day,” Linder said, as he described some of the rhetoric among the defendants “free speech and bravado.”\n\nThe attorney said that the evidence will show that there was no plan like the one that the Justice Department is alleging.\n\nLinder said that Rhodes is planning to testify in his own defense to explain what he believed would happen on January 6. At least one cooperating Oath Keeper, William Todd Wilson, is also scheduled to testify during the trial, Linder said Monday. Linder said that he intends to ask Wilson about his plea agreement, including an allegation that Wilson witnessed Rhodes attempt to contact Trump on the evening of January 6.\n\nLinder suggested that allegation, which was sworn in Wilson’s plea agreement, was untrue.\n\nSpecific DOJ accusations picked apart by defense attorneys\n\nDavid Fischer, the attorney for Caldwell, zeroed in on how the Justice Department is pointing to the so-called QRF – a military term for Quick Reaction Force – that Caldwell allegedly organized that day.\n\nHe stressed the word “reaction” in that term, and said that QRFs are organized to respond “to emergency situations,” describing a QRF as “a break the glass emergency team.”\n\nOf the hundreds of witnesses, including several Oath Keepers, that the Justice Department has interviewed in its investigation, “not one single solitary person they have interview[ed] has said that the QRF was meant to attack the United States Capitol,” Fischer said. He ticked off other events, including protests taking place in other states across the country, where the Oath Keepers organized QRFs.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge from DOJ addresses agreements to hinder the government’s ability to conduct its business, and Fischer previewed for the jury a defense that would argue that the Justice Department had not proven Caldwell organized the QRF with that goal in mind.\n\nFischer also launched an extensive critique of how the FBI handled its investigation into his client, calling what happened to Caldwell and his wife “an absolute outrage.” Fischer said that the Facebook messages the FBI used to justify Caldwell’s arrest were actually lines from the movie “The Princess Bride.”\n\n“There was some other powerful evidence … the agent had an issue with a Facebook message that said … ‘I’m such an instigator’ … he also said ‘storming the castle,’” Fischer said.\n\n“The evidence is going to show that those phrases in context were” lines from ‘The Princess Bride,’” he added.\n\nJonathan Crisp, an attorney for Watkins, made similar assertions about the QRF, and he told the jury that the Justice Department’s case against his client was missing context in other respects.\n\n“The Zello chats sound incredibly damming if you listen to them in a vacuum,” he said, while suggesting to the jury that his client did not hear a lot of what was said on the walkie talkie application through the noise of the riot. He also pointed to her attempts to engage the FBI in its investigation\n\n“These are not the actions of somebody who was trying to overthrow the government.”\n\nSenators were crying, FBI agent says\n\nThe first prosecution witness, FBI agent Michael Palian, testified that he witnessed senators crying as they hid from rioters who entered the Capitol on January 6.\n\nPalian is one of the lead case agents who investigated the Oath Keepers during the course of the almost two-year investigation.\n\nPalian told the jury that on January 6, he was sent to the Capitol in the late afternoon and assigned to guard a group of over 80 senators sheltering in the Capitol complex.\n\n“It was chaotic,” Palian said of the scene when he arrived. “I think shock would be the best word to describe what the senators were feeling. There was some crying.”\n\n“Did you actually witness senators, or members of Congress, crying?” prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy asked.\n\n“I did,” Palian said.\n\nPalian and approximately 70 other agents escorted senators back to the Senate chamber later that night where they resumed counting electoral college votes, he testified. Inside the Capitol, “it looked like a bomb had gone off,” Palian said, recounting “windows broken, doors broken, lots of debris in the hallways” to the jury.\n\n“If you took your mask off you started to inhale the pepper spray,” Palian said.\n\nJudge stresses that jury is unbiased\n\nEarly into Monday’s proceedings, before the jury was brought in, Mehta went to great lengths to emphasize that the jury had “no preconceived” prejudices towards the Oath Keepers and the defendants specifically.\n\nHe did so while explaining why he was denying a request from the defendants that the case be transferred to Virginia. Mehta ticked through statistics from the jury selection process that shed light on how the jurors had responded to questions meant to test their impartiality.\n\nNone of them reported having strong feelings against January 6 that would affect their ability to be fair. While about half of the jurors said they had heard of the Oath Keepers before, none of them reported having strong feelings about Oath Keepers that would threaten the jurors’ impartiality, nor had any of the jurors heard of the specific defendants, according to Mehta’s account of their answers on the jury questionnaire.\n\n“What that means is voir dire has done its job,” Mehta said, referring to the jury selection process.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Hannah Rabinowitz", "Tierney Sneed", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319/index.html", "title": "Mark Meadows' 2,319 text messages reveal Trump's inner circle ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nCNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former President Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden’s January 20, 2021 inauguration.\n\nThe vast trove of texts offers the most revealing picture to date of how Trump’s inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the election results and then reacted to the violence that effort unleashed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe logs, which Meadows selectively provided to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, show how the former chief of staff was at the nexus of sprawling conspiracy theories baselessly claiming the election had been stolen. They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden’s certification on January 6.\n\nThe never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump’s family – daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. – as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMeadows’ messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN.\n\nAmong Meadows’ most frequent interactions were those with Fox’s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/08/22/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-rally/575083001/", "title": "Live updates: Police release gas on protesters after Trump speech", "text": "The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nPresident Donald Trump returned to Phoenix for a rally Tuesday. Check back for updates.\n\n11:05 P.M.: Police chief says night wasn't 'chaos'\n\nThe mayor of Phoenix and the Phoenix police chief declared success on Tuesday night following a speech by Trump that ended with streets filled with tear gas.\n\n“The good news is the job of the Phoenix Police Department tonight was to make sure that everyone got home safely,” Mayor Greg Stanton said. “The good news is that is exactly what occurred in Phoenix tonight.”\n\nTwo people were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault on a police officer, said Police Chief Jeri Williams. Another person was arrested earlier in the day on an unrelated warrant, Williams said.\n\nReporters questioning the mayor and chief, some of whom were present as the scene unfolded, said they heard no verbal warnings and that there was little provocation. One described the scene as chaotic.\n\nThe chief denied that was the case.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it chaos,” Williams said. “Those are your words. I’m not going to use those words.”\n\nWilliams said that part of the use of force involved police showing themselves in full riot gear. Williams described that presence as an “act of showing we will show force if we have to.”\n\nWilliams said she heard from officers that the first gas came from protesters.\n\n“They had their own gas they threw at police, not our gas,” she said.\n\nSgt. Jonathan Howard, a department spokesman, told reporters that verbal commands to disperse were given. He said reporters who were with the protesters might not have heard all of them.\n\nHoward also said that officers first used directed pepper spray at individual protesters, before using the larger-scale pepper-gas balls.\n\nStanton said a small number of individuals marred what was a celebration of the First Amendment right of free expression, both inside the convention hall and outside.\n\nStanton said police worked with the groups that planned rallies and that he doubted any of the trouble came from those organizations.\n\n“We have no reason to believe that anyone who engaged in assault of a police officer were part of any organization that were encouraging people to come down here,” he said.\n\nBoth Stanton and Williams promised more answers after the department conducts an investigation of the events of the night.\n\n“Phoenix police is a wonderful organization,” Stanton said. “One thing they do well is they are willing to look in the mirror.”\n\n9:08 P.M.: Police fire more gas\n\nOfficers in riot gear started a slow march up Second Street toward Van Buren Street, clearing crowds following the Trump speech.\n\nEvery few feet, officers tossed gas at protesters. Television footage showed that at least one man was struck by a bean-bag style projectile.\n\n8:38 P.M.: Gas grenades in Phoenix\n\nPolice released pepper balls and pepper spray in the downtown Phoenix area after they said some protesters tossed rocks and bottles at officers, a department spokesman said.\n\nPolice also said that protesters dispersed gas in the area. A cloud of gas was seen on Second and Monroe streets. Reporters in the area heard two loud flash bangs on Third Street.\n\nAt least two Republic photographers were affected by tear gas.\n\nTrump's motorcade was back in Paradise Valley, according to a Republic reporter at the hotel.\n\n8:25 P.M.: Trump ends speech\n\nPresident Trump's speech has ended.\n\n\"Arizona will thrive and our beloved nation will succeed like never ever before,\" Trump said in closing.\n\n8:03 P.M.: Trump slams Arizona's senators\n\nTrump went after both of Arizona's senators in his speech Tuesday, but not by name.\n\nHe mentioned the health-care so-called \"skinny repeal\" vote that didn't pass the Senate. Sen. John McCain cast the deciding \"no\" vote, despite lobbing from Trump himself just before the vote.\n\n\"We were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming: repeal and replace,\" he said. He repeated five more times that repeal was just one vote away. The crowd started chanting, \"Drain the swamp.\"\n\nTrump said he was advised to keep up the tone of his Monday speech on the Afghanistan war\n\n\"They all said, 'Mr. President, your speech was so good last night. Please Mr. President, don’t mention any names,' \" Trump said.\n\n\"So I won’t. I won't. I won't, folks.\n\n\"One vote away. I will not mention any names. Very presidential.\"\n\nTrump then pivoted to Sen. Jeff Flake, again without naming him.\n\n\"Nobody wants me to talk about your other senator who is weak on borders, weak on crime,\" he said. \"So I wan’t talk about it.\n\n\"Nobody wants me to talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is. And now, see, I haven’t mentioned any names so now everybody's happy.\"\n\n7:43 P.M.: Trump hints at future Arpaio pardon\n\nTrump, during his speech, hinted at a forthcoming pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\n\"Do the people like Sheriff Joe?\" he asked the crowd.\n\n\"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? He should have had a jury.\n\n\"But you know what? I’ll make a prediction. I think he’s going to be just fine,\" Trump said.\n\nArpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for violating a court order.Trump had hinted in interviews that he was considering a pardon.\n\n\"But I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,\" he said, asking the crowd for its consent. The crowd cheered.\n\n\"But Sheriff Joe, feel good.\"\n\n7:27 P.M.: Trump blasts \"fake news\"\n\nTrump, in his speech, pointed out what he said was unfair treatment of his comments regarding the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump pulled a paper from his suit jacket that he said contained his statement from that Saturday, the day that a car drove into a crowd of marching protesters, killing one.\n\nBut, in reading it, Trump left out the \"many sides\" wording that caused so much furor from political figures.\n\nTrump also downplayed the size of the crowd outside the venue, saying the Secret Service said it was small.\n\n\"All week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside,\" he said. \"Where are they? Well, it's warm.\"\n\n7:08 P.M.: Trump begins speech\n\nTrump entered to the sounds of “God Bless the U.S.A.” by Lee Greenwood.\n\n7:02 P.M.: Carson fires up crowd\n\nU.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was met with thunderous applause as he took the stage to deliver remarks that centered on unity and inclusiveness. During the general election, he stumped in Arizona for Trump.\n\nDuring his brief remarks, Carson said there are forces “who want to divide us on the basis of race, age (and) religion.\"\n\nThe crowd booed.\n\nHe said the nation could not be divided and asked that hearts be filled with “love instead of hatred,” and tongues be used for “words of respect instead of slander.”\n\nHe was followed by prayers from Alveda King, a niece of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham.\n\nGraham then introduced Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n6:56 P.M.: Franks praises crowd size\n\nRep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said no one has crowds the size of Trump's.\n\n“I don’t go anywhere in the political world and see crowds like this,” Franks told The Arizona Republic from inside the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nFranks, a close ally of Trump’s in Congress, greeted the president at the airport when he arrived in Phoenix on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Franks was hopeful that the president would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, he didn’t think it would happen Tuesday.\n\n“I think that will happen. I don’t think that will happen obviously here today,” he said. “I think it will happen, because I think the president recognizes maybe better than most how it feels to be persecuted on strictly a political basis rather than a factual basis.”\n\n— Eliza Collins\n\n6:46 P.M.: Massive crowds ... in Cleveland\n\nAt least two photos were shared earlier Tuesday on Twitter purporting to depicting the large crowd size for the Trump rally in downtown Phoenix.\n\nThose photos were actually taken in downtown Cleveland during the parade for the Cavaliers who had win the 2016 NBA Finals. Both of the original tweets have been deleted.\n\n6:39 P.M.: Large crowds, no arrests\n\nThe gathering outside the Trump rally was large but relatively peaceful.\n\nAs of 6 p.m., no arrests had been made, according to Phoenix police.\n\nThe Phoenix Fire Department reported 26 heat-related calls, with two people transported to hospitals for further evaluation.\n\n— Megan Cassidy\n\n6:26 P.M.: Real fake news here to cover Trump\n\nJordan Klepper, a former correspondent for “The Daily Show,” was spotted interviewing several protesters and Trump supporters outside of the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nThe wry comedian's \"Daily Show\" spinoff, \"The Opposition,\" premieres Friday on Comedy Central. The new series will make fun of the hyperbolic and conspiracy-inducing \"fake news\" in the alternate-news media landscape, Comedy Central announced last month.\n\n— Garrett Mitchell\n\n6:20 P.M.: Trump headed downtown\n\nTrump has started moving towards downtown Phoenix.\n\nHis speech is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.\n\n5:57 P.M.: Rep. Gallego joins protesters\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, who earlier Tuesday called Trump an “abject liar” and “racist,” joined the protesters across from the convention hall.\n\n“This is a long-term exercise in democracy,” he said, urging peace.\n\nPolice had effectively separated the anti-Trump crowd from those who were entering the convention center for the speech.\n\nProtesters shouted that those entering the venue were taking a “walk of shame.” Some Trump supporters smiled and waved back.\n\nRetta Buntin of Gold Canyon said she came out to \"support the president.\"\n\n\"He's more concerned with people than with politics,\" Buntin said.\n\nBuntin and her high school friend, David Harris, held a yellow flag with the words “Don't tread on me.”\n\nHarris also said he supported the president.\n\n\"I don't remember any time in our lives when the president was so available to his base,\" Harris said.\n\n— Megan Janetsky, Megan Cassidy and Laura Gomez\n\n5:44 P.M.: Build that line\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m., the line to enter the convention center for Trump’s speech stretched down Second Street, headed east on Washington Street to Fourth Street, found its way to Jefferson Street in front of Chase Field and extended to Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nAlong Jefferson Street between the ballpark and the basketball arena, stood David Weller, 75, a Vietnam War veteran. He had doubts about whether he would get into the convention center.\n\n“I don’t think so, but we have to at least try,” he said. “I came here to see the president of the United States.”\n\n— Craig Harris\n\n5:20 P.M.: Waiting inside for the speech\n\nThousands of voters poured into the venue as Trump’s campaign playlist blared hits like Elton John's \"I’m Still Standing.”\n\nThe venue capacity is 19,000, a city spokeswoman said.\n\nCampaign volunteers handed out signs reading “Drain the Swamp,” “Veterans for Trump” and \"Buy American, Hire American.”\n\nKyle Beach said he drove from Los Angeles to hear “truth” from Trump. He wore a shirt bearing an image of Seth Rich and said he wants to know more about what happened to the man in the center of the conspiracy theory about the leaks of emails from the Democratic National Committee during last year’s presidential race.\n\n“President Trump is the only one who speaks the truth, he’s the only one who tells it like it is, and that’s the most important thing to me,” said Beach, 29, a designer. “I want to know what happened with Seth Rich ... and I want to know why the media framed Russia.”\n\nSusan McGraw of Sun City waited in line 2½ hours to see Trump because she wants to show her full-throated support of him in person.\n\n“I just like to listen to his voice, I love everything he says, he’s very positive, he’s 100 percent for our country, and he believes in our country, and he’s for our country,” the Republican voter said. “He is a great man. He’s like family, and we love him.”\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n5:03 P.M.: Let (cellular) freedom ring\n\nSocial-media posts claiming the Secret Service will shut down phone service around the Phoenix Convention Center for Trump's arrival were dismissed by the agency on Tuesday.\n\nThat includes both cellular service and social-media use.\n\n— Karisma Sandoval\n\n5 P.M.: Scenes from a Trump campaign stop\n\nSeveral groups of bikers made their way to the streets outside the venue. They had the stated aim of making sure attendees at the rally felt safe.\n\nThe invisible hand of the free market also made its presence shown. Concessionaires set up tables with both pro- and anti-Trump merchandise. “God Bless The USA,” blared from a boombox that was selling pro-Trump caps and shirts.\n\nOutside the convention center, Monroe Street was the dividing line. Those with tickets were allowed south; those without were kept north.\n\nAnd although Arpaio was not expected to attend the rally, protesters brought along a reasonable facsimile: a larger-than-life, inflatable Arpaio clad in jail stripes. The same inflatable had also been posted outside the federal courthouse during Arpaio’s contempt trial.\n\nNext to that inflatable was a Trump inflatable that showed the president clad in a white robe decorated with a Nazi swastika over his suit and tie. In one hand, the inflatable Trump held a white hood.\n\n4:42 P.M.: Marching toward Trump\n\nHundreds of people met at Civic Space Park near Arizona State University before walking to protest in front of the venue where Trump will speak.\n\nSome wore Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter T-shirts. Another group, self-identified as the \"John Browne Group,\" carried AR-15 rifles.\n\nPuente Arizona, One Arizona, Mi Familia Vota, and Progressive Democrats of America handed out water and granola bars from three big coolers before the group marched south on Central Avenue toward the Convention Center.\n\nThey began their chants: \"No Trump; No KKK; No Fascist USA\" and \"This is what democracy looks like.\" The march ended in front of the Herberger Theater, across the street from the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\n— Laura Gomez\n\n4:22 P.M.: Trump arrives at Montelucia\n\nTrump's motorcade traveled up State Route 51 to the Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia.\n\nThere had been a steady police presence outside the hotel through the afternoon.\n\nTwo officers at the entrance directed vehicles away from the hotel.\n\nA SWAT vehicle and several undercover police vehicles began entering the resort at around 3:30 p.m. Their presence increased over the hour until the motorcade arrived.\n\n— BrieAnnaFrank\n\n4:12 P.M.: The protest scene\n\nAt least a dozen organized groups were planning protests against Trump outside the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, a number of individual protesters had gathered across the street from the convention center on Second Street just south of Monroe. The atmosphere between protesters and supporters standing in line waiting to get into the convention center was tense at times. Some shouts were exchanged.\n\n\"Build that wall,\" chanted supporters.\n\n\"Tear the wall down,\" chanted protesters.\n\nCathy Harvard of Phoenix held a handmade \"Impeach\" sign. The 58-year-old receptionist said this was the first Trump event that she protested, and she felt strongly she needed to show up outside the convention center to speak her mind. She said she left work at 1 p.m. to get to a spot outside the convention center.\n\n\"I do not like that man. He does not belong in the White House,\" she said. “He needs to be impeached. He needs to go.\"\n\nStanding in the shade across from the convention center, she wiped her brow with a washcloth.\n\n\"He shouldn't even be in Arizona,\" she said. \"He's out having a campaign rally. Like someone is going to vote for him in 2020?\"\n\n— Anne Ryman\n\n3:47 P.M.: Trump lands in Phoenix\n\nTrump has landed in Phoenix.\n\nAir Force One left Yuma around 3:13 p.m. and landed about 30 minutes later at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, approaching from the east.\n\nA crowd of about 60 supporters were on hand to greet him. A cheer erupted when Trump emerged from Air Force One and waved at them.\n\nOn the tarmac, Trump was greeted by Rep. Trent Franks and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nTelevision cameras showed Ducey getting into the limo with Trump and Vice President Pence and driving away. Ducey was seated facing backwards and appeared to be having an animated conversation with Trump.\n\n3:31 P.M.: Not the same old supporting acts for Trump\n\nDon't expect all of the usual suspects to be on stage Tuesday with Trump, according to organizers. One notable absence will be Arpaio.\n\nAmong those expected to attend: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nThe agenda, which was not finalized as of early Tuesday afternoon, was expected to include a prayer for unity in the wake of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe VIP list also includes state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, one of Trump’s earliest supporters for president, and his wife, Marina; former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, an ardent Trump supporter and one of his defenders in chief; Phil Lovas, a former state lawmaker who now works for the Trump administration; and Lori Klein, the Arizona Republican National Committeewoman and former state lawmaker.\n\nKlein, in 2011, pointed a loaded handgun at a reporter's chest during an interview. Months earlier, she was stopped as she tried to carry that same handgun into the state Capitol during the State of the State address. It was two days after the shooting at a grocery store outside Tucson that killed six and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was the target of a failed assassination attempt.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n3:14 P.M.: Goldwater Park closed; Paradise Valley prepares\n\nIt is not known what Sen. Barry Goldwater would think of President Trump if he were alive today. There is no way today to gaze upon his statute and contemplate it.\n\nThe Barry Goldwater Memorial, a small Paradise Valley park dedicated to Arizona’s most famous senator, is closed Tuesday due to Trump’s planned overnight stay at a resort across the street.\n\nThe entrance to the free attraction, which opened in 2004 on the northeast corner of Tatum Boulevard and Lincoln Drive, is blocked and there is a sign that says, “Park Closed.’’\n\nThe memorial is across the street from the Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia, where Trump is expected to stay on Tuesday night after his rally in downtown Phoenix. The sidewalks in front of the resort on Lincoln Drive are closed beginning at Tatum Boulevard.\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson\n\n3:02 P.M.: Next stop, Phoenix\n\nYUMA – President Donald Trump has boarded Air Force One.\n\nHe spent time taking selfies with Marines and signing autographs.\n\n2:52 P.M.: Drawn-out denial for Steve Benson\n\nSteve Benson is a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist and a respected presence at The Arizona Republic. But that, and an email, still could not get him a credential into the Trump campaign stop.\n\nBenson was told in an email Sunday from the campaign press office that his credential request had been denied.\n\n“Any name that does not appear on our list, will not be permitted to enter as credentialed media,” the email said. The misplaced comma was in the email.\n\nBenson has good company.\n\nAlso denied credentials were KPHO-TV’s Morgan Loew and Gilbert Zermeno. The reporter and cameraman have long teamed up to do investigations for Phoenix’s CBS affiliate.\n\nZermeno, on Facebook, posted: “Guess I’ll be looking for a scalper.”\n\n2:42 P.M.: Sky Harbor prepares\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was already showing signs of preparation for the president's arrival.\n\nThe plane ramp at the executive terminal, the small building that sits near the west end of the airport, usually faces out to Sky Harbor Boulevard over a strip of landscaping and grassy span.\n\nLarge shuttle buses of the type that normally ferry passengers to the airport’s rental-car center were lined up, one after another, just inside the metal fence around the terminal. Black fabric on the fence further obscured the view. Police cruisers lined up at the entrance to the terminal’s small parking area.\n\nAir Force One is expected to arrive at the terminal Tuesday afternoon following the president's stop in Yuma.\n\n2:16 P.M.: No pardon for Arpaio\n\nTrump will not pardon Arpaio during his visit Tueday, according to a White House spokesperson.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said in a tweet that the lack of a pardon showed the power of activist groups like Puente Arizona, One Arizona, Lucha, Promise Arizona, Mi Familia Vota and others.\n\n1:57 P.M.: Trump arrives in Arizona\n\nYUMA – Trump has arrived in Arizona. He landed at 1:43 p.m.\n\nHe remained inside Air Force One for close to 10 minutes before emerging with a smile and waving to the small crowd that welcomed him to the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma.\n\nHis chief of staff John Kelly followed the president down the stairs. They then got into the vehicle escort that would take them to a series of appointments.\n\nFirst up, Trump met with officials from Customs and Border Protection at their hangar near the airport, and saw some of the equipment they use to patrol the Yuma border area.\n\nHe them went into a closed-door briefing regarding border enforcement measures.\n\nDuring this time, Marines stationed on base lined up in 106-degree weather at the tarmac, waiting for the chance to greet the commander in chief, before he set out to Phoenix.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n1:26 P.M.: Will Trump pardon Arpaio?\n\nSpeculation is mounting whether Trump will pardon Joe Arpaio and many are taking to social media to express both support and opposition to a pardon.\n\n\"Obama pardoned traitor Chelsea Manning, Trump will pardon a patriot in Joe Arpaio,\" wrote one Twitter follower.\n\nAnd then there is this tweet from a follower who opposes a pardon.\n\n\"Trump: How can I distract people today. Maybe I will find the most racist criminal I can find & pardon him. Enter, Joe Arpaio,\" @funder\n\nHalf of Arizonans believe Trump should not pardon Arpaio, according to a poll conducted over the weekend.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n10:30 A.M.: Group opposes Arpaio pardon\n\nThe non-profit Mi Familia Vota hosted a news conference outside St. Mary's Basilica to denounce Trump's visit to Phoenix and his potential to pardon Arpaio.Speakers represented various organizations, including Center for Biological Diversity, CHISPA, Planned Parenthood of Arizona, and the Arizona Coalition for Change.\n\n\"We will continue to organize our community — educate them — and ensure that folks that align with out values are elected into office to represent our community,\" Mi Familia Vota spokesman Eduardo Sainz said.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D.-Ariz) and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero spoke.\n\n\"We refuse to stand idly by while Trump destroys everything America stands for,\" Romero said.\n\nMany of the protesters in attendance had signs and t-shirts announcing the community will not be divided and they will stand strong. The biggest sign was designed by the Center For Biological Diversity, which, translated from Spanish, said, \"Migration is natural. We reject the wall.\"\n\n— Gabriella Del Rio\n\n10:15 A.M.: Schools, businesses closing\n\nTrump's rally has prompted many businesses, offices and stores in the downtown area to close early for the day, although some will remain open. Some schools in the area also are sending students home early.\n\nThis is a sign posted on the Starbucks at the Arizona Center.\n\nThis is the first time in recent memory that a political rally has triggered a widespread closure of businesses, stores and offices, report Kaila White and Garrett Mitchell.\n\nSome are closing to avoid traffic congestion, others out of safety concerns since this is the first Trump rally in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n9:30 A.M.: Need a new hat?\n\nMerchandise tables have begun to pop up right next to the growing line for the rally.\n\n\"Make America Great Again\" hats and shirts are being snatched up by the handful by supporters who dared to step out of their place in line to purchase one.\n\nShirts with President Trump's face and phrases such as \"Built Trump Tough\" and \"It's gonna be YUGE\" line the tables.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n9:15 A.M.: Check out the kicks\n\nAmong the growing crowd of supporters, there are a few with unique Trump-inspired outifts.\n\nThe favorite so far is a pair of high-top sneakers with Trump written down the side and a \"Make America Great Again\" insignia on them.\n\nJohn Rynhard of Phoenix sported the shoes. He said he bought them for $69.99 online about six months ago.\n\n“I was on Facebook and an ad popped up for Trump shoes,” Rynhard said. “So naturally, I clicked on it and that’s where I found them at.”\n\nRynhard said he had been waiting to go his first Trump rally to wear them so today is the first time they'd hit the pavement.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n9:12 A.M.: Trump to tour Yuma first\n\nPresident Trump will get a first-hand look at both the effectiveness and challenges of building a wall along the border when he visits the Yuma area in southwestern Arizona Tuesday, hours before his rally in Phoenix.\n\nIt will be the first time Trump has visited the border since he became president, reports The Arizona Republic border reporter Rafael Carranza, who will be covering his visit to Yuma.\n\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to build a \"great, great\" wall along the southern border, and his visit to Yuma is expected to demonstrate to his supporters that he isn't backing off that promise.\n\nIllegal immigration and drug smuggling were once out of control along this part of the border until Congress approved 62 miles of fencing. The Border Patrol's Yuma Sector is now one of the quietest along the southern border, where overall apprehensions of undocumented immigrants have fallen to some of the lowest levels in decades.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n8 A.M.: Trump supporters up for hours\n\nThe first dozen Trump supporters are already gathered at the convention center in anticipation of Trump's arrival later in the afternoon.\n\nThe first arrived at noon Monday. The next handful were there by 4 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nGene Huber, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was first in line after coming in at noon Monday.\n\n\"I just love to see him,\" Huber said of Trump. \"The excitement that he brings to our family and 'We The People' our movement.\"\n\nHuber was later joined by Alexis Marcelino and Tracey Opbroek, of Apple Valley, California.\n\nMarcelino said she hopes Trump spends at least a portion of his speech clarifying that his supporters do not reflect the views of hate groups like Nazis and white supremacists. She said she doesn't want to see people with swastikas supporting Trump in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\"We all agree that that is hateful and I kind of hope from there that we can move on,\" she said.\n\nOne of the most vocal supporters in the crowd is Irma Trujillo, of El Paso, Texas, who arrived with a bright neon pink sign that read \"Deplorable Latina Loves Trump.\"\n\nShe got a big round of applause from the rest of the group.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the pardoning of Joe Arpaio,\" Trujillo said. \"I have to see it. I am so excited for that, if it happens.\"\n\nThe doors for the rally open at 4 p.m.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n7 A.M.: Look for the chicken\n\nThe 20-foot inflatable Donny the Tax March Chicken is apparently working his way to Phoenix.\n\nThe giant chicken, made in the likeness of President Donald Trump, has been popping up in Washington, D.C., on and off for several months. According to its handlers, the chicken symbolizes the need for transparency in the Trump Administration and a continued push for Trump to release his tax returns.\n\nThe organization Indivisible Surprise is hosting Donny's Phoenix visit.\n\n— Alia Beard Rau\n\n6 A.M.: Potential for drama\n\nAmong the few points President Donald Trump's supporters and critics would likely agree on is that the former reality-TV star's administration hasn't lacked drama. And his visit Tuesday to Phoenix, his first as president, certainly has the potential for drama.\n\nSEE ALSO:What to expect for Trump rally in Phoenix\n\nAmong the looming questions is whether Trump will pardon Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a court order to halt his signature immigration patrols. Trump has said he was seriously considering a pardon for the 85-year-old lawman, who was among his first high-profile supporters.\n\nAnother question is whether Trump will go after Sen. Jeff Flake, the state's junior Republican senator who's running for re-election and has been one of the president's loudest GOP critics. Flake recently published a book in which he criticizes the direction of his party under Trump, as well as the president's pugilistic tone. Will Trump endorse a Flake challenger?\n\nSome will also be watching Trump's tone in the wake of Monday night's policy speech on his strategy for the war in Afghanistan. Some were struck as much by his measured tone as his acknowledgment that he is changing course from his call during the campaign to withdraw from Afghanistan. Is this a lasting shift in tone or another quiet moment interrupting the bombast the American public has become accustomed to?\n\nFinally, there's one place authorities hope to see no drama: the streets of downtown Phoenix.\n\nThis is Trump's first major public address since his tepid response to the death of a Charlottesville, Virginia, woman amid demonstrations by white supremacists was seen by many as a low mark for this White House.\n\nImmigration activists are hoping to have thousands on hand to protest Trump's policies and, should it happen, an Arpaio pardon. Given there will be thousands of Trump's supporters on hand for the rally, it could be a volatile mix.\n\n— Michael Squires\n\nMONTINI:Will Trump trash McCain, Flake then pardon Arpaio? | ROBERTS:Trump headed to AZ to endorse Jeff DeWit? | EDITORIAL:Trump let North Korea control his next move\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nEx-Gov.

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLast week, Bannon’s legal team subpoenaed 16 lawmakers and congressional staffers to testify at the July trial and produce documents, according to one of Bannon’s attorneys and copies of the subpoenas provided to CNN. The subpoenas were aimed at all nine members of the select committee, three committee staffers and General Counsel for the House of Representatives Douglas Letter. Bannon also subpoenaed House Democratic leadership, including Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Rep. Jim Clyburn.\n\nA spokesman for the House committee declined to comment. Spokespeople for Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn did not immediately respond to requests to comment.\n\nHistorically it has been a challenge to compel members of Congress to testify because their legislative activity is protected under the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause.\n\n“In this particular case I’m extremely confident that the staff members and members of the House would be shielded by the Speech and Debate Clause,” said Thomas Spulak, who served as general counsel to the House of Representatives in the 1990s.\n\nThe lawmakers and staffers could file a motion to quash the subpoenas on those grounds.\n\n“I’m very confident that defense would be upheld, and they will not be compelled to produce anything or appear for anything,” Spulak said.\n\nBannon’s attorneys are seeking to challenge the makeup of the House select committee, question lawmakers’ motives for targeting Bannon and argue Bannon was not required to testify because doing so could have jeopardized former President Trump’s executive privilege.\n\n“I believed from the start that it’s a purely political motive going after Bannon,” said David Schoen, one of Bannon’s attorneys. He said if the committee truly wanted Bannon’s testimony, it would not have referred him for criminal contempt charges.\n\n“They’ll never get his testimony now,” Schoen said. “I have to draw the conclusion it’s purely a political message. They’re afraid of the message Bannon puts out there.”\n\nOther Republicans have also challenged the legitimacy of the committee and refused to testify. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to comply with a committee subpoena, claiming it was not legally valid. Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro, who has been charged with two counts of contempt of Congress, also refused to testify and has cited executive privilege issues and claimed his subpoena from the “kangaroo committee” was unenforceable.\n\nThe subpoenas also call for targets to hand over a roster of documents, including items relevant to the establishment of the committee, the decision to refer Bannon for criminal contempt and communications with one of Bannon’s lawyers. In the case of Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, Bannon’s team has also requested documents that pertain to their recently published books.", "authors": ["Sara Murray"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/09/11/sheriff-joe-arpaio-legacy/71888720/", "title": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio has always done it his way", "text": "Michael Kiefer\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nJoe Arpaio’s office is as big as his ego.\n\nIt sits atop the headquarters that the Maricopa County supervisors built for him on Jackson Street in 2013, part fortress and part temple to America’s Toughest Sheriff. And though Arpaio is not a large man, he fills the room, from the oversized desk at one end to the oversized conference table at the other.\n\nHe speaks of himself in the third person; he pounds his fists on the table as he speaks.\n\n“This sheriff has been elected six times,” he said in an interview. “He must be doing something right. So the people must like this sheriff.”\n\nThe word comes off his tongue sounding like “SHIR-uff.”\n\nArpaio has been the sheriff of Maricopa County for more than 22 years, the longest-serving sheriff in county history.\n\n“Why am I doing this?” he continued. “I ask myself this question. I’m going to give you the old political thing: People want me to do this.”\n\nIt’s true: Arpaio is incredibly likable.\n\nAnd he is a conundrum, an unlikely idol, unsophisticated, gruff, decidedly blue collar. His face appears frozen in a half sneer. He is of average height, maybe an inch shorter. He is not a fashion icon, from the over-long sleeves of his sports jackets to the old-fashioned tie tack in the shape of a pistol.\n\nHe has been married to the same woman for 58 years. He is a doting grandfather.\n\nAnd he is a right-wing rock star.\n\nHis friend, the political consultant Jason Rose, calls him, “A PR genius and a freak of political nature.”\n\nHe speaks in bumper-sticker slogans.\n\nHe reduces reality to good and evil — and he is the good guy who goes after the bad guys.\n\n“He says it like it is to the average people,” said Bruce Merrill, a pollster and former professor at Arizona State University. “Older folks see crime on TV, they see immigration. A guy like Joe symbolically saves them. It’s kind of like he’s a superhero.”\n\nHe has garnered national attention, national admiration, national loathing.\n\nHe has embarked on quixotic crusades that have endeared him or villainized him to Maricopa County residents and national pundits alike. He tilts at windmills, whether questioning if President Barack Obama was born abroad, filing suit in federal court over Obama’s immigration policies, or waging war on illegal immigrants — which has landed him and the county in legal hot water.\n\n“He spends millions of dollars on things that are not his job,” former Maricopa County Manager David Smith said.\n\nAnd indeed Arpaio has expanded the scope of the office beyond its principal job description of jail keeper. During his tenure, the sheriff became an immigration officer, a crusader against county corruption and an investigator of presidents.\n\nAs a result, Joe Arpaio may also be “America’s Most Expensive Sheriff.”\n\nLegal battles have cost Maricopa County taxpayers $142 million\n\nSince Arpaio first took office in 1993, cases involving him or his office have cost taxpayers $142 million in legal expenses, settlements and court awards, and yet he has been repeatedly re-elected.\n\n“I know I’ve been sued a few times,” he said with a shrug.\n\nIn fact, he has been sued more than a few times.\n\nThere were enormous court awards for deaths in the jails, some of which were so large they were paid by insurance companies, instead of the county.\n\nHis deputies arrested journalists for writing about him, and taxpayers paid for it.\n\nHe arrested and a former county attorney filed charges against sitting judges, supervisors and county employees in 2008 and 2009. All of the cases fell apart. All of the targets sued and settled.\n\nHe is currently facing contempt of court in the wake of a racial-profiling and civil-rights lawsuit brought in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. And because Arpaio failed to follow the judge’s orders in that case — and may have had the judge investigated — the major question remaining is whether he will be found in civil or criminal contempt.\n\nThose hearings resume Sept. 24 in front of that judge, U.S. Dictrict Court Judge G. Murray Snow.\n\nAn overlapping federal lawsuit lodged by the U.S. Department of Justice against Arpaio has already cost millions to defend. But taxpayers got a break there, since Arpaio and the county supervisors settled most of its issues out of court.\n\nNonetheless, Arpaio plans to run for re-election in 2016.\n\nHe does what he wants.\n\nArpaio likes the job of sheriff because he is his own boss.\n\n“I don’t have to report to any city manager, mayor, governor,” he said. “I have the right to make decisions.”\n\nHe frequently says, “No one tells the sheriff what to do.”\n\nHis old flip phone goes off incessantly; its ring tone is Frank Sinatra singing “My Way” at a decibel level an 83-year-old man can hear from across that spacious office.\n\n“I don’t have any iPad, uPad,” he said as he pointed way across the room to his desk. “That’s my computer: a Smith Corona typewriter.”\n\nIronically, according to two of the county supervisors, much of the $40 million that the county will have to pay to bring the office into compliance with a court order from the federal racial-profiling case is for technology updates that should have been made years ago.\n\nHe brags that he gives money back from his budget every year, though he has averaged more than $6 million in lawsuits and legal expenses for every year he has been in office.\n\nBut no matter how much trouble he gets into, newspaper readers keep sending letters to The Arizona Republic saying that Sheriff Joe is the only person doing anything about immigration and crime.\n\nAs Merrill, the pollster, said, “It’s not what’s true or not, it’s the perception of things.”\n\nAnd Arpaio’s chief deputy, Jerry Sheridan, summed it up: “The sheriff is the face of law enforcement for a lot of people in this county.”\n\nMany in Arpaio’s own party think it’s time for him to retire\n\nHe was once the most popular politician in the state, with an approval rate above 70 percent. That has slipped recently to 38 percent. He squeaked through his last election, in 2012, with 50.7 percent of the vote, leaving political watchers to wonder if this is the end of his run.\n\nThere are plenty of politicians from his own party who think it is time for him to leave. They complain about his disregard for the law, his lack of understanding of investigation procedure, of probable cause, his office’s history of putting opponents under surveillance.\n\nRumors that his deputies were following perceived enemies first surfaced in 1999, when a law-enforcement union told federal investigators the Sheriff’s Office was tailing a county attorney, an attorney who had sued him and a federal judge. In 2010, he even had an investigator for the State Bar followed. Arpaio staged an immigration raid on Mesa City Hall that embarrassed that city’s police chief.\n\nSome former prosecutors, all Republicans like Arpaio, would rather see him retire.\n\n“He’s a malicious influence in law enforcement,” said former U.S. Attorney for Arizona Paul Charlton. “It is time for this guy to step down and leave, and it’s certainly time for the voters to ask him to leave.”\n\n“It’s way past time for Arpaio to go,” said former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a Republican. “It’s amazing to me that so-called conservatives will look the other way when someone has abused the power of government in the most extreme fashion.”\n\nAnd former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, another Republican, said, “I’m not sure he came into office with the primary interest of the public good. That was secondary to what he wanted to do, which was promote Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArpaio denies that he craves publicity, but his friends and enemies say otherwise.\n\nHis office has been the set and subject of countless TV shows. He let the action-movie star Steven Seagal stage a reality show with one of his posses. The big coffee table in the waiting area outside of Arpaio’s office is covered with magazines bearing his face, most of them captioned “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” which Arpaio claims was coined by the TV show “60 Minutes.”\n\nArpaio’s two books extol his exploits as a cop in Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas and his swashbuckling days as a federal drug agent in Turkey and Latin America. He arrests the bad guys because he is a two-fisted individual who follows his own rules.\n\nAnd by living up to that reputation, he is now facing contempt of court — or worse.\n\nInside Sheriff’s Office headquarters, people seem alternately cocksure and anxious about whether Arpaio and his top deputies will be found in criminal contempt, whether there will be another Department of Justice criminal investigation into the office, like the one started in 2008, during the George W. Bush presidential administration, and dropped in 2012.\n\nThe contempt allegations, in part, were raised because Arpaio and his chiefs ignored the initial court order to stop racially profiling Latinos, essentially seeking out illegal immigrants under the guise of legitimate traffic stops.\n\nHis attorneys so far have failed in their bid to get the federal judge to recuse himself from the case because the judge questioned a pair of apparent investigations involving the judge and his wife. Arpaio is appealing the ruling.\n\nThose attorneys in the racial-profiling suit would like him to lie low on immigration matters. He cannot.\n\nSheriff defends Donald Trump at Phoenix campaign rally\n\nThough he claims not to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy, Arpaio defended remarks by the billionaire real-estate mogul that Mexicans are rapists and criminals, flowing through the border like water.\n\nTrump expanded on his anti-illegal-immigrant rant at his July Phoenix rally in front of nearly 5,000 angry “patriots” who cheered at every claim he made.\n\nArpaio took the podium before Trump, introduced in circus-barker terms as “The Greatest Lawman on Earth.”\n\n“We got a couple things in common,” he began. “The (Obama) birth certificate: He investigated it; I did. We both want to do something about the illegal immigrants.”\n\nThe crowd cheered. Then without irony, Arpaio said, “Isn’t this great in America, where anyone can run for president?”\n\nEven billionaires, one supposes. The crowd cheered again.\n\n“And second: freedom of speech,” he said, laying the words out like a bullet point.\n\nNever mind that a half-hour later, a group of young protesters would be swarmed by rally attendees when they tried to unfurl an anti-Trump banner. They were then escorted out of the conference hall by security guards, again to cheers.\n\nJoe Arpaio: ‘I won’t surrender and I won’t quit’\n\nDespite the ongoing contempt hearings relating to racial profiling, Arpaio’s publicity machine still sends out solicitations for campaign money in exchange for Arpaio’s continued vigilance on the immigration front.\n\n“Meanwhile, I’ve become the target of defeat because of my support for enforcing illegal immigration laws! This is nothing but pure politics,” said one recent pitch. “But I won’t surrender. And I won’t quit.\n\n“I don’t care if it’s the ACLU, liberal attorneys or these extreme open-border groups that want to see me gone. I’ve been the Sheriff for over 22 years and I took an oath to protect and defend both the Constitutions of the state of Arizona and the United States — and I will do that for as long as I am in office.”\n\nThe reward for contributing $100 to his campaign, the e-mail goes on to say, is a personally autographed photo.\n\nBut during the interview in his office, Arpaio’s attorney was sitting at his side to make sure he didn’t speak too freely. And when the subject of the pending contempt-of-court hearings came up, Arpaio suddenly went quiet.\n\n“I would love to talk to you,” he said. “Do you really think I don’t want to tell you? It frustrates me.”\n\nHe stopped pounding the table. His hands dropped to his lap and fidgeted nervously.\n\nHe seemed to ponder the legal fight ahead, if only for a moment.\n\nBut he soon returned to defiance; weeks later, U.S. marshals raided Arpaio’s headquarters because he still had not turned over evidence as ordered by the judge in the racial-profiling case.\n\nCue the music: “I did it my way.”\n\nJoseph Michael Arpaio has been a loner all his life.\n\n“The day I was born, my mother died in childbirth,” he has said more than once.\n\nHis parents were immigrants from Naples, Italy. His father ran a grocery store in Springfield, Mass. Since Arpaio was motherless and his father was busy at work, he was shuttled around the neighborhood from one Italian family to another.\n\n“There was a lot of discipline,” the Maricopa County sheriff told The Arizona Republic in 2002. “I don’t remember what I did to get whacked. I can’t actually tell you why.”\n\nA childhood friend told The Republic that Arpaio was withdrawn as a kid. Arpaio himself claims he was a mediocre student.\n\nPerhaps he has always been fearless as well.\n\nWhen he graduated from high school, he joined the Army and was sent to France. After three years in the service, he mustered out as a sergeant and landed a job walking a police beat in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere he met his wife, Ava Lamb, to whom he has been married for almost 58 years. They have two children, a son and a daughter. (As a matter of full disclosure, the daughter is married to the editor of the editorial pages for The Arizona Republic.)\n\nMost of what we know about Arpaio’s career as a cop and a federal agent is of his own telling in his two books, “Sheriff Joe Arpaio: America’s Toughest Sheriff,” published in 1996, and “Joe’s Law,” published in 2008.\n\nActually, Arpaio didn’t write either of them, and he has said he hasn’t even read them. As recently as this year, he denied he said some of the things in the books when they came up in a court of law.\n\nInstead, they were written by an author named Len Sherman, who works in Arpaio’s office. Sherman captures the grandiosity of Arpaio’s voice and the bravado of his tales. Some critics have postulated that the stories are embellished.\n\n“He has press clippings from everything he ever did,” Sherman said, except perhaps a claim that when Arpaio was a police officer in Las Vegas, he once made Elvis Presley pull over on his motorcycle and then, instead of issuing a citation, took him back to the station to sign autographs for the boys.\n\nDuring interviews, Arpaio opened file drawers in his office to show commendations, newspaper stories, even reports he typed up while he worked overseas for the federal Bureau of Narcotics. Arpaio remembers the names of perpetrators he arrested 60 years ago.\n\nWalking a beat in a tough D.C. neighborhood, the Arpaio voice of the books said, Arpaio knew the good guys and the bad guys, “the lone lawman striding down main street at high noon, taking on all comers.”\n\n“Not that everybody was glad to see me,” he wrote. “Given my gung-ho disposition, I didn’t wait for somebody else to let me know a crime was being committed. I did my own footwork, my own investigating, and I took matters into my own hands.\n\n“Not for nothing did I ‘win’ the title of ‘Most Assaulted Cop in D.C.’ in 1957, with a grand total of 18 serious encounters — not a little pushing and shoving, not a couple of taps and it was over, but full-out battles.”\n\nHe used his blackjack and nightstick 'without hesitation'\n\nIt was a time before “modern sensibility,” when it was OK to break heads, and Arpaio (as channeled by Sherman) extolled the bone-crushing properties of his police-issued blackjack and the reliability of his nightstick, “... and I used both without hesitation and whenever necessary, which was often.”\n\nArpaio spent three years on the D.C. police force, then six months in Las Vegas, before he was drawn to Chicago to work for the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThat agency threw him onto the street without wasting any time sending him to “special Treasury school to get indoctrinated into the ways and means of my new job.”\n\nHe spent four years in Chicago, using his wits to bust drug dealers, playing “a hundred roles, with a thousand stories to accompany them,” and earning the nickname “Nickel-Bag Joe,” because there was no bust too small.\n\nThen in the early 1960s, he was shipped out to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nArpaio’s stories from Turkey are glorious, as he travels to “the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing but trouble and danger. ... One day I’m meeting with the president of Turkey, the next day I’m shooting it out with bandits in the hinterlands.”\n\nHe repeatedly extols his disregard for the rules. He single-handedly takes 30-some Turkish opium farmers into custody, “which I mention quite incidentally, I had no authority to do.” After a shootout in which two drug dealers were killed, he angered the local governor, who “had not been properly forewarned and advised of my investigation,” and was accused of murder until the American embassy stepped in.\n\nThe typed reports he keeps in his office from those days document the gun battles and describe hauls of opium and morphine base in quantities up to a ton that he confiscated while working with Turkish law enforcement.\n\nHe ran out of bullets but still got the bad guy\n\nAfter three years in Turkey, the agency transferred Arpaio to Washington, D.C.\n\nSeveral newspaper articles in his files tell of a 1968 bust in Virginia when he shot it out with drug dealers while his partner was hiding in a car trunk.\n\nThe drug dealers had a gun to Arpaio’s head; Arpaio lunged for the weapon, and a melee began. Then, Arpaio, who describes himself as a lousy shot, ran out of bullets, but he managed to talk the drug dealers into surrendering to him anyway.\n\nBy 1970, he was abroad again, this time based in Mexico as director for regional operations, sending other agents to bust the bad guys in Latin America, dealing with corrupt leaders, he claims, and tracking a French drug mastermind to Paraguay.\n\nHe consulted with the U.S. ambassador in Paraguay, “and the ambassador told me I couldn’t work operationally on the ground or with the local police.”\n\nArpaio’s response: “Of course I can operate.”\n\nHe sent a covert crew on an unmarked government jet.\n\n“The son of a bitch might have been smart, but he was easy pickings,” Arpaio/Sherman wrote, referring to the French drug impresario. Working with local officers, his agents snagged the Frenchman, and he was “hustled aboard the jet, which flew directly to Dallas, allowing us to forgo extradition problems between the two nations.”\n\nSo much for laws. The bad guy went to prison, according to the book.\n\nArpaio came back to the U.S. in 1973 and worked at the highest levels of the newly renamed Drug Enforcement Administration. He did stints in Washington, Boston, and finished out his career in Phoenix as special agent in charge of Arizona.\n\nAfter he retired in 1982, he went to work in Ava’s travel agency, where he arranged flights for extradited criminals for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and offered potential orbital flights into outer space at $52,000 a pop.\n\nThen, in 1992, when he was already 60 years old, Joe Arpaio decided to run for sheriff.\n\nIn August 1991, Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Wat Promkunaram Buddhist temple in Waddell, which served a mostly Thai community near Luke Air Force Base.\n\nThere they found nine bodies, face down in a circle, with their heads toward the center. They had been shot execution-style.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office was then under the leadership of Sheriff Tom Agnos, who had been in office for one four-year term. Detectives hustled to solve the crime, and they rushed to judgment, arresting four Tucson men on a tip provided by a mentally ill man.\n\n“The Tucson Four,” as they became known, were driven to Phoenix and cloistered in hotel rooms where MCSO detectives browbeat them until they confessed to murders they did not commit.\n\nOnly by coincidence did MCSO detectives stumble upon the real killers, Alex Garcia and Johnathan Doody, a pair of teenagers who met in a high-school ROTC club, and they forced confessions out of them, too, trying to tie them to the Tucson Four. Eventually, when it became obvious that the Tucson men were innocent, then-County Attorney Rick Romley dropped the charges.\n\nOne of the teens confessed and was sentenced to life in prison. The other was found guilty of first-degree murder by a jury, though a federal appeals court later threw out the conviction because of the forced confession. He was re-convicted in 2014. Maricopa County paid out more than $2 million for the false arrests. And Agnos was tarnished and vulnerable.\n\nJoe Arpaio came into the race touting his drug-fighting experience and promising to carry on that fight as sheriff. He swore he would serve only one term, a promise he now says was a mistake, and one that he obviously did not keep.\n\nBut voters were distressed by the Temple Murders and the ensuing scandal and lawsuits. Arpaio squeaked by Agnos in the Republican primary, winning by 6,000 votes, then won decisively in the general election.\n\nAlmost immediately, Arpaio burst into the public eye, and his legacy has been a litany of gimmicks.\n\nOne of his earliest publicity coups came after Arpaio realized inmates were stealing underwear and taking it home when they were released. Arpaio ordered that it be dyed pink. It created an uproar that appealed to Arpaio, and he began selling the pink underwear in shopping malls, where he would personally autograph it for adoring fans.\n\nThere were some unintended consequences: An Irish court refused to extradite a pedophile priest who had fled the U.S. after being charged with sex crimes in Phoenix; the court ruled that the pink underwear was demeaning and proof of Arpaio’s abuse.\n\nArpaio also wrangled Army surplus tents, which he erected at his Durango Jail to house DUI arrestees and other low-security offenders. It was dubbed “Tent City,” and if it got warm or was deemed harsh, Arpaio was routinely quoted as saying, “Jail is not a country club.”\n\nSheriff Joe holds a press conference for every new idea\n\nArpaio’s other get-tough measures were similarly touted.\n\nHe changed the jail uniforms to old-fashioned, black-and-white horizontal stripes, like something out of a cartoon. He sent prisoners, including women, out on the streets to work in chain gangs. He served up green bologna sandwiches to the inmates, banned Playboy and other men’s magazines from the jails, denied access to coffee or cigarettes and chose the music and TV shows for the inmates.\n\nHe held a press conference for each and every new idea.\n\nThe public loved the tough-guy stance — and also when Arpaio showed his soft side by housing homeless dogs in an air-conditioned section of an outdated jail.\n\nIt played well to national media. Arpaio installed webcams in the jails and invited every media outlet to tour them. There were reality shows about female deputies, documentaries about Arpaio himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the public largely ignored lurid deaths of prisoners at the hands of detention officers or other inmates, even though they ended in spectacular jury awards.\n\nIn 1996, a man named Scott Norberg died after being beaten and tied into a restraint chair in one of the jails; in 2001, a mentally disabled man named Charles Agster met a similar fate in a restraint chair. Their families were awarded more than $17 million combined.\n\nThe Department of Justice took notice, investigating jail conditions multiple times since 1995. Sometimes the investigations would be dropped, other times federal judges would take the side of prisoners. But Arpaio always claimed victory.\n\nAmong the sheriff’s statutory duties is the ability to stage a posse, and Arpaio created them for every occasion: cold cases, animal abuse, aerial search and rescue.\n\nMany of them were established as non-profit organizations that amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. The cold-case posse, for example, was the main player — and payor — in Arpaio’s investigation into President Barack Obama’s birthplace.\n\nNot all of his ideas passed muster with the law. When he announced early in his tenure that he would set up roadblocks around the county to stop drug smugglers, he came up against Romley, who told him the plan was not constitutional.\n\n“When he initially came to me, I told him ‘no’ on a number of questions,” Romley said. “He quit asking questions.”\n\nArpaio tangled with Romley again and again over the next 12 years, to the point where Arpaio tried to get Romley removed as his official lawyer under the statutes.\n\nNotable among the disagreements was a 2004 fight over a prostitution sting at massage parlors. Romley dropped 60 cases when it came to light that some of the deputies had gone nude and engaged in sex acts with the prostitutes they arrested.\n\nDo the duties of a sheriff include investigating the president?\n\nAccording to Arizona state statutes, the law-enforcement responsibilities of a county sheriff are vaguely defined as preserving the peace, arresting criminals and stopping riots.\n\nA sheriff’s main duties, as detailed in the statutes, are to attend the courts; keep the county jail operating and get the prisoners to court; do process serving; coordinate search and rescue missions; and take possession of the homes of deceased persons.\n\nArpaio expanded his duties to go off on political tangents, like investigating Obama’s birthplace and caring for abused pets. And he made himself the enforcer of state immigration law.\n\nPolicing illegal immigrants brought Arpaio to the nation’s attention — and to federal contempt-of-court hearings. Arizona was ground zero in a short-lived trend to write state laws to make up for a perceived lack of enforcement from the feds.\n\nBut immigration enforcement went from being the greatest asset to the biggest liability in Arpaio’s portfolio.\n\nHis second biggest liability was going after perceived enemies among elected officials and judges.\n\nThe third was a misunderstanding, perhaps disregard, of how public monies are spent and managed.\n\nAll three played out simultaneously between 2006 and 2010, and together, for better or for worse, they brought him to where he is today.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio once saw himself as a defender of immigrants. He had spent part of his career in Latin America, after all, and he claimed an affinity with Hispanics.\n\nIn April 2005, an Army reservist named Patrick Haab pulled a gun on five men he thought were illegal immigrants at a rest stop on Interstate 8. He made them lie down on the ground, and he called police.\n\nArpaio had Haab arrested.\n\n“Even law enforcement has to have probable cause before taking people out of their cars and telling them to lie on the ground. ... He threatened to kill them,” Arpaio told the media at the time. “He did not have the right to do what he did. How did he know they were illegal aliens?”\n\nBut County Attorney Andrew Thomas refused to press charges against Haab, saying that the immigrants and their smuggler had committed felonies by entering the country illegally. Haab, he said, had every right to make a citizen’s arrest.\n\nThe incident frosted relations between Arpaio and Thomas. Attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who would later work for both, claims that he brokered a truce between the two elected officials. That truce led to a disastrous collaboration.\n\n“We created a double-headed monster,” Wilenchik said.\n\nThomas had run for office with the brash promise that he could stop illegal immigration. Thomas helped pass the first state immigration laws in the country, working with Senate President Russell Pearce, who had once been Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nTo this day, Pearce remains a faithful Arpaio supporter. Soon, states across the union were passing their own immigration laws.\n\nArpaio takes center stage during anti-immigration fervor\n\nAnti-immigration fervor raged in Arizona. Arpaio, ever conscious of the public center of attention, signed on to the fight against immigration, and made it his own.\n\nIn 2006, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office investigated the first case to go to trial on Thomas’ theory that people sneaking into the state from Mexico could be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit human smuggling.\n\nThe case was dismissed after prosecutors rested because sheriff’s deputies had based their investigation entirely on the immigrants’ confessions, which is not enough to establish probable cause.\n\nNo other conspiracy to commit human-smuggling cases ever went to trial again, though many immigrants charged with the crime pleaded to lesser offenses and were deported.\n\nThe next year, 2007, Thomas and Arpaio helped the state Legislature push through the Employer Sanctions Law, creating consequences for businesses that hired illegal immigrants. The raids on businesses, ranging from furniture manufacturers to water parks, followed.\n\nDeputies arrested immigrants on felony charges of identity theft and forgery, ostensibly so that they could then build a civil case against the business (which rarely happened).\n\nArpaio or his chiefs would field complaints from citizens about Hispanic day workers gathering near businesses or about people speaking in Spanish in restaurants. Deputies and posse members were sent in saturation patrols to predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, pulling over drivers for cracked windshields, failure to use turn signals and other minor offenses and asking them for proof of citizenship.\n\nThen Arpaio held press conferences to publicize the raids and issued press releases to announce the arrests.\n\nUnder other laws pushed through by Thomas during that period, the illegal immigrants could be held without bond. The jails filled up.\n\nThe percentage of illegal immigrants arrested was exactly proportional to their presence in the general population, but their percentage in the jails swelled because they couldn’t be released like native citizens or legal immigrants who were charged with the same crimes. Arpaio touted the numbers as proof of the criminality of immigrants.\n\nBy 2007, immigration had become Arpaio’s main priority. That year, his office aligned with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in a program called 287(g), which allowed local law-enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law and gave them access to the federal database used to track and verify citizens and legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nAt the press conference to announce the new agreement, Arpaio took the microphone and mischaracterized what the program allowed his office to do.\n\n“Actually,” he said, “ours is an operation, whether it’s the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first. ... My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I’m not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.”\n\nThose words would come back to haunt him in court.\n\nReporter rides along with deputies determined to arrest immigrants\n\nOther law-enforcement agencies balked at arresting immigrants, which brought Arpaio and Thomas closer together.\n\nIn 2007, when they signed their agreement to implement the new law that imposed sanctions on employers who hired illegal immigrants, Thomas publicly praised his partner’s “track record of enforcing our immigration laws and not caving in to political correctness.”\n\nThomas issued legal opinions averring that MCSO’s crime-suppression sweeps did not constitute racial profiling and that they were being carried out according to protocol.\n\nDespite what he and Arpaio would claim at press conferences, at times the profiling seemed blatant.\n\nOn a hot April afternoon in 2008, I rode in an MCSO cruiser during a crime-suppression operation in Guadalupe, accompanying a male and a female deputy who had been yanked off the animal-abuse unit to look for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe deputies were looking every which way, trying to figure out whom they should pull over. They were following instructions to pull over cars only in Guadalupe, regretting that they had to ignore likely prospects across the street in Tempe and noting that when it got dark, they could pull over people on bicycles if they didn’t have lights on their handlebars.\n\nFinally, they started following a couple of teenagers in an old beater, tailing the car until the driver made a turn without signaling and they had a reason to pull him over. The driver looked Mexican. He didn’t have a driver’s license or a green card. They thought they had an arrest.\n\nThen the teenager took out his cellphone and called his mom, who drove to the scene of the traffic stop from her house a few blocks away. She was angry.\n\nShe showed the teen’s driver’s license to the deputies. The boy wasn’t Mexican, he was Yaqui, and he had been born in Arizona. He had simply left his license at home. The deputies got back in their car and drove on.\n\nArpaio showed up in Guadalupe that evening for his photo opportunity. He was caught completely off guard when Rebecca Jimenez, the town mayor, got in his face and complained about the harassment of her townspeople.\n\nHe was so annoyed at Jimenez that he withdrew his office’s police coverage of the town, which did not have its own police force.\n\nIt was not the first nor last time he tangled with a public official.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2006, Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools Sandra Dowling and her husband, Dennis, were coming home from a meeting with her attorney.\n\nThe meeting was related to her battle with the County Board of Supervisors over her pet project, the Thomas J. Pappas Schools for the Homeless, which were seen by the supervisors as an expensive budget drain.\n\nDowling had won the initial court battles proving that the elected officials on the Board of Supervisors could not tell another elected official how to run his or her office.\n\nMaricopa County officials called Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s office to say they thought deficits in Dowling’s budget came from misuse of funds, and MCSO served search warrants on Dowling’s office and her home.\n\nThe Dowlings’ daughter called to tell them someone had broken into the house.\n\nDowling told her, “Call the police.”\n\nThe daughter answered, “It is the police.”\n\nWhen Dowling and her husband arrived, she recalls, there were three helicopters and at least 35 Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies wearing SWAT team gear.\n\n“Every time I see Joe, he tells me there was only one helicopter, because they only had one,” Dowling said. She assumed the others were media helicopters.\n\nIt was cold, and Dowling was wearing a short-sleeved blouse, but when she tried to enter her house to get a sweater, she said, a deputy stiff-armed her and knocked her to the ground.\n\nShe called her lawyer, who told her to leave before she was arrested. She and Dennis went to a neighbor’s house and watched the raid on television.\n\n“You would have thought it was a murder scene from the media coverage,” she said.\n\nThey didn’t get back to their ransacked house until after 3 in the morning.\n\nEleven months later, Dowling was indicted on 25 criminal counts related to the operation of the Pappas Schools, including what investigators and prosecutors said was the theft of $1.9 million in public money.\n\nThe case was being prosecuted by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, but it passed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office when Arpaio began investigating Attorney General Terry Goddard on unrelated matters that never came to fruition.\n\nThe Dowling case fell apart, the charges were thrown out, and Dowling ultimately pleaded guilty to a Class 2 misdemeanor for giving a summer job to her daughter. She was sentenced to probation that expired when her term of office ended. She sued, alleging malicious prosecution, and was eventually granted a settlement of $250,000.\n\nIt was the first of the assaults on supposedly corrupt elected county officials.\n\nSheriff’s Office takes on Phoenix New Times owners\n\nNext Arpaio took on the media.\n\nIn 2007, Arpaio’s chief deputy, David Hendershott, ordered the arrest of the owners of Phoenix New Times, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.\n\nThree years earlier, the alternative news weekly had published an article that revealed the addresses of several properties owned by Arpaio. The story violated an obscure state law that makes it illegal to publish a law-enforcement officer’s address online; strangely, it is not illegal to publish such addresses in print.\n\nArpaio pushed County Attorney Andrew Thomas to press charges. Thomas appointed Dennis Wilenchik as special prosecutor. Wilenchik then issued a subpoena demanding documents related to the story and a list of the newspaper’s online readers.\n\nLacey and Larkin responded by defying grand-jury secrecy and revealing the contents of the subpoena\n\nDeputies showed up at their houses in the dead of night and threw them into dark SUVs with tinted windows and Mexican license plates. Although the two publishers were detained briefly, no charges were filed. They were ultimately awarded a $3.75 million settlement.\n\nThe immigration push also cost money, perhaps more money than the Sheriff’s Office had to spend.\n\nIn November 2007, just four months into its fiscal year, MCSO was already more than $1 million over its overtime budget for the year because of its practice of moving personnel around.\n\nOne of the solutions reached was to stop taking some jail inmates to their Superior Court hearings — which immediately angered the court’s presiding criminal judge.\n\nMaking sure that prisoners get to court is one of the sheriff’s main jobs; defendants are put in jail to make sure they get to court. Not allowing them to go to hearings raises constitutional issues and denies them due process.\n\nBut MCSO chiefs claimed they didn’t have enough detention officers to handle the court traffic, until they were reminded by the county supervisors that they had been given money to staff more officers than they had working. Sheriff’s chiefs and officers were dragged into contempt-of-court hearings.\n\nArpaio also began limiting jail visits by lawyers who were working with clients in custody, triggering another court battle.\n\nOther duties went untended.\n\nIt also came to light in 2007 that the office had failed to investigate hundreds of sex crimes, 60 percent of which were against minors.\n\nAn Arizona Republic series later found that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in some cases did not meet basic investigative standards like promptly following up with victims, doing early background checks on suspects, coordinating with other agencies and promptly presenting cases to prosecutors. Then the agency lost track of $600,000 to hire child-abuse investigators, and the money was never found.\n\nLater, Maricopa County finance staff would realize that over eight years, MCSO had misallocated $99.5 million by paying employees out of the wrong accounts and moving money around.\n\nThe failure to recognize basic accounting standards — in other words, that accounts are dedicated to specific purposes — launched the biggest political assault of Arpaio’s career.\n\nIn 2008, facing a slumping economy, the Board of Supervisors cut the sheriff’s budget.\n\nThe sheriff and Thomas responded with the newly formed “Maricopa County’s Anti-Corruption Effort,” also known as MACE.\n\nSuddenly, they were seeing corruption everywhere.\n\nSupervisor Stapley indicted on 118 counts, convicted of none\n\nIn December 2008, Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley was indicted on 118 felony and misdemeanor counts arising from omissions on annual financial statements he filed as an elected official.\n\nStapley did not think the financial statements were the real motive for the charges.\n\n“It was flat-out the budget,” Stapley said, and the charges were payback for the budget cuts, he thought, mostly at the request of Thomas and Hendershott, Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nHendershott took issue with $340 million in cash that had been set aside to build a new Superior Court building, averring that some of that money could be diverted to MCSO.\n\nWorking with Thomas, the Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation into the court, but Superior Court Presiding Criminal Judge Gary Donahoe declared a conflict and ordered Thomas off the case.\n\nThe animus heated up, with Thomas and MCSO on one side and the county management and Superior Court judges on the other.\n\nIn August 2009, sheriff’s deputies seized a county computer system, claiming that the county should not have access to certain law-enforcement data. Both sides sued.\n\nThe county yanked funding from Thomas and created its own civil-litigation unit because officials claimed that Thomas could no longer represent the county in court because of the ongoing litigation.\n\nBy September 2009, the charges against Stapley had been dismissed after it was discovered that the county had never actually instituted a requirement that supervisors file financial statements. Hendershott had Stapley arrested the next day in a county parking garage, referring him for charges on more than 95 new counts, including allegations of fraud related to campaign funds.\n\nThomas declined to prosecute, saying the case wasn’t ready.\n\nBut three months later, in December 2009, the hammer fell. Stapley was indicted on 22 charges. Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, a longtime critic of Arpaio, also was indicted on 36 charges alleging impropriety in taking loans from an agency the board had provided with funding. And Judge Donahoe was charged with bribery related to his rulings on the court tower.\n\nThen Arpaio and Thomas filed a civil-racketeering lawsuit in federal court against the Board of Supervisors and several Superior Court judges, including Donahoe, claiming they had conspired against them.\n\nBy March 2010, all of the charges and the lawsuits had been dismissed or dropped, triggering a tsunami of litigation.\n\nStapley’s case was also withdrawn, but Thomas did not give up on it.\n\nHe referred it to Gila County Attorney Daisy Flores, who concluded that Stapley may have committed fiscal transgressions, some of which might have been minor felonies, but that most of the charges were not crimes.\n\nFurthermore, Flores said that the investigation was so flawed and politically motivated that it could not be pursued.\n\n“The way in which the investigation and prosecution of Stapley progressed was fundamentally wrong, and to pursue further criminal actions against Stapley would be a miscarriage of justice,” Flores wrote.\n\n“The vast record is littered with behavior so egregious that a reasonable person’s sense of fairness, honesty and integrity would be offended. The (Gila County Attorney’s Office) is left with no choice but to decline this matter.”\n\nCounty officials win settlements of more than $8 million\n\nSupervisors Stapley, Wilcox and Andy Kunasek and Judge Donahoe sued; so did three other judges who had been targeted, several county employees and a business associate of Stapley.\n\nBy the time the dust cleared, taxpayers had paid more than $8 million in settlements, and more than $5 million in legal bills, plus another $6 million for other litigation in the cross-fighting.\n\nThomas and two of his deputy county attorneys were charged with ethics complaints by the State Bar of Arizona for their role in the attacks on judges and elected officials and were called before the Arizona Supreme Court’s disciplinary judge.\n\nBefore those hearings, it came out that sheriff’s deputies were tailing the Colorado attorneys who had been retained by the state Bar to investigate and prosecute, and the deputies in turn were tailed by FBI agents.\n\nThomas and one of his deputies were disbarred; the other was suspended from practicing law for six months.\n\nHendershott was fired.\n\nBut Arpaio came out unscathed.\n\nPeople in the Sheriff’s and County Attorney’s Offices were subjects of a federal investigation into abuse of power initiated during President George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nThe investigation was discontinued in September 2012 by U.S. Attorney for Arizona John Leonardo, who coincidentally had been the Pima County Superior Court judge who dismissed the criminal charges against Wilcox.\n\nIn a recent Republic interview with Arpaio, he cited that dismissed investigation as proof that the feds had nothing on him.\n\nBut civil-rights lawsuits had already been lodged by the American Civil Liberties Union and by the U.S. Department of Justice over an alleged pattern and practice of racial profiling against Latinos.\n\nTaxpayers would pay the cost.\n\nIn the thick of controversy, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio maintains a sense of humor and enjoys bantering with the press — even with reporters who have written unfavorable stories about him. Bad press is better than no press, and even negative stories make Arpaio’s supporters rally around him.\n\nHe is impulsive, which is, at once, his charm and his liability. He seems to have no filter, no self-censor, whether speaking to a convention or a reporter, a TV camera or a person on the street. He swears readily. He is always defiant.\n\nArpaio is facing contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop his immigration enforcement polices; hearings resume Sept. 24. The judge appointed a monitor to keep the office in compliance with orders in a federal racial profiling case.\n\nYet one afternoon, when the subject of his patented pink jail underwear came up, Arpaio turned to me and said, “I even gave a pair to the court monitor.”\n\n“Obviously, it hasn’t helped me any,” he said with a wink and a stagey smile.\n\nEncounters with the sheriff sometimes seem like surreal one-act plays.\n\nI first met him more than 20 years ago, at a north Phoenix department store where he was being fitted for a suit. I introduced myself and asked some long-forgotten reporter’s question.\n\nHe looked me in the eyes, scrunched up his face, and out of nowhere, said, “You’re too good-looking to be a reporter.”\n\nIt was as if someone had set off flashbulbs in my face. I was stunned and didn’t know how to respond. The conversation ended quickly.\n\nFast-forward at least 15 years. I was walking under the covered walkway between the two Wells Fargo buildings in downtown Phoenix, where Arpaio used to have his offices.\n\n“Hey Mike, hey Mike,” he called out. “How come you write all those nice stories about Andy Thomas?” referring to the former Maricopa County attorney who was disbarred for his role in prosecuting judges and county officials.\n\nHe had told me more than once that he would give me an office in his building if I would write about him.\n\n“They aren’t nice, Sheriff,” I answered.\n\n“I’m Italian,” he said. “You know what nice is for me? I stick the knife in, but I don’t twist it.”\n\nJust then, Chief Deputy David Hendershott lumbered by, looking like he was trying to get through the door without having to talk to Arpaio.\n\n“Dave, you don’t return my calls,” Arpaio said. He walked over to him. Hendershott stood speechless and stared at him. Arpaio started pulling aside the lapels of Hendershott’s sport coat.\n\n“You got your new gun with you?” Arpaio asked Hendershott. “Show Mike your gun.”\n\n“Don’t make him shoot me, Sheriff,” I joked.\n\nArpaio chuckled.\n\n“Aw, it would do more damage if I told him to Tase you,” he said.\n\nHe has maintained that sense of humor and human engagement over the two decades I have known him and reported about him and his office. It is why he maintains a following despite his many trials.\n\nI was once contacted during the height of the immigration sweeps by a Mexican journalist who wanted to know more about Arpaio before she interviewed him. She intended to write a damning critique of his policies.\n\nShe got angry when I told her that regardless of her reporting and her outlook, if she interviewed him, she would end up liking him, at least on an interpersonal level.\n\nArpaio begins his day early, stays at the office late\n\nArpaio also has a strong work ethic. He begins his day early and stays in the office late. As a concession to his age, he said, he only gives a speech a day now instead of two. Insiders say he spends the last hours of his workday in his office on his couch thinking or strategizing with his brain trust, cooking up the next defense, the next diversionary tactic, the next press release.\n\n“I’m not planning, I’m doing paperwork,” he counters.\n\nAge does not slow him down.\n\n“If you’re talking about his energy and his mental capacity, I haven’t seen any changes,” said Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan. “He is on the ball about things that are important to him. He can remember things like nobody I have ever met in my life.”\n\nExcept perhaps when he is on the witness stand. During the current contempt-of-court proceedings, as in the disciplinary hearings that led to former County Attorney Thomas’ disbarment, Arpaio was suddenly forgetful and couldn’t recall details.\n\nAttorney Michael Manning, who has become a wealthy man representing wrongful-death and civil-rights cases against the Sheriff’s Office, laughs when he recalls the explanation for memory lapses when Arpaio is on the witness stand.\n\n“In all of the cases I’ve had with him in front of a jury,” Manning related, “he said, ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got the flu.’ ”\n\nOn the stand, Arpaio says that he delegates day-to-day management to others. But as Sheridan said, he is on the ball about “things that are important to him” — which have become more eccentric.\n\nHis office brushed aside death threats made against attorneys in the Jodi Arias case, but when someone threatened CNN trial maven Nancy Grace, he sent investigators to make an arrest and got a conviction — even though the threat maker was in New York state and the person threatened was in Atlanta.\n\nIn his book, “Arpaio: De Facto Lawman,” former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands wrote that Arpaio does not understand basic concepts like probable cause.\n\n“In reality, Arpaio wasn’t really running anything,” Sands wrote. “He just wasn’t paying attention. Instead he concentrated on running a full-time political campaign throughout his tenure in office,” Sands wrote.\n\nThe office was “constant managed chaos and damage control,” he wrote. “If it created controversy, Arpaio enjoyed the media attention.”\n\nAllegation that he doesn’t really like animals stings\n\nSands claims Arpaio is obsessed with death threats and once made deputies seize a pay phone from which a threat was made and run fingerprint tests on all the coins in the coin box, even though detectives told him it would serve no purpose.\n\nAnd he likes conspiracies, real or imagined: an improbable plot to kill him, involving the Mexican Zetas, the Minutemen vigilantes on the border, and a Phoenix Hispanic activist, for example, which Arpaio describes in one of his own books. Or conspiracies involving President Barack Obama and the federal government.\n\nIn his book, Sands recalls the day when a “tea party” group begged Arpaio to investigate whether Obama was born outside the United States, something Sands thought had already been settled. Arpaio referred to that investigation at the Donald Trump rally in July as if it were still ongoing.\n\nSands also said that despite Arpaio’s animal posse and well-publicized care of homeless dogs, Arpaio does not really like animals. It is the allegation that seemed to most upset Arpaio during an interview, and he said he did not have dogs because he did not feel it was safe for his wife to walk them because of security risks.\n\n“I have security issues I don’t want to get into,” he said.\n\nBut Arpaio has had many lesser leaps of logic over the years that I witnessed.\n\nIn 2007, at the time when MCSO stopped bringing jail prisoners to court, ostensibly to save money, Arpaio got called for jury duty, and his publicity people sent out press releases about how the sheriff was going to do his civic duty, just like any other citizen.\n\nArpaio’s panel was canceled, but he showed up anyway. And his office invited reporters to take advantage of the photo op, ignorant of two facts: You can’t shoot photos in the court hallways, and you can’t photograph jurors.\n\nI walked into the hallway on the seventh floor of the old East Courthouse; I had an office a floor above. I touched Arpaio’s arm as I walked past, and he jumped and didn’t recognize me.\n\nMinutes later, he suddenly noticed me.\n\n“Hey, Mike, hey Mike,” he called to me, and then he chatted about his impending jury service.\n\nI brought up the prisoners who weren’t making it to court, and how that amounted to denying their constitutional right to due process under the law, and Arpaio said it was the first he had heard of it. The next day, the policy seemed corrected, at least for a while.\n\nArpaio: Respect for those who come here legally\n\nDecisions can seem illogical, though it is difficult to tell if they come from Arpaio or from elsewhere in his office.\n\nIn 2007, a court interpreter named Ramon Delgadillo called to tell me that MCSO had instituted a new policy at the jail, requiring naturalized citizens to prove they were citizens.\n\nDelgadillo, a well-respected, 25-year employee of the county, was just going to the jail to do his job, but he was not allowed onto the premises because he did not have his naturalization papers. Naturalized citizens are not required to carry them.\n\nI called Arpaio. He said he was not aware of the policy, though he had ordered that no illegal immigrants would be allowed in the jails to visit anyone. But he bluffed anyway, and said that no one had a constitutional right to go into the jail.\n\nI asked him what papers he had in his wallet that proved that he was a citizen. He thought about it. Then, as we were speaking, he acknowledged that his own parents were naturalized citizens.\n\nThe next morning, I got a phone call from Arpaio’s public-information officer, who told me that Arpaio had rescinded the policy. I called him again.\n\n“I do have a deep respect for those who come here legally, like my mother and father who came from Italy, went through the system and became naturalized,” Arpaio said. “I have a deep respect for them. That’s one reason I’m going to change this policy.”\n\nBy 2010, the federal government and the federal courts would start changing the rest of his immigration policies.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s crusade against illegal immigration launched him from a late-show punchline to a national figure.\n\nStarting in 2005, Arizona was in the vanguard of states looking for local solutions to a national immigration problem. Arpaio was Arizona’s most visible enforcer.\n\nBut then, one by one, the state’s immigration laws that had propelled Arpaio into the national spotlight were disassembled by the federal courts.\n\nMost of the provisions in the multilayered and controversial Arizona immigration legislation called Senate Bill 1070, were blocked by a U.S. District Court judge in Phoenix in July 2010, before they could go into effect.\n\nTwo years later, the only part that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed back into the law books was a statute allowing police to inquire about the citizenship of people after they were stopped for other reasons.\n\nLater, the concept of charging immigrants as conspirators for smuggling themselves into the country was knocked down, and then the entire “coyote,” or human-smuggling, law was thrown out. So was the law requiring that illegal immigrants arrested on felony charges be held without bond.\n\n“Don’t blame me for that,” Arpaio said. “It was a federal decision.”\n\nAlso in 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice yanked the 287(g) certification for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office— the program that allowed MCSO to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union’s racial-profiling lawsuit was filed in 2007, on behalf of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican tourist who was in the country legally, but was detained for nine hours as if he were an illegal immigrant.\n\nOther Hispanics who had been arrested during immigration-control operations joined in and it became a class action.\n\nArpaio meets his match: Judge G. Murray Snow\n\nIn 2011, U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow ordered Arpaio to stop enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nThe case went to trial in 2012, and in May 2013, Snow issued his findings: Arpaio and his staff had reacted to complaints about Mexicans gathering, especially day laborers, and staged their saturation patrols and raids accordingly, Snow found.\n\nThe deputies, Snow determined, used race as a major factor in deciding whom to pull over and whom to question. And even after MCSO’s 287(g) authority was revoked, Arpaio still told deputies they could enforce federal immigration law and that being in the country illegally was a crime, instead of what Snow called “an administrative violation of federal immigration law.”\n\nIn October 2013, Snow ordered the Sheriff’s Office to cease its immigration-control operations, submit to oversight by a “court monitor,” and update its technology to include cameras and data collection.\n\nThen, a year after the order, Snow brought Arpaio and his chiefs back into court.\n\nArpaio admitted that he and his deputies had continued to enforce federal immigration law for 18 months after being ordered not to, and that they had failed to turn over video and audio evidence.\n\nThe contempt-of-court hearings continued into the spring of this year, when the bombshell dropped.\n\nOn April 23, Arpaio was on the witness stand, when Snow suddenly asked him about two stories from Phoenix New Times.\n\nOne story claimed that Arpaio had sent a private investigator to look into whether Snow’s wife had told an acquaintance that Snow didn’t like Arpaio and wanted him out of office.\n\nThe other story alleged that Arpaio had an investigator in Seattle researching supposed CIA data showing connections and communications between the judge, then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others. Arpaio acknowledged both investigations, but claimed that the information obtained was “junk.”\n\nArpaio’s lawyers subsequently asked Snow to remove himself from the case; the contempt hearings ground to a halt pending Snow’s decision. The investigations revealed conflicts of interest, they now claimed. And Snow asking about them raised even more conflict, they wrote in their motion.\n\nThen, on July 10, Snow denied the motion and refused to step down. For one thing, he wrote in his order, MCSO and Arpaio had been aware of the supposed conflicts of interest for more than a year and had deemed them unreliable. To bring them up again at this point in the contempt hearings, Snow wrote, was a deliberate delay and an “attempted manipulation.”\n\nArpaio appealed the ruling.\n\nSources inside MCSO say that those investigations never really took place, and that things are not what they seem.\n\nThe tip that Snow’s wife was bad-mouthing Arpaio at a Tempe restaurant was checked out by a private investigator, and then MCSO lawyers advised the office to just forget about it. It was put aside.\n\nA return of the birther investigator\n\nThe bigger stink that Arpaio was investigating links between Snow and the Department of Justice came out of another whimsical undertaking.\n\nDennis Montgomery, a Seattle-based computer expert who had worked on the birther investigation — that is, Arpaio’s probe into President Barack Obama’s birthplace — told MCSO that he had proof that the federal government was illegally gathering information about American citizens, including many from Maricopa County.\n\nJust as in the birther investigation or the unsuccessful federal lawsuit against Obama’s immigration policies, Arpaio had another chance to defy the president on behalf of the little guy.\n\nBut MCSO brass sent deputies to keep Montgomery on task. Myriad e-mails among Montgomery, his lawyer and MCSO supervisors chide Montgomery for dumping data and videos he had gathered from multiple sources, including Al-Jazeera, the Arabic news network. And when the office reached the point that they were going to cut Montgomery loose, he upped the ante and produced a “flowchart” alleging communication among Snow, Holder, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona, and others.\n\nBy then, more than $120,000 had been paid to Montgomery, and MCSO’s attorneys and top brass wanted to pull the plug. But the document got out into the light and was unsealed in the court record.\n\nSnow was not convinced. In his ruling, he noted that based on e-mails provided by MCSO, the Montgomery investigation continued up until the “eve” of the contempt hearings.\n\nAnd he noted that even after denouncing both investigations as “junk,” Arpaio’s lawyers still tried to use them to remove Snow from the case.\n\nNor does history help the sheriff’s case.\n\nArpaio clearly has a record of investigating and suing judges who made rulings he did not like.\n\nAnd it is noteworthy that former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands, in his book, claims that Arpaio believed that his investigation of Obama’s birthplace would create a conflict with federal authorities that would protect him from legal action.\n\nAccording to Sands, after launching that apparently ongoing investigation, Arpaio said, “Now let them go after me with this abuse-of-power thing.”\n\nArpaio denied making the statement.\n\n“I knew it would make it worse for me,” he said.\n\nCounty officials detail Sheriff’s Office’s legal costs\n\nAccording to county officials and other sources, Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office have been the reason for more than $142 million in payouts for settlements, court awards and attorneys’ fees since Arpaio took office.\n\nThe county’s Risk Management Department, which is its self-insurance program, has paid more than $78 million in settlements, awards and litigation since Arpaio took office in 1993. Less than half of that, $30 million, is actually for jail claims, and another nearly $20 million was paid out for traffic accidents, boating accidents and other small claims.\n\nThe rest of the risk-management figure, more than $28 million, was paid for legal matters listed as civil-rights violations, false arrest, conspiracy and malicious prosecution, which would include the Dowling, Phoenix New Times and county-wars settlements.\n\nBut there’s more.\n\nThe county Office of Management and Budget has paid out another $6.2 million for other legal costs of the county wars.\n\nThe Department of Justice lawsuit has already cost nearly $5 million. Like the Melendres racial-profiling case, it alleged civil-rights violations and discrimination against Latinos in traffic stops, and the judge on that case accepted the Melendres conclusions to rule that racial profiling indeed took place. That suit also alleged discrimination in the jails and raids on work sites as well. And it addressed Arpaio’s retaliation against the other elected and appointed county officials.\n\nBut the county and the Department of Justice settled most of the rest of the case out of court, because Arpaio had already changed the office’s immigration policies (if not his personal opinions), sidestepping more costly litigation.\n\nBy next year, the cost of the Melendres case will reach $52.5 million, plus attorney costs to be determined. And Snow is talking about holding another trial to determine compensation for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe county’s running total as of Aug. 31: $142,040,779, of which $91,934,494, nearly two-thirds, is because of Arpaio’s court and political battles.\n\nBut those figures only show how much money was paid out by the county. The total legal expenses are actually higher. At times, there were co-defendants in the lawsuits who had to pay a share of a jury award of settlement. And awards over $5 million, like the two wrongful-death cases involving restraint chairs in the jails, were paid by insurance, with the county only paying a deductible of $1 million or $2 million.\n\nOnly two of the Maricopa County supervisors criticized Arpaio for the financial cost.\n\n“I personally get the feeling that enough’s enough,” said Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board’s lone Democrat, who is in the first year of his first term. “The board is tired of shelling out millions of dollars for things that are not his job. He’s not even doing his job.”\n\n“We have a laundry list of projects and we can’t do them because of the sheriff,” Gallardo said.\n\nSupervisor Andy Kunasek, the only supervisor still in office who was targeted by Arpaio and former County Attorney Andrew Thomas during the county wars, said, “If, God forbid, I was sheriff, I’d exit now with as much grace as possible, because it’s not going to get any better.”\n\nThe other three sitting supervisors were more careful in their remarks.\n\n“As a fiscal conservative, I don’t like having the county spending money on things that we shouldn’t have to pay for,” said County Board Chairman Steve Chucri, before pointing out that Arpaio is an elected official.\n\nThe board has no power to remove him, and the county battles of 2008-10 came largely out of the board’s attempt to control Arpaio and Thomas through their budgets. Yet at the same time, the county is responsible for paying Arpaio’s legal expenses, even if it cannot stop the actions that led to lawsuits.\n\nSupervisor Denny Barney raised the same point.\n\n“In my mind, we’ve got the Melendres issue and the DOJ issue, but we’ve got a unique constitutional constraint in this county in that we have an elected sheriff whose budget is set by a board,” Barney said.\n\nTo wit: Sheriffs are appointed in many parts of the country. In recent years, sheriffs in Denver and Philadelphia were removed or resigned after high-money legal settlements.\n\nSupervisor Clint Hickman dodged the question.\n\n“I am going to continue to help a relationship that my district has with (Arpaio’s) command staff and his patrol officers.”\n\nArpaio sees the cost as part of the job.\n\n“When you run a big organization, whether you’re the president of the United States, you will have personnel problems,” he said. “When you run a jail system all these years, and also we run enforcement, when you nail it down, I don’t know if you can say it’s out of line.”\n\nOn June 9, a few days before his 83rd birthday, Joe Arpaio held a party at his headquarters on Jackson Street to celebrate being the longest-serving sheriff in Maricopa County history after 221/2 years.\n\n“It’s really emotional to have survived all these years,” he told the adoring audience.\n\nHe was presented a giant Stetson cowboy hat with the words “Longest Serving Sheriff in Maricopa County History” on the side, and when they sat it on his head, it came down over his ears.\n\nThen he was handed a Smith & Wesson pistol engraved with the words “America’s Toughest Sheriff” and an image of his sheriff’s badge.\n\nState historian Marshall Trimble, who was making the presentations, then said, “He’s got to have a caballo.”\n\n“Do I have to ride it?” Arpaio asked. “Let’s go and say hello.”\n\nOutside, a brown horse with a white face was waiting. Arpaio held the reins and stroked the horse’s face as the cameras whirred and snapped. Then the fans and admirers gathered to take selfies with America’s Toughest Sheriff. (The horse, incidentally, went home with its real owner that night, not Arpaio. It had been another prop for a photo op.)\n\nA reporter stuck a tape recorder in Arpaio’s face and asked, “What do you think your legacy will be?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m not dead yet,” he snapped back, before heading back inside to eat cake.\n\nAnother day, another protest, another demand for his resignation\n\nA month later, there was a different sort of gathering over Arpaio’s legacy.\n\nIn mid-July, a Hispanic activist group called Puente staged a protest asking for Arpaio to resign, marching the eight blocks from the downtown Phoenix Convention Center to the Fourth Avenue Jail.\n\nArpaio locked the jail down hours before the march even began. Defense attorneys gathered a few blocks away, outside the Office of the Legal Defender and the Office of the Legal Advocate, two of the county’s public-defender agencies, wondering why they could not get into the jail to see their clients. They mostly shook their heads as if this were just another day in Maricopa County.\n\nThe march was more than just the usual suspects. Puente organizers took advantage of a gathering of a politically progressive organization called Netroots Nation, which was meeting for its annual conference.\n\nA group of 500 to 600 mostly Anglo and mostly young people stretched for blocks as it marched down Jefferson Street, chanting, “Arrest Arpaio, not the people,” wearing T-shirts that said, “Arpaio-free AZ” or “Adelante (Forward) AFL-CIO.” They carried signs that said, “I have a concentration camp and it’s called Tent City,” and “ICE out of 4th Ave Jail.”\n\nThey were flanked by Phoenix police officers in squad cars, on motorcycles and bicycles, and on foot.\n\nWhen they reached Fourth Avenue, the protesters turned south, where they were met at the jail by fewer than a dozen Arpaio supporters, mostly senior citizens, carrying American flags and holding “We support Arpaio” signs. The marchers circled the block around the jail and then marched on to Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office headquarters a few blocks away.\n\n“Once again, it’s to tell Arpaio to resign,” said Carlos Garcia, from Puente. “We’re here to ask Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get out of there and to shut down Tent City and get justice for Arpaio victims.”\n\nMCSO deputies stood quietly in front of Arpaio’s fortress watching the protesters.\n\nSome soul-searching from inside the Sheriff’s Office\n\nSome protest comes from within the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAt a routine morning meeting in March, Arpaio surprised his deputy chiefs by asking them if they thought he should stay in office.\n\n“Should I run for sheriff — for the seventh time?” he asked them.\n\nIt was more a declaration than a moment of soul-searching as they sat around the giant oblong conference table in Arpaio’s vast office.\n\nThe four deputy chiefs in the room on that March morning agreed that he should stay. Deputy Chief Jack MacIntyre recalls answering, “That’s a decision for you and your wife.”\n\nThe only person in the room with second thoughts was Public Information Officer Lisa Allen, who thought that the strain would be great on Arpaio and his family, especially because of the media.\n\nArpaio’s mind was already made up. “Not that it matters what they answer,” he told me.\n\nBut a month later, another deputy chief, Brian Lee, began circulating a letter asking Arpaio to either resign or stand down for re-election. No one would sign, and Lee was determined to talk to the sheriff himself to tell him it was time to go.\n\n“He spoke with a number of other chiefs, writing things down. ‘You should think about not running again,’ ” Allen claimed he said. “He did say to the sheriff that he felt it was not in his best interests to run again.”\n\nLee went to Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan for advice before talking to Arpaio. Sheridan didn’t want to see the letter Lee had prepared, and he told him to temper his remarks.\n\nArpaio doesn’t remember the conversation going that way.\n\n“He came in when there was a rumor going around,” Arpaio recalls. “He came in to say his opinion.”\n\nThe sheriff paused a moment.\n\n“Maybe some people think I should leave, and I understand that,” he said.\n\nBut his mind is made up.\n\n“Well, I’m running again,” he told The Arizona Republic a week after his longevity party. “It will be my seventh term.”\n\nHe didn’t say that it will be his final term.\n\n“I’m proud of the fact that I’m the longest-serving sheriff in the history of Maricopa County.”\n\n“What would be grounds for stepping down?” I asked, and the question befuddled him.\n\n“If I get shot or something. That would be the only thing that might make me not run. I’m running,” he said. “I’m not going to desert this organization.”\n\nHe did not think he would be forced to resign if found in contempt of federal court for defying a judge’s order to stop enforcing his immigration policies. His contempt hearing before U.S. district Court G. Murray Snow is scheduled to resume Thursday.\n\nRussell Pearce: ‘He’s doing the job we hired him to do’\n\nArpaio still has his supporters.\n\n“If a man is competent and is doing what he promised to do and what he’s supposed to do, then that man should stay in office,” said Russell Pearce, a former state senator and long-time Arpaio ally. “Arpaio is not a young man, but he’s competent, and he’s doing the job we hired him to do, so he should run.”He still has supporters.\n\nBut his popularity is fading. According to a Rocky Mountain Poll this March, the share of people polled who believe Arpaio is doing a good job had fallen to 38 percent. He won the 2012 general election with just 50.7 percent of the vote.\n\n“I think (Arpaio) is vulnerable,” pollster Earl DeBerge said.\n\nAnd the number of naysayers is growing.\n\nHis former self-proclaimed “attack dog,” attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who defended the Sheriff’s Office in the early days of the county battles, said he thinks Arpaio has overstayed his welcome.\n\n“He’s old. He’s not a bad guy personally, but it’s time to go. He’s an embarrassment to the state,” Wilenchik said.\n\n“His ego has gotten so big that even at his toughest time in his career, I don’t think he knows how to back down, how to see he’s wrong. I think we’re seeing the beginning of the end,” Supervisor Steve Gallardo said.\n\nArpaio’s friend, the public-relations guru Jason Rose, agrees with Gallardo to an extent.\n\n“It’s the exception not the rule that elected officials go out on their own terms. There’s a statute of limitations on electability,” Rose said. “Knowing the sheriff like I do, saying ‘I’m sorry’ and admitting things might be the toughest professional thing he’ll ever do.”\n\nRose points out that Arpaio’s enormous campaign war chest may once again save him at the polls. But his advice is to apologize for past mistakes.\n\n“Stare right into the camera and speak directly to the people,” Rose said. “Show a little more humility and a little less hubris, and it might go a long way for him.”\n\nEven Arpaio’s biographer, Len Sherman, wonders if reckoning day is coming for Arpaio.\n\n“You reap what you sow,” Sherman said. “If you’re going to do things the way you want, you might pay the consequences.”\n\nSherman didn’t think that would happen when he wrote the preface of Arpaio’s second book, Joe’s Law.\n\n“We quickly tire of our heroes, probably because they’re not really heroes at all. They appear, they glitter, they are everywhere, and then we learn the truth that they are nothing but false fronts ... (T)hey’re all part of the same media world we inhabit — and they’ve all disappointed us so many times that poll after poll demonstrates that we no longer trust any of our leading institutions.\n\n“And so to Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer did more than three dozen interviews over the past six months and read three books about Arpaio to report on this series.\n\nSince 2003, Kiefer has written more than 320 articles that included Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Here's why ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTeens are entering the chat around social media.\n\nAdults often stress about the anxiety, self-esteem issues and social comparisons that teenagers may encounter on social media, but a new study is asking teens what they are actually experiencing online and how they see it in their lives.\n\n“One of the things we really want to do with this larger work is bring teens’ own voices to the debate,” said the report’s lead author, Monica Anderson, associate director of research of the Pew Research Center’s internet and technology team. “This work really wants to shine light on: Teens are getting both positives from social media, but they’re also getting negative things as well.”\n\nResearchers with the Pew Research Center surveyed 1,316 teens across the United States ages 13 to 17 from mid-April to early May. The youths were asked about their thoughts, feelings and use of social media.\n\n“When it comes to new and emerging tech, teens are often at the vanguard of tech adoption,” Anderson said.\n\nOne theme of the survey’s results: Teens see their experience on social media as more positive than adults imagine it to be.\n\nOnly 27% said that their experience is even worse than their parents think — the rest said it was either about right or better, the survey said.\n\nIt makes sense that adult perspectives would be skewed, said Michelle Icard, a parenting educator and speaker and the author of “Fourteen Talks by Age Fourteen: The Essential Conversations You Need to Have With Your Kids Before They Start High School.”\n\n“Offloading their negative experiences with social media to parents is one of the ways tweens and teen cope,” she said via email. “Often, our kids report what went wrong in their day, in person or online, but they forget to come back and let us know when their issues resolved or stopped being painful. So, parents carry around worry long after kids have shrugged something off.”\n\nThe positives\n\nThe teens who responded to the survey said the good things they get out of social media include feeling connection and getting support from a community.\n\nIn total, 80% said social media gives them some level of connection to what is going on in their friends’ lives, 71% said it’s a place where they can show their creativity, 67% said social media reassures them that they have people to support them through tough times, and 58% said it makes them feel more accepted, according to the survey.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens were more likely than their White counterparts to report feeling more accepted because of social media, the data showed.\n\nEspecially during the pandemic, the kids Icard worked with were grateful they could still connect with one another, she said. And if encouraged the right way, Icard has seen social media as a good way to showcase talents and humor.\n\nAnd the teens tend to use it that way, the data showed. The top three things teens reported posting about were their accomplishments, family and emotions, according to the survey.\n\nThe survey participants were more likely to say social media is mostly positive or neutral for them personally, but they leaned in more of a negative direction when it came to its impact on people their age, the survey said.\n\n“People might see a lot of benefits from technology and in this case social media,” Anderson said, “but are much more likely to see the downsides when looking at social media as a whole.”\n\nThe negatives\n\nThis survey can be helpful to get an overview of social media and teens, but there are still individual circumstances and downsides to consider, Icard said.\n\nFor example, girls ages 15 to 17 were more likely than any other group to say that they don’t post things on social media because they are worried about being embarrassed, the survey said.\n\nAnd girls more so than boys were likely to report feeling overwhelmed by drama on social media, the study said.\n\nBut all groups acknowledged downsides. Those who reported negative experiences attributed them mostly to screen time, mental health and the impact of online drama, the survey said.\n\nAnd 60% of all teens report feeling little to no control over the data social media companies collect from them.\n\n“Social media is a tool and as such, it’s neither all good nor all bad,” Icard said.\n\n“You know your child’s temperament, social life, and experiences best,” she said via email. “Regardless of how the majority of kids self-report, your decision should take into account your child’s unique situation first.”\n\nHow to optimize the experience\n\nHow do you optimize the experience for yourself or your child then?\n\nIcard recommended a slow exposure, allowing children to join one social media app at a time and only expanding when they demonstrate sufficient responsibility to use them without damage to their sense of self.\n\n“I also think parents should teach their kids app etiquette as well as safety,” Icard said, “and they should monitor more at the beginning but then (taper) off over time.”\n\nHave conversations frequently about what is happening on these platforms. While you can give more autonomy over time, “a child who is unwilling to discuss their experiences on the app might not be ready for one,” she added.\n\nDon’t begin panicking about having a teen on social media, as the experience comes with ups and downs just like any other part of life, Icard said.\n\n“But if parents notice that social media creates feelings that are harmful to their adolescent’s sense of self,” she added, “it would be appropriate to consult with a therapist who can help with more positive self-talk and habits.”", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/health/family-connections-flourish-parenting-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Children are more likely to succeed if they live in this type of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChildren with strong family connections are associated with a high likelihood of flourishing in life, a new study found.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that strong family bonds lower the chances of poor outcomes in children such as risky behaviors and drug abuse, but this study revealed that there may be positive outcomes as well, said lead study author Dr. Robert Whitaker, director of the Columbia-Bassett research program at Columbia University in New York City.\n\n“What was different about this study was it showed that family connection is associated with thriving and not just surviving or avoiding harm,” Whitaker said.\n\nResearchers surveyed over 37,000 children in 26 countries and found adolescents who reported having a great bond with their family also reported that they were succeeding in life.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, included children ages 11 to 13 years old who were surveyed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe data was gathered across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America from the International Survey of Children’s Well-Being, a survey supported by the Jacobs Foundation, a Zurich-based organization that focuses on providing schools around the globe with science-based knowledge to help kids succeed.\n\nFamily connection was determined by a mean score of five categories: care, support, safety, respect, and participation. For each subject, participants were given a statement and asked to assess how much they agreed with it, scoring from zero (do not agree) to 4 (strongly agree). For example, to measure care, children were asked how much they agreed with the statement, “I feel safe at home.”\n\nThe essence of family connection is children feeling that they are accepted and nurtured at home, which allows them to learn what their strengths and weaknesses are in a safe environment as they are building their identity, Whitaker said.\n\nFlourishing was determined by a mean score of six categories: self-acceptance, purpose in life, positive relations with others, personal growth, environmental mastery and autonomy. The survey structure was the same as that for family connections, except the ranking system ranged from zero to 10.\n\nWhen it comes to flourishing, it’s about kids accepting their strengths and weaknesses and then being able to use their strengths to find their purpose in life, he said.\n\nChildren can thrive, not just survive\n\nChildren with the greatest level of family connection were over 49% more likely to flourish compared with those with the lowest level of family connection, according to the study.\n\nIt’s not enough to not have depression and anxiety to live a good life, according to Elaine Reese, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“A good life entails having a sense of purpose and meaning, which is what the flourishing scale in this study measured,” she said.\n\nThe highest scores in both family connection and flourishing came from children who said they live with both parents, have enough food or never have their family worrying about finances.\n\nResearchers then controlled the data for families’ poverty levels, including financial circumstances and food insecurity, to remove the effect they may have had on the numbers. After controlling for these factors, the strength of family connections still impacted how much children flourished.\n\nHow to strengthen family connection\n\nAdults have a very powerful influence on the emotional climate in the home, so it’s important to create a space where children feel seen and heard, Whitaker said.\n\nA great opportunity to strengthen family bonds is around the dinner table, he said. Adults should create an environment where children feel comfortable speaking freely. While they are talking, grown-ups should show that they have a genuine interest in what their children are saying and try to suspend judgment, Whitaker added.\n\nAdults do not need to make grand gestures to bond with their children, Reese said. Having meaningful conversations is more important for your connection than taking them on expensive trips, she said.\n\nSilence is also another powerful form of communication, he said.\n\nChildren and parents or their caregivers spending time together in silence or even running an errand or doing chores can create a connection, according to Whitaker.\n\n“We don’t necessarily need to fill those moments with chatter or the radio,” he said.\n\nOther adults may impact how children flourish\n\nIn the future, Whitaker said he wants to research the impact community members like teachers have on children.\n\n“We suspect that sense of connection to non-parental adults probably adds to the likelihood that teen will flourish,” he said in an email.\n\nOutside relationships are important and do impact children, especially during infancy and early childhood, said Kelly-Ann Allen, an educational and developmental psychologist and senior lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She was not involved in the study.\n\n“If children experience healthy trusting relationships early, they are more likely to establish healthy trusting relationships as adults,” she said.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/homemade-baby-food-toxic-metals-wellness/index.html", "title": "Homemade baby food contains as many toxic metals as store ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMaking baby food at home with store-bought produce isn’t going to reduce the amount of toxic heavy metals in the food your baby eats, according to a new report released exclusively to CNN.\n\n“We found no evidence to suggest that homemade baby foods made from store-bought produce are better than store-bought baby foods when it comes to heavy metal contamination,” said the paper’s coauthor Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures. An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors, HBBF, which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States – including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are among the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also pored over data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared at home. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourth of the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion, according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used in homemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregivers can help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and instead choosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human body doesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregivers need to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/06/11/disabled-not-special-needs-experts-explain-why-never-use-term/7591024002/", "title": "Disabled not 'special needs': Experts explain why we shouldn't say it", "text": "In our daily lives, we may encounter phrases like \"I am disabled\" or \"My child has special needs.\" And to someone who is not part of the community, this wording may seem synonymous.

More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

And everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game. Its game tokens included emojis and a hashtag. Courtesy Hasbro\n\n“It’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one,” he says, “which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years.”\n\nNot to mention that millennials have faced a far bleaker financial picture than older generations, Kimbrough says.\n\n“It’s really hard to think about getting married, having kids, moving out with roommates, and making any of these transitions with the housing market like we have now,” Kimbrough says.\n\nMy husband and I are trying not to be too overwhelmed by this daunting reality.\n\nWe’re visiting open houses on most weekends and planning to meet with mortgage brokers soon.\n\nBy this time next year, we hope we’ll be living in a home that we own.\n\nMyth 4: We don’t take our jobs seriously and don’t stay in them very long\n\nJason Dorsey tells me he often asks a question when he’s invited to visit companies and speak with their employees: “How many of you are millennials?”\n\nGenerally, he says, just a few hands timidly go up.\n\n“They’re expecting it to be negative, because that’s unfortunately what we’ve been framed as for the last 15 years,” Dorsey says.\n\nThat’s around when Dorsey says he saw anti-millennial hype intensifying. Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting. And as this year so painfully reminded me, we never know how much time we’ll have with the ones we love.\n\nWith all this uncertainty, there is one thing I know: My daughter and I are so lucky to be together right now, sharing an evening in a bookstore – something I did with my parents, and something I’d always dreamed of doing if I ever had a child of my own.\n\nAs I watch her toddle down the aisles of the store, I feel so proud of how happy and curious she seems to be.\n\nHer generation doesn’t even have a name yet – or at least not one we know will stick. No matter what we call them someday, I can’t wait to see what they do.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

For the first time since March, the national average price for regular gasoline dropped below $4 a gallon today, according to AAA. This comes after gas prices hit a record high of $5.02 in June, largely due to soaring global oil prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The steady decline in gas prices has been driven by multiple factors, including recession fears that have knocked down oil prices and the fact that some people cut back on driving when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon. Despite the decrease, gas prices still remain 25% higher than this time last year.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nChildren younger than 5 in the US could soon begin receiving Covid-19 vaccinations. Pfizer and BioNTech are requesting emergency use authorization for their two-dose Covid-19 vaccine for children age 6 months up to 5 years. The companies are aiming to complete their submission process within the coming days, which will then be reviewed by the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee on February 15. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is already authorized for use in people as young as 5, and the approval would be the first Covid-19 vaccine available for the youngest children. Since the start of the pandemic, at least 11.4 million children have tested positive for Covid-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported Monday, with over 3.5 million cases reported in January alone.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/sleep-apnea-snoring-danger-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to know if your snoring is bad or dangerous (and what to do ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nObstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time.\n\nSnoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea — but at some point in our lives, we all snore. A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles — and before we know it, we’re unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore.\n\n“Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. “When it’s loud, raucous snoring, or it’s interrupted by pauses in breathing, that’s where we start to get concerned.”\n\nIt’s estimated that at least 25 million American adults and 936 million adults between the ages of 30 and 69 worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed.\n\n‘It can be very, very scary’\n\nIt’s called “obstructive” sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea – in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe – obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues.\n\n“You’re making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can’t. Often you aren’t aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nIf left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes or depression, even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\nHow can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG.\n\nS stands for snoring\n\nSnoring is a key indicator, so it’s a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no pitiful, whimpy snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call “cute.”\n\nIf your partner's snores can be heard though a closed door, it's time to see a sleep specialist. Adobe Stock\n\n“We’re talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,” Dasgupta said.\n\nT stands for tired\n\nBeing really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea.\n\n“Falling asleep anytime you have a moment – sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater – those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.\n\nO stands for ‘observed’\n\nMany people – if not most – have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night – unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking.\n\n“The O stands for observed apnea, and that’s actually worse than just snoring,” Dasgupta said. “An apnea means no flow of air – no air coming in no air going out. You’re not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag.”\n\nBed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,” Robbins said.\n\nP stands for pressure – high blood pressure\n\nObstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body’s sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time.\n\nWhile having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea, but they also lower blood pressure.\n\nB stands for BMI\n\nBody mass index is a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 – and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese.\n\nPeople who are obese or extremely obese – with a BMI of 35 and above – are frequently found to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring.\n\n“Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,” Robbins said.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn’t seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added.\n\nA is for age\n\nMuscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being over age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be – or turn into – obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nThere is some good news: Studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages.\n\nHaving a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n“Now you don’t want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one’s neck build at night,” Dasgupta said. “The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea.”\n\nAre you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more “belly fat,” which can make breathing in general more difficult.\n\n“However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,” Dasgupta said.\n\nHigh-risk needs evaluation\n\nNow it’s time to score your risk. Give yourself a point for every “yes” answer. If you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.\n\nGive yourself a point for every “yes” answer to these questions: Do you snore? Are you tired during the day? Does your partner witness you snoring? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you overweight? Are you older? Do you have a larger neck circumference? Are you a man?\n\nIf you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.\n\n“Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,” Dasgupta said. “You don’t have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice.”\n\nBut don’t ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: “Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention.”\n\nIf your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn’t likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said.\n\n“It’s always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it’s worthwhile getting evaluated,” he said. “If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can’t fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it’s not always about yourself.”\n\nTreatments\n\nThe treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night.\n\nWeight loss can significantly decrease – or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward.\n\nIf anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended.\n\nMild cases of sleep apnea may respond to “positional therapy,” a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring.\n\n“I’m a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,” Dasgupta said.\n\n“You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,” Robbins suggested.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}]}

His Red Bull teammate, Sergio Pérez, finished eighth, which meant the Singapore race was also the first time neither Red Bull driver finished on the podium in 2023.\n\nVerstappen still holds a 151-point lead for the Drivers' Championship over the second-closest driver, his teammate, Pérez. Red Bull (597) also has more than double the points of the next team, Mercedes (289), in the Constructors' Championship.\n\nVerstappen:Reigning champion breaks Formula 1 consecutive wins record with Italian Grand Prix victory\n\nMax Verstappen win streak\n\nVerstappen had just broken Sebastian Vettel's record for longest win streak in Formula 1 history when he won his 10th straight race in the Italian Grand Prix Sept. 3. Vettel, a four-time World Drivers' Champion who retired in 2022, initially set the record in 2013.\n\nThe Dutch driver's fifth place finish also meant an end to his streak of 15 straight podiums. That streak matched two-time champion (and current Aston Martin driver) Fernando Alonso's 2005-2006 run for the third-longest podium streak ever.\n\nFormula One legend Michael Schumacher still holds the longest podium streak with 19 straight between 2001 and 2002. Hamilton has the edge over Alonso and Verstappen with his streak of 16 over 2014-2015.\n\nVerstappen also set the record for race wins in a single season last year, winning 15 of them en route to his second straight Drivers' Championship.\n\nCarlos Sainz career wins\n\nSingapore marks the second race win of the Spanish driver's career and his second straight podium finish.\n\nHis first Formula One win came at Silverstone in the 2022 British Grand Prix. Both of Sainz's wins have come since he joined Ferrari in 2021.\n\nFormula 1:Ex-driver Felipe Massa claims he is ‘rightful’ 2008 champion not Lewis Hamilton", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/motorsport/max-verstappen-saudi-arabia-grand-prix-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Max Verstappen claims first win of F1 season after enthralling battle ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nReigning world champion Max Verstappen won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Sunday after a thrilling battle with Charles LeClerc.\n\nThe Red Bull driver, second for most of the race, took the lead with just a few laps to go and never relinquished it.\n\nJust like in Bahrain last week, the pair were locked together in an enthralling battle, with the final 10 laps of the race in Jeddah making for gripping watching.\n\nThe victory is Verstappen’s first of the 2022 season, having not finished in Bahrain last week.\n\nFerrari made up the rest of the podium with LeClerc in second and Carlos Sainz in third.\n\nThe race came on a difficult weekend for F1, after missile strikes on an oil storage facility near the track by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.\n\n24-year-old Verstappen called it a “really tough race but a good race.”\n\n“We were both battling hard at the front. We just tried to play the long game,” Verstappen said.\n\n“They were really quick through corners and we were really quick on the straight. The tires were wearing out quite quick. You could see by the end we had a little bit more pace.\n\n“I tried to get by, it wasn’t easy, they were playing smart tricks in the last corner, but eventually I managed to get ahead. Even after that he was constantly in the DRS.\n\n“Really happy we finally kick-started the season.”\n\nVerstappen celebrates on the podium after winning the Saudi GP. Clive Mason/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nTo and fro\n\nHaving earned his country’s first-ever pole position, Sergio Perez made a perfect start on Sunday. The Mexican was quick off the line, blocking off second-placed LeClerc as well as maintaining his lead.\n\nHowever, his dream race soon began to unravel.\n\nAn apparent fake pit from Ferrari meant Red Bull chose to pit Perez – losing places – just moments before Nicholas Latifi crashed, causing a safety car to come out which allowed other drivers to pit themselves.\n\nIt meant when the safety car left the track, LeClerc lead, followed by Verstappen with Perez down in fourth after giving up his third spot for a pit lane violation.\n\nAnd with no obstructions ahead of him, the Monegasque driver continued his excellent pace in 2022, having won the opening race of the season in Bahrain last weekend.\n\nThe 24-year-old managed to hold off a flying Verstappen until a virtual safety car was called into place in the 38th lap after two cars both lost drive near the pit lane.\n\nAfter the second safety car of the race was stopped, just like in Bahrain last week, the two young stars did battle once again.\n\nThey went back and forth, with Verstappen getting his nose in front, only for LeClerc to come roaring back.\n\nVerstappen drives in front of LeClerc. Peter Fox/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nBut with just over three laps to go, the Dutch driver took the lead yet again and held on with a vice-like grip to claim his first victory of the season.\n\nBoth Verstappen and LeClerc have expressed their respect for one another before, and they could be seen embracing after their thrilling race.\n\nAnd despite a disappointing finish in Jeddah for LeClerc, he said that “every race should be like this.”\n\n“It was not enough today. I really enjoyed that race, it was hard racing but fair! Every race should be like this. It was fun, I wanted to win today,” he said.\n\n“We had two very different configurations with the Red Bulls. We were quite quick in the corner, but slow in straights. It was extremely difficult for me to cover Max in the straight. Max did a great job, it was a fun race.”\n\nVerstappen and Leclerc embrace after the Saudi GP.

Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff told reporters teams had been “assured that we are protected” and the track was “probably the safest place that you can be in Saudi Arabia” at the moment.\n\nHowever, sources told CNN drivers felt uneasy after the attack and many did not want to drive in the race.\n\nThe Houthis said they used a “large number” of drones to target the facility in Friday’s attack.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said one ballistic missile and 10 bomb-laden drones launched from the southern border by the Iran-backed rebels were intercepted, according to Saudi state-run TV channel al-Ekhbariya.

The rapper, who has bipolar disorder, is known to go on public rants, be it about his ex-wife Kim Kardashian dating Pete Davidson, saying slavery \"sounds like a choice\" or falsely claiming that George Floyd died from fentanyl rather than \"cardiopulmonary arrest,\" complicated by \"restraint and neck compression\" while he was being subdued by police, as the Hennepin County medical examiner's office ruled in June 2020.\n\nThe rapper was locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts due to statements he made earlier this month. Spokespeople for Twitter and Instagram said Ye posted messages that violated their policies. His comments have been widely condemned by experts as antisemitic: American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch last week dubbed Ye's words “a clear and present danger to every Jewish person.”\n\nYe flip-flopped his stance on his previous comments in his recent interviews, at one point defending his \"death con 3\" tweet to Cuomo (“It's like a modern-day slavery, and I'm calling it out. It didn't mean I wish any harm on my fellow Jewish people”).\n\nHe later told Morgan in an interview set to air in full on Friday that he does not regret his antisemitic remarks. “I fought fire with fire,” said Ye, acknowledging the “racist” nature of his comments.\n\nBut Ye also told the British talk-show host that he apologizes for the “hurt and confusion” caused by his tweet. “Hurt people hurt people, and I was hurt,” he said.\n\n'Because they do':Ye tells Tucker Carlson why he wore 'White Lives Matter' sweatshirt\n\nYe's antisemitic remarks garner public backlash from celebrities, experts\n\nActors Jamie Lee Curtis and Sarah Silverman, both of whom are Jewish, also used their platform to speak out against the hateful messages shared by Ye.\n\nCurtis, 63, responded on Twitter: \"The holiest day in Judaism was last week. Words matter. A threat to Jewish people ended once in a genocide. Your words hurt and incite violence. You are a father. Please stop.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Silverman, 51, questioned why Ye's tweet didn't get bigger traction. \"Kanye threatened the Jews yesterday on twitter and it’s not even trending,\" she wrote. \"Why do mostly only Jews speak up against Jewish hate? The silence is so loud.\"\n\nMore in Hollywood have since spoken out: \"Weird how all these 'free, independent thinkers' always land at the same old anti blackness and anti semitism,\" John Legend tweeted. Comedian D.L. Hughey told Cuomo that Ye has \"made a great living co-opting the pain of Black people\" and \"sounds a lot like a white supremacist.\" Kerry Washington commended HBO's sports talk show \"The Shop,\" which stars LeBron James and Maverick Carter, for announcing it would not air a recently-taped interview with the rapper, which Carter told Andscape was used to \"reiterate more hate speech and extremely dangerous stereotypes.\"\n\nYe locked out of social mediafor antisemitism; Jamie Lee Curtis, Sarah Silverman, more react\n\nSeveral leaders from Jewish advocacy organizations have also spoken out against Ye's comments, which they argue spread harmful stereotypes and have been \"embraced by antisemitic extremist groups,\" as the Anti-Defamation League wrote.\n\n\"With his vile online comments, West effectively encouraged hatred against Jews at a time when antisemitism and other hate crimes have risen to alarming levels around the world,\" Deutch said in a statement issued on Oct. 12. \"This cannot be countenanced. West has acknowledged he suffers from bipolar disorder, but mental illness is no excuse for antisemitism. Let’s hope he gets the help he desperately needs. Until then, Twitter, Instagram should follow their own guidelines prohibiting hate speech and keep West’s anti-Jewish hate off their channels.”\n\nA record number of antisemitic incidents were recorded across the United States in 2021, according to a study released earlier this year from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group that has been tallying attacks on the Jewish community since 1979. The 2,717 incidents were a 34% increase from 2020 and included rising cases of harassment, assaults and antisemitic vandalism.\n\nAn Oct. 14 statement from the ADL added: \"Ye also invoked the antisemitic belief that Jewish people are disproportionately powerful and that they control the media, including the music industry. This trope has been present in the discourse of other Black performers and activists in the past and is a common talking point within more extremist groups.\"\n\nThe Black Jewish Entertainment Alliance tweeted condemning Ye: “The Black and Jewish communities must stand together through incidents like this to make clear that trafficking in hateful stereotypes is unacceptable & that the words of one entertainer do not reflect the views of an entire community.”\n\nNo, Ye's mental health does notexcuse antisemitism, experts say\n\nHow does Ye's 'White Lives Matter' sweatshirt controversy play into this?\n\nYe claimed the “Jewish media” has been hostile in their coverage of him after he was criticized for wearing a black sweatshirt with the phrase \"WHITE LIVES MATTER\" written across the back.\n\n“When I wore the White Lives Matter t-shirt, the Jewish underground media mafia already started attacking me,” Ye said. “They canceled my four So-Fi Stadium shows. They had the press, back when I was arguing with Pete Davidson and Trevor Noah, they called me an abuser for arguing with people about my ex-wife and my family and when I get to see my kids.”\n\nHis sweatshirts were met with backlash from many in the fashion community, including British Vogue Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful, model Gigi Hadid and Vogue global fashion editor-at-large Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who called the sweatshirts \"deeply offensive, violent and dangerous.\"\n\nMother of George Floyd's daughterplans to file lawsuit against Ye\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/05/02/high-fashion-has-inclusivity-problem-designers-legacy/7369209001/", "title": "The Met Gala's exclusivity is outdated.

But because of the industry's interest in selling an aspirational, unattainable fantasy, it may never be able to change until cultural standards of beauty steer away from thin and white or until new diverse talent is embraced.\n\nLast year, the gala took two steps forward by inviting beauty influencer Jackie Aina, who was the first Black content creator ever to attend Met Gala, and YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, who paid homage to LGBTQ activist Marsha P. Johnson with her gown. But the same event also took one step back as it ignored a handful of Black designers.\n\nFormula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton publicly corrected the invite list of the 2021 gala by paying for tickets of three Black designers — Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson and Jason Rembert — to attend their industry's magnum opus event.\n\n\"These designers,\" Lewis wrote on Instagram, \"Deserve this moment just as much as any other designer who attends the Met Gala.\"\n\nFashion designer Tracy Reese, who serves on the Council of Fashion Designers of America's board of directors and has been in the industry for more than 30 years, says minority designers like herself were \"discouraged\" from thinking they'd ever attend the gala in the past.\n\n\"We see more color on the red carpet. But in terms of industry representation, for designers of color that's been very limited,\" Reese says.\n\nWhile young minority designers have been overlooked, the gala's legacy designers are ever-present, even after facing diversity and inclusion faux pas within their operations.\n\nMet Gala designers' history of missteps\n\nBalenciaga, the designer behind Kim Kardashian's incognito Met Gala look, was called out for cultural appropriation in 2021 after releasing their boxer-peeking sweatpants, retailing $1,190 for a style made popular by hip-hop culture and historically denounced and considered lesser by legacy fashion.\n\nSupermodel Iman turned heads in her Dolce and Gabbana (designed by Harris Reed) gown at last year's Met Gala. But just months before, the fashion house was suing fashion bloggers who reposted anti-Asian comments allegedly attributed to one of the label's designers.\n\nPrada and Gucci each had their time under the sun of call-outs after launching designs that stirred blackface controversies.\n\nRacism in fashion:From Gucci to Prada, luxury fashion brands challenged to confront racist attitudes\n\n\"Social media has played a role,\" says Aina of the recent backlash fashion houses have faced. \"You can't really ignore a lack of diversity anymore – people will absolutely make noise, will absolutely call you out and it just makes it so that it's harder to sweep things under the rug.\"\n\nKaren says \"the old guard\" of executives is keeping the fashion's exclusive standard in place and until there's new talent, \"these things (will) still continue.\"\n\nMore:Director Spike Lee boycotts Gucci, Prada brands over blackface fashion\n\nThe needle on fashion inclusion started to nudge forward as Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 made industries rethink their practices, but the rethinking came \"way too late\" says longtime business of culture journalist Christina Binkley.\n\n\"If it takes a massive scandal and your brand being nearly canceled to start thinking about the importance of diversity and inclusion, then you're way, way, way too late,\" Binkley says.\n\nWhen luxury fashion lined up social media posts to show solidarity with Black Lives Matters protests in 2020, more blowback followed.\n\nTransgender model and actress Munroe Bergdorf jumped on L’Oreal’s #BlackoutTuesday posts to accuse the beauty brand of hypocrisy for having fired her when she complained about racism. U.S. trans actress Tommy Dorfman, who once appeared in a campaign for Salvatore Ferragamo, called out the Italian luxury brand for what she called a \"homophobic and racist work environment.”\n\n\"I think that it absolutely feels out of date, and unfashionable and uninteresting for there not to be diversity,\" Reese says. \"I think those walls are breaking down and not just in terms of color, it's also in terms of size, and deciding what is and isn't beautiful.\"\n\nHave brands with inclusion scandals improved?\n\nAfter facing negative feedback over the past few years, many fashion brands have ushered in diversity councils and inclusion initiatives.\n\nL'Oreal rehired Bergdorf after her callout; however in a statement to WWD, Salvatore Ferragamo said they were surprised by Dorfman's comments and added that there's \"no evidence\" of her critique of the label's work environment.\n\nBinkley says sometimes many European brands can be farther removed from understanding racism in America and have had a harder time reacting to pushes for diversity.\n\n\"Somebody who grew up in (Italy, might not) grasp what the civil rights movement in America meant, what slavery for Americans meant – on the one hand, they really need to because America is a big market and they're marketing to America,\" Binkley says.\n\nAt New York Fashion Week in February, nonprofit organization Color of Change teamed up with The Black in Fashion Council, IMG, and model Joan Smalls to introduce an inclusion rider for the fashion industry to lay out guidelines to steer fashion's post-reckoning promises \"from rhetoric to action.\"\n\nSmall bits of action have been seen with diverse creative director hires including Rhuigi Villaseñor for Bally and June Ambrose for Puma. Major fashion publications have more diverse leadership with Edward Enninful at the top of British Vogue's masthead and Samira Nasr leading Harper's Bazaar. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\n\"It's important that we're talking about everything from size, color, gender, you name it,\" Reese says. \"We've got so much ground to make up for.\"\n\nAccording to CFDA and PVH's 2021 State of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Fashion report, fewer Black fashion industry employees (57%) believed their company was doing enough when it came to racial and gender inclusivity compared to white counterparts (77%) and less than half of Black respondents who agreed (44%) believed these measures would result in permanent change.\n\nBudding designers are key fashion's inclusive future\n\nTo be fashionable goes hand-in-hand with being forward-thinking. Established labels could benefit from calling on budding designers, and up-and-coming designers could benefit from legacy label recognition.\n\nKaren says the gap between new designers and major fashion houses is because the latter is often \"high on the perch\" and unable to see what's coming through the ground level.\n\n\"Those opportunities have to be created for gatekeepers and newcomers to even converse,\" Reese says. \"What's been good to see is how many up and coming designers of color are being selected for things like (CDFA and Vogue's) fashion fund or Woolmark prize.\"\n\nMoments of exposure, like the Met Gala, are key in bringing new culture to fashion through young talent.\n\n\"It's easier to incorporate that ethos of diversity and inclusion if you're starting new, rather than trying to guide a huge ship in a new direction,\" Karen says.\n\nWhile the world waits to see their favorite celeb on the carpet, the industry could benefit on taking note of who they left out.\n\nWhite men still run the fashion industry:Report shows there's a long road ahead toward inclusion\n\nReese says its \"necessary\" for us to include new voices in fashion, if the industry doesn't it will come complacent and irrelevant like last season's wardrobe.\n\nShe adds: \"We get lazy and go for what's easy. And we stop exploring. We stop being curious. And that's really unfashionable, isn't it?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/11/28/virgil-abloh-dies-louis-vuitton-off-white-designer-mourned-celebs/8787333002/", "title": "Virgil Abloh mourned by Kanye West, Kardashians, Hailey Bieber, BTS", "text": "The fashion world is paying tribute to Virgil Abloh, the trailblazing Louis Vuitton director who died Sunday at age 41.\n\nAbloh, the artistic director for Louis Vuitton menswear and founder and CEO of fashion house Off-White, died after a private battle with a \"rare, aggressive form of cancer,\" according to social media posts from the brands.\n\nHe was a pioneer in the fashion world, serving as the first Black artistic director to lead Louis Vuitton menswear.

Facebook (FB) recently changed its name to Meta Platforms. Nike (NKE) bought a virtual shoe company to help it expand to the metaverse. And other brands like Gucci and Ralph Lauren have been considering the future of fashion with digital personas.\n\nWith all the attention, it can be difficult for general news consumers to parse through what is a marketing gimmick versus what really matters. It requires journalists to approach the tech industry’s new favorite buzzword with an open mind and with nuance, something that the media hasn’t always been consistent with in years past, according to Gideon Lichfield, global editorial director of Wired.\n\n“Every time the industry goes after a new name for something and tries to pivot, something new inevitably comes out of it. It’s just not clear yet what it will be,” Lichfield said. “I think one has to be really critical of this tendency and call out what is just marketing and hype, which is a large part of it, whilst remaining open-minded to the fact that something new does emerge.”\n\nAt Wired, Lichfield oversees how the preeminent tech magazine covers these topics and other new tech trends for its website and print magazine. The latest print issue, featuring actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II on the cover, focuses on the future of reality.\n\nLichfield spoke with CNN Business about how tech journalism’s evolution, diversity in media and his predictions of next year’s biggest tech stories.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nYou wrote in a recent editor’s letter that the tech industry is at “an inflection point.” What exactly do you mean by that, and where does the media fall into that turn of events?\n\nGideon Lichfield Christopher Michel\n\nI think we went from this period of a lot of hype about tech utopianism in the 90s, which is when Wired was created, then all the way over to the techlash of the 2010s and the tech industry became the big demon. I think the media coverage of the tech industry, which was focusing on the very real problems around tech has contributed to that. One of the things I saw coming out of the pandemic was what seemed like a surge of sentiment in the other direction.\n\nI feel like it’s helpful for us to just try to get out of this swinging back and forth between tech is great, tech is bad, tech is great.\n\nThe tech press is in the middle of covering two massive scandals right now: The Facebook Papers and the Congressional hearings about Facebook, and then there’s the Elizabeth Holmes’ trial. How do you see these two events being covered? What is the press getting right? What could they improve on?\n\nThat’s an interesting one. I think I actually can talk more about the Facebook one. I don’t think I’ve followed the coverage of the Elizabeth Holmes trial as closely.\n\nThat’s okay. I just think with what you said [the Holmes trial] is a good example of someone who was lauded and changing the world and now she’s on trial.\n\nWhat I can say about Elizabeth Holmes is I think that probably the early coverage of her — not talking about what’s happening now — there was probably a bit of this tendency, which Wired has been guilty of too in the past, of going, “Oh, wow, here’s this person doing this amazing thing, and it could be totally transformative.” And either not being able to or not wanting to look a little harder and say, “Well, you know, just how likely is it that this will succeed?” And I think there’s a certain style of tech coverage which has been this thing is really cool. It could be amazing, and we’re going to completely suspend judgment on how plausible it actually is. I think it behooves us to have that critical lens.\n\nOn Facebook, the thing that has struck me about it is we all, and Wired included, did a lot of coverage of the Facebook Papers and what came out of them. And that’s important, and I think that it probably drives the conversation on Capitol Hill, which ultimately is where this matters. That’s where the regulation is going to come out of. But part of me asked: How much does this actually talk to the general public? How much of this stuff are they reading? There was almost too much detail, too many revelations, too many little things. And as with other things in the past like the financial crisis or the health care reform, I think the public can get a certain amount of fatigue. There’s all this detail, but what am I actually supposed to just think about this?\n\nI recently read a tweet from Sara M. Watson, a principal analyst at Forrester, who wrote, “[T]he media cycle shift toward crypto, web3, metaverse etc. increasingly feels like tech has architected a successful pivot to redirect attention on to the next thing, rather than dealing with what they’ve already built and broken.” Do you agree with that sentiment?\n\nWhen people are talking about the metaverse, they’re appropriating a term from this novel that imagines the metaverse as a certain kind of thing and they’re trying to bring the idealism or that idea to a very different and very disparate set of experiences. Web3 similarly feels like an attempt to put a new, easy to understand catchy label on a bunch of stuff that is happening. And that was true Web2 as well, and yet, in hindsight, you can say that having that label helped coalesce or crystallize some shifts that were happening on the web and on the internet in industry in general. That did mark a real trend, mark some changes. So here again, I’m trying to inject nuance. I’m saying yes, I agree. It’s marketing. It’s relabeling. The same problems exist, and the same problems that we have on social media spaces today will carry over into virtual spaces and metaverse spaces. And so one should approach it with a great deal of caution and at the same time open to the question: What new stuff might emerge?\n\nSo good writing to you is making information easy to distill and nuance and also being very clear to the public?\n\nNuance and clarity and not flooding people with stuff.\n\nThe media and the tech industries have both suffered from a lack of diversity. The top leadership at Wired — you, the global editorial director, and your deputy Greg Williams — are white men. What effect do you think that has on your coverage?\n\nI don’t know what effect directly it has on the coverage because the stories that we do on a day-to-day basis are being generated from all across the newsroom and at all levels. It’s not like me and Greg are sitting there handing down assignments.\n\nWhat I do think it means though is that we have to absolutely make an even greater effort than we would otherwise to make sure that we’re recruiting as diversely as possible and continuing to fill the ranks so that the next generation of Wired leadership can be not white men. And also so that everybody in the newsroom does feel like they can work in an environment where there are no biases, there are no assumptions, there are no things that are affecting the work or leading to exclusionary decisions and making sure that whenever there are important decisions to be taken that there are people in the room who are a mix.\n\nDo you keep an ongoing diversity report on your newsroom?\n\nWired was doing this before I arrived. We’ve done a staff diversity audit, and we’ve a couple of times taken a month and done a contributor diversity audit. And we’ve talked about doing the source diversity audit as well. That’s more intensive, but that’s something that we want to keep on doing periodically and just try to keep track of who’s writing for us.\n\nAre there any platforms that you want to grow for Wired?\n\nThere’s no one particular platform where I can tell you, “Yeah, this is somewhere that we’re going to be.” But I just want to have from the ground up honest conversation about let’s say TikTok. What would it mean to be authentically Wired on TikTok, not to be a cringey form of Wired, right? Not to do something because it’s cool or just because it’s an audience grab but because we think this is a genuine way to express what Wired is about.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest tech stories of 2022? How would you say that the media industry, Wired included, should be covering these stories?\n\nI think the crypto and NFT boom is going to continue to be a big one, and the way I want us to cover that is to try to, again, nuance. Sort the wheat from the chaff, sort the reality from the hype, but at least try to forge a path between these really polar opposites of discourse about the industry, which it’s either it’s all a scam or it’s going to completely change the world. There’s something in there that I don’t know what it is yet that is going to emerge. I’ve not yet seen a long-term application of crypto that really convinces me that is transformative. But that doesn’t mean that’s not there, and I want us to keep looking for it.\n\nI think that the metaverse conversation will continue and at this point it feels to me it’s almost like a terminological land grab. In other words, people are fighting for the definition of what the metaverse is. I don’t think we’re going to get the answer to that, at least not in the next year. But I think we should continue to cover the companies that are claiming to be building the metaverse and asking the serious questions about what are you actually building and how is it different? And continue to ask the same questions we were asking before which is how is it going to be safe for people? Who’s benefiting from it?\n\nThe cover of Wired's December issue Thompson Samuel Ekong/WIRED\n\nI think the regulation of Facebook and tech regulation more broadly story in the US is going to continue to be really interesting. I don’t know whether it’s going to get out of partisan deadlock. And there will be some sort of breakthrough before the midterm elections or whether it will just stay stuck there, but I think that’ll really be interesting to watch.\n\nSimilarly, by contrast, the regulatory efforts that are going on in Europe. There’s actually more happening on tech regulation in Europe and has been for a while than there is in the US and to some extent that’s starting to set the agenda, I think, for US companies, and I think an interesting thing to watch.\n\nThe China-US rivalry over technology and in general, whether it’s on AI supremacy or export controls, trade barriers, intellectual property that I think is going to continue holding up and we have to keep covering that really closely.\n\nWhat if anything gets implemented from COP26, very important climate story.\n\nThe continuing aftermath for the pandemic, both in terms of health, obviously, and how we manage the pandemic and whether or not we get vaccines to the places that need them, but also the continuing readjustment in work, how people work, the relation between employers and employees, the economic impact of people moving to different places, migrating, working remotely.", "authors": ["Kerry Flynn"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/media/954539/chris-mason-who-is-the-bbcs-new-political-editor", "title": "Chris Mason: who is the BBC's new political editor? | The Week", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

He has spent the two decades since at the BBC, working on its regional desk at Westminster and as a political reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live. In 2012 he became a political correspondent for BBC News, covering British politics on national TV over the course of a decade during which he “developed his distinctive ‘earnest yet informal’ style in front of the camera”, said politics.co.uk.\n\nHe shot to prominence in 2017 as the presenter of the popular Brexitcast podcast, first with Adam Fleming, and then with Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler.\n\nIn October 2019 Mason became the host of BBC Radio 4‘s Any Questions?, taking over from long-time host Jonathan Dimbleby.\n\nMason lives in southeast London with his wife, who is a primary school teacher, and their two sons.\n\nHow did he get the job?\n\nMason first emerged as favourite for the six-figure-salary job in early April. He is “widely liked across the BBC”, The Guardian said at the time, but did not originally apply as it was seen as a role for a more experienced journalist.\n\nPeople with knowledge of the recruitment process told The Sunday Times that BBC bosses had encouraged him to apply after the “protracted” appointments process “descended into farce” and plans for an all-women shortlist were scrapped.\n\nJonathan Munro, interim director of BBC News, and Katy Searle, its executive editor for politics, had “emphasised during interviews that they wanted a journalist who will produce exclusives”, the paper added. But “Mason is not known for big scoops”.\n\n“They said they wanted someone who breaks stories but I think they’ve realised they actually need a wise statesman who is good at analysing events, and Chris will do brilliantly at that,” a senior political journalist told the paper. “This feels like a moment of self-realisation for the BBC, that they can’t be that bold.”\n\nWhat are his political views?\n\nWhile Mason “is yet to provoke as many (and varying) different claims of bias as his predecessor, his broadcasting career to date has not been shy of controversy”, says politics.co.uk.\n\nThe Independent unearthed a 2000 interview he conducted while still a student with the former chancellor, Norman Lamont, in which he blasted the Lords as a “talking shop for past-it politicians and do-gooders in high places”.\n\n“However, those on the left of the political spectrum have also had their disagreements with Mason,” says politics.co.uk. It cited a December 2021 episode of BBC Breakfast in which Mason was accused of targeting Labour shadow cabinet minister Baroness Chapman, and there was another bias row in 2021 when he intervened to defend former Conservative MP and minister Ann Widdecombe during a live recording of Any Questions?.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\n“Internally, he is seen as the ultimate safe pair of hands – with both the pluses and minuses that entails – for a BBC news operation in transition,” said The Guardian.\n\nHis promotion from a host on Radio 4 to BBC political editor “seems to have taken many people by surprise”, said the Daily Mail, but “the public outpouring of praise appears to have touched the born-and-raised Northerner”.\n\nMason reacted to his appointment to “the most extraordinary job in British broadcasting and journalism” by saying he “clambers upon the shoulders of giants like Laura, Nick Robinson and Andrew Marr with a smattering of trepidation and a shedload of excitement and enthusiasm.\n\n“To lead the best team of journalists in the business on the best news patch of the lot is something I’d never even dared dream of. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nWhat is more, says the Daily Mail, “in this day and age of equality and diversity, Mason’s strong Yorkshire accent will allow BBC bosses to keep Boris Johnson’s prowling Culture Secretary satisfied as the government insists on more regional representation within the corporation’s ranks”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rebekah Evans", "Felicity Capon", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/22"}]}

The response to the attack in which 19 children and two teachers were killed has been denounced as an “abject failure” with enough blame to be spread widely.\n\nThe school police chief was fired and now seven DPS officers are being investigated for what they did – or did not – do. CNN has uncovered exclusively that Elizondo is one of those officers being investigated. A source close to the investigation also confirmed that to CNN.\n\nShe no longer works for DPS. During the summer, she was hired as a police officer for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, where her role is to protect some of the very same children who survived the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nElizondo declined to speak with CNN in person, on the phone or by direct message.\n\nFollowing this CNN report, the school district issued a statement announcing her termination effective Thursday.\n\n“We are deeply distressed by the information that was disclosed yesterday evening concerning one of our recently hired employees, Crimson Elizondo,” the statement from the district said. “We sincerely apologize to the victim’s families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused. Ms. Elizondo’s statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.”\n\n“Regarding the remaining UCISD Police Department employees, we continue to make personnel decisions based on verifiable information. An independent investigation is underway to evaluate the actions of the current officers on May 24, 2022. Additionally, we are awaiting results of a management and organizational review of the UCISD Police Department that will aid the district in taking informed actions to further ensure the safety and security of our schools,” the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Uvalde School District Police were informed as early as July 28 that Elizondo was subject to investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General for actions “inconsistent with training and department requirements,” according to documents obtained by CNN in a public records request.\n\nIt is not clear from the letter which actions were subject to investigation.\n\nParents recognized her\n\nCrimson Elizondo was clearly visible on body camera footage from Uvalde police released by the mayor. Much other footage has not been made public. City of Uvalde\n\nUvalde CISD has said it wanted to recruit 10 more officers after the May 24 attack. It did not specifically announce the hiring of Elizondo over the summer, though the names and photos of her and four other police officers, one lieutenant and one security guard are on its website, under the banner “KEEP U.C.I.S.D. SAFE.”\n\nSuperintendent Hal Harrell told a special town hall meeting in August that at least 33 DPS officers would also be deployed around the district’s eight schools. After initial concern by residents that officers who failed to stop the killing would be tasked with school security, parent Brett Cross told CNN he had been assured the deployed DPS officers would not have been responders to the shooting.\n\nIn her new position, that restriction does not apply to Elizondo. Children and parents walked past her as they headed into the school year at Uvalde Elementary, the new home for the younger students who survived the Robb bloodshed.\n\nAnd some parents, including those who lost children in the massacre, recognized her from the body camera footage released by the mayor, family members told CNN.\n\n“We are disgusted and angry at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s (UCISD) decision to hire Officer Crimson Elizondo. Her hiring puts into question the credibility and thoroughness of UCISD’s HR and vetting practices,” according to a statement from family representatives.\n\nIt made them feel uneasy, CNN has learned, yet another reminder of the deadly day in a town that is full of such reminders.\n\nBut they did not know that she was under investigation.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the school district knew of the investigation when she was hired.\n\nThe statement from family representatives calls for all department officers to be suspended pending a third-party investigation, and its results “must be released” to the public as well as families of the victims.\n\n“Our children have been taken from us. We will not stop fighting until we have answers and we ensure the safety of the children in our community is the top priority,” the statement said.\n\nCross, the legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, one of the children killed at Robb Elementary, says he is “disgusted” by what the district has done.\n\n“I’m absolutely appalled,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper and says the school board met with him and offered to pull such officers to off-campus roles. He says he will continue to hold a vigil outside the school board offices until all officers are suspended.\n\nThe district and its staff have not responded to emails and calls and a personal approach from CNN about this story.\n\nSecret scrutiny\n\nTexas DPS, the state body that helps local law enforcement in major incidents, announced an internal review into its employees who responded to Robb.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN that Elizondo is one of seven officers whose conduct is being investigated by DPS, but neither their names nor their actions or inactions have been made public.\n\nIn a redacted internal memo to the organization’s director obtained by CNN, DPS cited “actions which may be inconsistent with training and requirements” as the reason for the officers being referred for investigation.\n\nSources familiar with the inquiry told CNN that Elizondo was not properly equipped and said to investigators that she was not comfortable going inside the school without her gear.\n\nElizondo was briefly inside the hallway while the attack was ongoing but was not wearing body armor. City of Uvalde\n\nFootage from police body cameras and those of other officers seen by CNN show Elizondo arriving at the outskirts of the school as one of the first officers to respond to the report of an armed man at Robb Elementary.\n\nShe gets out of her official vehicle but does not retrieve any tactical body armor or her long rifle, as officers are trained to do.\n\nShe does not approach the school but stays with officers from other agencies outside the fence until a call comes over the radio, “Shots fired inside the building!”\n\nElizondo runs with other officers to the eastern end of the building that housed connecting classrooms 111 and 112. Soon after, the responding officers are told that the shooter is contained in a room on the west side.\n\nAfter that, there plays out on the recordings the more than one hour of confusion and delay before anyone goes to help the trapped staff and students in rooms 111 and 112, the catalog of errors that has become part of the Uvalde tragedy.\n\nElizondo walked inside the building briefly but mostly stood outside.\n\nAs officers prepared for what became the final breach, she offered to help a colleague and went to gather supplies for him. She was away from the school when the gunman was shot and killed.\n\nWithin moments, the body camera recordings show, the hallway where so many had stood became a scene of carnage as officers got students out of the classrooms and assessed their injuries.\n\nElizondo was soon there, urging students to “go, go, go” if they were able, and not to look at their injuries or the blood on the floor. She comforted one boy as an officer checked his wounds, telling him time and again that she was there with him, that he would be OK and that his parents would soon be told.\n\nThe footage showed she traveled to the hospital in a school bus with students who were shot and traumatized, again helping to take care of them.\n\nDPS director Col. Steven McCraw said in August: “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy.”\n\nTwo weeks later official notes of a meeting showed McCraw telling captains, “No one is losing their jobs.” McCraw told CNN he had been misquoted in the minutes and vowed “no one gets a pass.”\n\nElizondo, on the right in her new UCISD uniform, declined to talk to CNN. CNN\n\nHe said he would release all the information when he could, but the local district attorney has asked him not to do so until the criminal investigations are completed, a process he has acknowledged could take years.\n\nProsecutor Christina Mitchell Busbee will charge anyone who has committed a crime at Robb Elementary, including law enforcement officers, she’s said.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Public Safety, which declined to comment for this story.\n\nA coalition of news organizations including CNN is suing the DPS for records relating to the investigation that have been withheld from the media and public.\n\nSo far, the only person known to have lost their job over the response to the shooting has been school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who was fired by the school board in August. Arredondo became the figurehead of the failed response, though he has said he did not consider himself the incident commander and has called to be reinstated.\n\nElizondo earned a base salary of $59,715 at DPS, according to a database compiled by The Texas Tribune, reflecting a 12% raise a year ago. She joined the department in 2018.\n\nHer new salary is not known, but a job posting for a similar role has a lower salary range, from $41,584 to $59,158.\n\nThat posting lists mental and physical demands of the position, including an “Ability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons … under intense threatening conditions.”\n\nOn May 24, as she rode the school bus back to Robb Elementary from the hospital, she told another officer: “Nothing could prepare you for what they brought out. It was horrible.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Matthew J. Friedman Rachel Clarke", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Matthew J.

CNN has reached out to the deputies and officer.\n\nThe deputies are not rookies and have been in law enforcement “for some time,” while the Mulberry officer has been in policing for “many years” and previously worked for the sheriff’s department, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante told reporters Monday. They are suspended with pay, he said.\n\nThe US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas confirmed it had opened a federal civil rights investigation. The FBI Little Rock field office and the US Justice Department’s civil rights division are also investigating, according to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office.\n\nAnalysts: Use of force seems excessive\n\nThe video, which was posted on social media, shows the officers restraining an individual – identified by state police as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina – near a curb outside a business. One officer throws punches at the person’s face and slams his head to the ground, while another knees the individual in the side and back.\n\nA woman who is not seen on the video says, “Don’t beat him! He needs his medicine!” One officer responds, “Back the f**k up!” while another orders her to get in her car.\n\n“We do not know what would happen if that person would not have been videoing,” said Carrie Jernigan, one of Worcester’s attorneys. “The fight was escalating with those officers and you hear that woman on that video yelling, and whoever that is, I think she could’ve saved his life.”\n\nDamante declined to get into many specifics, emphasizing the case remains under investigation, but said the actions he saw on the video are “not indicative of the Crawford County Sheriff’s Department or any law enforcement agency in this area.”\n\nThe deputies “will be punished for what they did, if they’re found to be in violation of any rights,” the sheriff said.\n\nNone of the officers was wearing a body camera, but the Mulberry officer had a dashboard camera on his squad car, which provided details on how the scuffle began, the sheriff said without elaborating.\n\nRandal Worcester leaves the Crawford County Justice Center in Van Buren, Arkansas, on Monday. Andrew DeMillo/AP\n\nTwo CNN senior law enforcement analysts say, judging solely from the video footage, the use of force appears excessive.\n\nWorcester is charged with second-degree battery, resisting arrest, possessing an instrument of crime, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, terroristic threatening and first- and second-degree assault, Arkansas State Police said.\n\nWorcester allegedly threatened a gas station clerk in a neighboring town, Damante told CNN affiliate KHBS. When he was spotted in Mulberry, Worcester was initially cooperative, but then tried to attack the officers, leading to the confrontation in the video, Damante told the station.\n\nThe suspect told officers he had a weapon, but the sheriff believes Worcester handed it over before the fight ensued, he told reporters Monday.\n\nWorcester suffered multiple abrasions to his face, scrapes on his knees, scratches, a swollen right ear and had his eye gouged during the altercation with the law enforcement officers, attorney David Powell said.\n\n“Lots of things happened to him that should not have happened during this altercation,” Powell said.\n\nWorcester was released on $15,000 bail, Powell said. He had his bicycle with him as attorneys escorted him out of the detention center, and he gave no audible response to a reporter’s question. He will be staying with family, his lawyers said.\n\n‘It doesn’t make sense’\n\nFor two CNN senior law enforcement analysts, there remain questions about what happened before and after the moment caught on video. Yet even if Worcester attacked the officers as alleged, the level of force with which they respond seems excessive, the analysts said.\n\n“Especially the blows to the face and head,” said former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. “At one point in time, you see one of the officers actually lift the head and push it down into the pavement. Obviously, that raises the level of force considerably.” It also heightens the risk of serious injury or death, he said.\n\nRamsey continued, “Certainly the blows to the head at the same time you’re trying to get a person to put their hands behind their back – think about it. It doesn’t make sense. If you’re getting hit in the face, you’re going to lift your hands to try to protect your face.”\n\nRamsey and fellow CNN analyst Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, say it’s difficult to imagine what could necessitate the officers’ violent response.\n\nCrawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante says officers did not wear body cameras. KHBS\n\n“It is important to remember that this video only catches a portion of the interaction between this individual who was arrested and the three officers,” McCabe said. “Importantly, those officers maintain that before the video that he attacked one of them, punched him in the head, pushed him to the ground. So, there was obviously a scuffle here that led to the use of force.\n\n“However, what we see on that video, it is very, very hard to argue that what you’re seeing – the sort of punches and the kneeing him in the back and slamming his head … on the ground. That is not acceptable, normal, standard police use of force under really any circumstances.”\n\nIt’s important to consider there are three officers on a single suspect, McCabe said, and the lawmen do not appear to be using any accepted techniques for handcuffing a suspect.\n\nRather, it appears to be an “incredibly violent assault seemingly on a person on the ground and under the control of three officers,” he said. “I’m finding it impossible to justify what you’re seeing on that video really in any way.”\n\nIf attacked, police have a right to respond with necessary, proportionate and objectively reasonable force, Ramsey said, but the Arkansas officers’ reactions seem neither proportionate nor reasonable. Being attacked “doesn’t give you permission to then use excessive force when taking the individual into custody, period. It just doesn’t,” the former police chief said.\n\nSuspect held on $15,000 bail\n\nThe person who posted the video online said her sister witnessed the altercation outside the Kountry Xpress in Mulberry.\n\n“In reference to the video circulating on social media involving two Crawford County Deputies, we have requested that Arkansas State Police conduct the investigation and the Deputies have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation,” the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\nThe Mulberry police officer is on administrative leave pending the investigation’s outcome, his department said.\n\n“The City of Mulberry and the Mulberry Police Department takes these investigations very seriously and holds all their officers accountable for their actions,” a Mulberry police statement said.\n\nRandal Worcester stands charged with assault, battery and other counts. Crawford County Sheriff's Office\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson found the officers’ actions to be “reprehensible conduct in which a suspect is beat in that fashion,” but said the video shows only a “glimpse” of the encounter.\n\nWithout elaborating, he said Worcester “had a history of concern that was legitimate for the officers” but also said the officers’ response was “not consistent” with their training.\n\n“This is not what our law enforcement community represents. It’s not the proper response, and they will be reviewed and appropriate action taken consistent with” the findings of the investigation, the governor said.\n\nArkansas State Police issued a statement saying its investigation “will be limited to the use of physical force by the deputies and the police officer,” and its findings will be submitted to a local prosecutor who will decide if the use of force was consistent with state law. A spokesperson told CNN the statement was the office’s only comment on the case.", "authors": ["Eliott C. Mclaughlin Andy Rose Hannah Sarisohn", "Eliott C.

She then asked him to let her go and showed him her badge.\n\nO’Connor apologized to the deputy and then gave him her business card. “If you ever need anything, call me. Seriously,” she said.\n\nO’Connor and the deputy thanked each other for their service, and the couple was allowed to leave.\n\nThe mayor admonished O’Connor’s actions in a statement released Monday.\n\n“The Tampa Police Department has a code of conduct that includes high standards for ethical and professional behavior that apply to every member of our police force. As the Chief of Police, you are not only to abide by and enforce those standards but to also lead by example. That clearly did not happen in this case,” Castor said.\n\n“It is unacceptable for any public employee, and especially the city’s top law enforcement leader, to ask for special treatment because of their position.”\n\nO’Connor was sworn in as Tampa’s police chief in March, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported at the time, noting she had served the department for 22 years, rising to the rank of assistant chief before retiring in 2016.\n\nOver that time, O’Connor worked with a police chaplain to implement a post-trauma training and retreat program to help officers cope with symptoms of stress associated with first responder careers, Bay News 9 reported. She also helped launch the Resources in Community Hope House program as a safe-haven in a high-crime neighborhood, the station said.\n\nShe also has served as an instructor for the FBI’s Law Enforcement Executive Development Association, her LinkedIn profile states.\n\nThe mayor on Monday recognized O’Connor’s contributions as police chief, including “reducing violent gun crime, proactively engaging with our community and focusing on officer wellness,” Castor said.\n\n“But these accomplishments pale in comparison to the priority I place on integrity.”\n\nIn a Monday resignation letter, O’Connor wrote she “would never want my personal mistake to stand in the way of the progress I have made in mending relationships between the police department and the community, so for that reason, I am resigning.”\n\nThe mayor expects the national search and hiring process for a new Tampa police chief to take several months, she said.\n\nIn interim chief Bercaw, “we have a thoughtful and highly regarded leader in progressive policing,” Castor said. “I am grateful he can hit the ground running and continue working with our community to keep our city safe.”", "authors": ["Melissa Alonso Devon M.

His death led to scores of policing reforms some now predict will be undermined by a law enforcement approach that largely targets communities of color. Floyd’s fatal police encounter started with a 911 call about a counterfeit $20 bill used to buy a pack of cigarettes.\n\n“A lot of the quality-of-life offenses that communities are complaining about they don’t know who else to call but the cops,” said Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney with The Legal Aid Society’s Cop Accountability Project in New York.\n\n“Our society has been conditioned to call the cops for every single issue when we shouldn’t necessarily be doing that… We throw the cops at everything, which means they are now expected to do more and be more and wear more hats – many of which they are not able to or qualified to do.”\n\n‘You’re not going to just do whatever you want’\n\nNYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell on Wednesday unveiled an initiative to reduce shootings and thefts, as well as quality-of-life offenses such as drinking on the streets, loud parties in public spaces and driving with suspended or revoked licenses.\n\nSewell and Mayor Eric Adams insist the strategy is not a return to a broken windows policy that helped spur another controversial NYPD practice known as stop-and-frisk – which was ruled unconstitutional nearly a decade ago for unlawfully targeting Blacks and Latinos.\n\n“To be clear, this is not a return to ‘Stop, Question, and Frisk’ – nor is it ‘policing for numbers,’ ” Sewell said in a statement. “This enforcement will be responsive to community complaints and concerns.”\n\nJeff Asher, a crime analyst who co-founded Datalytics, which evaluates criminal justice data, said studies have shown more aggressive policing to be ineffective in reducing violent crime.\n\n“We’ve learned that stop and frisk is not the answer, that violence reduction can happen independent of that, and we saw that in New York over many years,” he said. “So as far as … data providing credence that we should have more of those policies, I don’t think there’s any evidence of that.”\n\nThe NYPD said that since 2019, calls about drinking on the street more than doubled to 3,193 from 1,452, while calls about loud parties in public spaces jumped to 9,013 from 3,338.\n\nReports of people with knives in the transit system have increased 139% in the same time period, according to the NYPD. Calls about subway drug sales jumped by 71%.\n\n“You’re not going to walk into Duane Reade and take whatever you want and walk out,” Adams said. “You’re not going to hop over the counter and take codeine and other drugs… You’re not going to drive motorcycles through the streets, pulling people out and assaulting them merely because of a traffic accident. You’re not going to openly inject yourself with drugs. You’re not going to just do whatever you want in the city.”\n\n‘We won’t go back to abusive policing’\n\nWhen major crimes in New York City spiked nearly 60% in February compared to the same month in 2021, Adams announced a plan to combat gun violence, crime and homelessness in the subways. Advocates accused the city of criminalizing homelessness.\n\nCrime in New York reached historic lows over the past three decades before numbers started to go up in 2020 – a trend that has continued over the last two years and mirrors what is happening in big cities around the country.\n\nPart of the mayor’s response was to bring back the NYPD’s controversial anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country. The unit has been rebranded as Neighborhood Safety Teams tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods.\n\nOn Monday, after another weekend plagued by gun violence, Adams announced the deployment of five additional Neighborhood Safety Teams (NST) across the city. They will work with patrol officers in a more proactive role expanding duties beyond 911 calls.\n\nThe first plainclothes teams, the mayor said, were deployed a week earlier and conducted more than 30 arrests in neighborhoods with 80% of the city’s gun violence. Ten of those arrests were for gun possession. The others involved drug sales, suspended or revoked licenses and criminal possession of a knife.\n\nAdams, a former NYPD lieutenant, insisted this week that the NYPD is not resurrecting the broken windows approach but bolstering public safety while ensuring civil liberties.\n\n“We are not going back to the policing that I fought to change,” said Adams, noting that video technology will be used to monitor the behavior of officers.\n\n“We won’t go back to abusive policing,” he added.\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the union representing rank-and-file members of the NYPD, voiced support.\n\n“We will do our part to confront these quality-of-life issues,” Lynch said in a statement. “Our communities have been pleading with us to put an end to the lawlessness.”\n\n‘Association between urban blight and crime’\n\nMiami Beach imposed a midnight spring break curfew after two shootings left five people injured. Courtesy Mitch Novick\n\nOther cities around the country also are dealing with not only the third year of a pandemic but also responding to the deadly crisis of gun violence.\n\nIn Detroit, Police Chief James White this week released a 244-page community safety strategy in response to an increase in violent crime that jumped 13% in 2020 compared to the previous year. In 2021, violent crime increased by just 3%, according to the police department.\n\nThe goal of the plan is to reduce violent crime by 10% in part by focusing on quality-of-life issues such as large, loud gatherings and public consumption of drugs and alcohol. The department will also use body-worn cameras to monitor the interactions of officers with the public.\n\n“There is an association between urban blight and crime, including violent crime,” the document said. “We want to continue reducing violent crime in neighborhoods by closely monitoring vacant lots and abandoned or neglected buildings.”\n\nIn Miami Beach, the city commission voted on Tuesday to impose a curfew during spring break this weekend. Some nighttime alcohol sales were banned. The dramatic move and emergency order came after five people were injured in two shootings on Miami Beach’s iconic Ocean Drive last weekend.\n\n“I’m at my wit’s end trying to figure out how to be able to deal with this crowd, with the numbers that are here, and with what we are encountering during the policing of this particular event,” Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Clements told commissioners at an emergency meeting.\n\nSince the spring break season began in February, nine officers have been injured in some capacity, Clements said.\n\nAsher, the crime analyst, questioned the strategy.\n\n“Instituting a curfew is unlikely to have much of an effect on violence,” he said. “You’re basically removing witnesses, removing people from the streets. If you have a curfew it plausibly could lead to more crime and more shootings because people feel freer to act more brazen. There’s little evidence that something like a curfew is going to have an effect.”\n\n‘We’ve tried this before’\n\nAsher said homicides have risen more than 5% in 99 US cities so far this year – to 1,313 compared to 1,248 during the same period in 2021. But he cautioned against drawing conclusions from the numbers in March, noting that the summer and fall data provide a clearer picture of the national trend.\n\n“It is clear the police can curb violence in the short run or crime in the short run,” said Cornell University criminal justice expert Jamein Cunningham. “But then the question is at what cost? That’s the policy question. I don’t think we have a really good answer.”\n\nCunningham and other experts acknowledge that policing aimed at high-crime areas is effective in the short term. But they warn of high costs from further straining relations with communities of color while ignoring social services and neighborhood programs.\n\nWong, the Legal Aid attorney, said a return of more confrontational practices, particularly in marginalized communities, undermines the reforms and other small gains brought about by the protest movement after Floyd’s death.\n\n“We’re coming off the heels of nationwide protests calling for police accountability for police brutality,” she said.\n\n“Many of those encounters were because of broken windows policing… You never see a police department apply broken windows policing to themselves when it comes to accountability and transparency for their own misconduct. We’ve tried this before.

High-profile shootings by plainclothes officers undermined the legitimacy and perception of both the unit and the notion of plainclothes policing in New York. But Adams, who made public safety a key part of his campaign for mayor and touted his history as an NYPD captain as evidence he’s uniquely suited for tackling crime, said better training and oversight will help the city keep the unit’s troubled lineage in its past.\n\n“In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,” Adams said at a press conference announcing a multi-layered plan for fighting crime that also includes investing in community violence prevention and intervention programs. “These officers will be identifiable as NYPD, they will have body cameras, and they will have enhanced training and oversight.”\n\nNew York City is not unique: Cities across the country have units of plainclothes officers assigned to high-risk policing efforts, and though their assignments vary by city, they’re similar in many ways. They’re usually identifiable, unlike undercovers. They’re typically in unmarked cars and not responsible for answering 911 calls, are assigned hours and locations depending on crime concerns, and their mandate is guns or other felony enforcement. And in other cities, they’re also associated with aggressive policing.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a group of officers, deputies, detectives that I can pull and use to prevent and combat a problem they may be having in a certain area,” said Florida’s Orange County Sheriff John W. Mina, who also served as Chief of the Orlando Police Department.\n\n“Here we just had a series of shootings in an area that has been a challenge for years but we were able to divert resources because they’re not tied to just answering calls. And it works. It works. They make a lot of good cases, a lot of good arrests. Put a lot of bad people away to help solve the issue.”\n\nMayor Eric Adams speaks at the 32nd Precinct at a vigil for the two officers shot last week in Harlem. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPlainclothes officers have a checkered history\n\nCritics are quick to point to a checkered history of plainclothes officers in New York – including the three high-profile deaths of Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell and Eric Garner – and a reputation for aggressive policing and abuse of power.\n\nThe biggest problem with the anti-crime unit was the civilian complaints they racked up, said Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n“You’re going after people who’ve committed violent crimes, and firearms, you’re going to get that reaction because you’re not going to be right every time you jump out of the car,” Giacalone said. “That’s just the cost of doing business … If you’re involved in active policing, you’re going to get (complaints).”\n\nData provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the watchdog agency charged with oversight of the NYPD, show the unit garnered lots of complaints over the years. They had 430 complaints in 2019 and 428 in 2018, though the vast majority of those allegations were not proven, the data shows. Officials with CCRB have also said in the past that plainclothes officers were much harder to identify because they were sometimes not wearing badges or name tags and that would lead to unsubstantiated claims.\n\nCCRB Executive Director Darius Charney, whose agency investigates racial profiling and biased policing allegations, said there must be real oversight for the unit to avoid problems that dogged this unit in the past.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the past, the history shows us that these plainclothes officers were really some of the worst offenders when it came to abusive and discriminatory policing,” Charney said. “And I think a lot of that had to do with not only how they were trained or what incentives they were given, but also there was just really a lack of oversight and accountability for officers who did break the law or violate people’s rights.”\n\nThe casket of New York City police officer Wilbert Mora is carried out of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Wednesday, February 2.

Jeenah Moon/The New York Times/Redux In pictures: NYPD mourns fallen officers Prev Next\n\nCops selected will be ‘best fit for the unit’\n\nAdams’ resurrection of this unit is part of his strategy to combat gun violence, which he announced earlier than planned after three weeks of high-profile incidents that was punctuated by the deadly shooting of two NYPD officers answering a domestic disturbance call last week. In all, five New York City Police officers have been shot in the first three weeks of the year.\n\nThe mayor’s plan calls for the new teams to be deployed to 30 of the city’s 77 precincts and housing units that are responsible for 80% of violence in the city.\n\nThe NYPD is vetting candidates for the teams now, Adams said.\n\n“We’re going to make sure the 400 plus people that are in the pipeline to go into our new unit … that they’re the best fit for the unit,” Adams said.\n\n“We must make sure we don’t continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,” Adams said during a speech, following the shooting of the two officers. “I’m going to get my cops to do their job. I need the rest of the country that are in positions of authority to do their job.”\n\nMina said that when he supervised teams in Orlando, he sought officers who could work with minimal supervision and showed they were productive with self-initiated activity.\n\n“They’ve already put together cases, shown an aptitude for writing search warrants. Finding people with guns. Or recruiting (confidential informants),” he said.\n\nElite team was involved in the death of Diallo\n\nThe NYPD’s anti-crime unit existed for decades, and was staffed and directed at the precinct level, meant to respond to concerns within those boundaries and staffed by police officers familiar with the people and places in the precinct.\n\nPromotion to NYPD’s detective squads typically ran through the anti-crime unit, though that’s not always the case in other cities. Promising or ambitious young officers with a few years working uniformed patrol – or those with older relatives or political connections on the job – would ask into NYPD anti-crime and work there for a couple years before doing 18 months or two years of detective work and earning a detective shield, Giacalone said\n\nOnce NYPD officers were selected for the anti-crime units, they were sent to training and worked their new assignment in plainclothes. They were expected to go after guns and people carrying them (referred to as “the gun police” by some residents), so they carried less equipment on their belts than uniformed officers and weren’t required to wear a uniform because of the expectation of getting into foot chases, Giacalone said.\n\nWhile the NYPD had its precinct-level anti-crime units, the department also staffed a more elite “street crime” unit whose main focus was getting guns. They were also plainclothes and in unmarked cars. In 1999, four officers from that unit fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx home.\n\nDiallo was struck 19 times and was killed. The officers, who were later acquitted of murder charges, said they confused his wallet for a gun. The entire unit was eventually disbanded in response to Diallo’s death, and the work they did became the responsibility of the anti-crime units which long operated at the precinct, borough and city levels.\n\n‘Supervision is a good thing’\n\nThe Bronx vestibule where Amadou Diallo was shot and killed by members of New York City's elite 'street crime' unit. Richard Harbus/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nControversy over the years, including drug and money related corruption scandals, led to changes and tighter supervision within plainclothes units. This happened as views on policing continued to evolve across the country and cities started seeing an influx of drugs, drug money, and street violence and police corruption related to both.\n\nAfter the Diallo shooting, the NYPD’s anti-crime unit’s focus remained on guns and violence. Then, in June 2020, then NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that he disbanded all levels of the anti-crime unit, sending roughly 200 members to the detective bureau and spreading others out to different units.\n\nThe move to disband the unit followed protests, in New York and across the country, over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Other cities, in the wake of protests, reexamined their staffing and the utility of proactive policing. But the move in New York was reversed within about two months, as shootings in New York City spiked following the protests. The teams returned as Public Safety Teams, working unmarked cars but in full uniform, city officials have said.\n\nThe NYPD’s teams were typically composed of three officers and a sergeant working shifts that extend into the evening or overnight. In other parts of policing, in other cities and in patrol, sergeants will typically oversee a larger number of officers, from six to 10. Part of the reason for greater supervision, Giacalone said, was to prevent corruption.\n\nMina, who worked in and supervised a similar unit in the Orlando Police Department and whose department now has a similar unit, said that more supervision in high-risk situations was beneficial for everyone.\n\n“If it’s always wanted people you’re going after, or people known to carry guns, you’re going to want the span of control to be tighter so you can manage and supervise what’s going on,” Mina said. “Making sure you’re safe, the public’s safe, and making sure the bad guy is safe and situations can be peacefully resolved. Supervision is a good thing.”\n\nTwo points of contention – the lack of a uniform and the unmarked vehicles – came to represent, to critics, bad policing and unwarranted aggression. The officers in the new unit won’t wear uniforms but will wear jackets with police insignia, a slight departure from the past where officers were required to wear the shield identifying themselves as officers outside their outermost layer of clothing.\n\n“In many communities, that is a sign that you’re about to be attacked,” Adams said about plainclothes cops jumping out of their car. “That has created a lot of hostility. We are going to make sure that the version of plainclothes officers will have modified police attire so that they are quickly identified as police officers.\n\n‘Real accountability’ is necessary\n\nAccording to experts, for the most part, unmarked cars and officers in baseball caps and oversized shirts weren’t fooling anyone, but it’s a common defense for someone who runs from the police that they didn’t know the person chasing them was an officer. And the reason for a lighter duty belt was for it to be easier to give chase.\n\n“Defense attorneys are gonna do what they do … What are they going to say, (their client) knew he was the police and ran? You could be wearing a clown outfit and (the defense attorney) would say (their client) didn’t know it was a clown,” Giacalone said.\n\nMina said unmarked cars, especially at night, can buy an officer a few seconds of advantage. Being able to get a little closer, or evading detection for even a couple more seconds, is sometimes all an officer needs to capture someone evading custody.\n\n“If you’re standing there (selling drugs), you’re not going to throw dope or run every time you see a car that’s not marked. They’re looking, don’t get me wrong. And in some cases, we catch ‘em sleeping, not paying attention. But it buys you a few more seconds,” he said. “The idea is they get just a little bit closer than a marked unit, and sometimes even a second or two is helpful … you’re not fooling anyone but it will get you a little closer and buy you a second or two of hesitation.”\n\nThe units also came to be associated with NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy. Stop-and-frisk, where police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious, had been used to deter crime, law enforcement officials have said in the past in defense of the tactic. But it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops.\n\nIn August 2013, a federal judge ruled that stop-and-frisk violated the Constitution and ordered the city to develop remedies, including a federal monitor overseeing the NYPD.\n\nCharney, now with the CCRB, was the plaintiff’s attorney in the landmark stop-and-frisk case that ended the practice in New York. It was the same case where Mayor Adams – then a state senator, testified that he had a sit-down with then New York Gov. David Paterson and the NYPD commissioner at the time, Ray Kelly, regarding a stop-and-frisk bill.\n\nAdams testified that Kelly said the policy targeted Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately, “because he wanted to instill fear in them, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by police,” according to court records. Kelly denied that assertion.\n\n“I think this time around, we really need to learn from the lessons of the past and make sure that there is going to be real accountability and oversight for these officers. And frankly, any officers in the police department,” Charney said.\n\nGiacalone said Adams’ first test will come with the unit’s first high-profile use of force.\n\n“When something goes bad, and always something will happen … whether a situation goes sideways, or there’s a questionable shooting, going after people with guns and violent crimes, things will happen. Does Adams have the stomach to deal with what comes next? That’s the whole thing.”", "authors": ["Mark Morales Peter Nickeas", "Mark Morales", "Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/953102/operation-trojan-shield-anom-messaging-app-sting-800-criminals-arrested", "title": "Operation Trojan Shield: 800 criminals arrested in global FBI ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

Sign up\n\nInside the sting\n\nThe seeds of Operation Trojan Shield were sown in 2017, when “the FBI in San Diego began investigating a secure messaging system” – named “Phantom Secure” – that was “being marketed exclusively to organised crime groups”, The Telegraph says.\n\nVincent Ramos, the CEO of Phantom Secure, was arrested in Las Vegas in 2019, leaving what police in New Zealand have described as “a significant void in the encrypted communication market”. “At this point”, The Telegraph says, “an anonymous informant… offered up his or her new tech to investigators”. And instead of “waiting for criminals to fill the niche, the FBI decided to enter the market themselves”.\n\nThe sting operation got under way in 2019, when the FBI began covertly operating the encrypted device network ANOM, before spreading devices with the chat app installed on them throughout the criminal underworld through a series of informants.\n\n“ANOM devices were cellphones that had been stripped of all normal functions”, The New York Times (NYT) reports. They had just one working app “disguised as the calculator function”, allowing “users to send messages and photos with end-to-end encryption”.\n\nAccessing the ANOM network required entering a code provided by another user and the phones could only be used to message other ANOM phones. They sold on the black market for around $2,000 (£1,400).\n\nDuring the three-year operation, around 12,000 encrypted devices were distributed throughout more than 300 criminal syndicates in over 100 countries, Europol says, giving police an insight into “Italian organised crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs and international drug trafficking organisations”.\n\n“Users trusted the devices’ security so much that they often laid out their plans not in code, but in plain language”, the NYT says. But “unbeknown to them” they were actually falling foul of an operation of “unprecedented scope” that saw the FBI and 16 other countries exploit the intelligence.\n\nThe “biggest and most sophisticated crime sting in history” saw various police forces manage to put the phones “into the hands of some of the most influential crime bosses on the planet”, The Telegraph says.\n\nAustralian fugitive and alleged drug trafficker Hakan Ayik was key to the operation, unwittingly recommending the app to his associates after being given a handset by undercover officers, Australian police said.\n\nAnd after pulling off the “immense technological craft” needed to coordinate the sting, “the pay-off from the coordinated global raids announced on Tuesday was enormous”, The Telegraph adds.\n\nGlobal raids\n\nPolice in at least 16 countries including Australia, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Norway, New Zealand, Britain, Germany and the United States were involved in a series of coordinated raids yesterday.\n\nThe UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) said it carried out “multiple operations” as part of Operation Trojan Shield. A spokesperson said the agency “conducted multiple operations targeting organised crime groups involved in drug trafficking and money laundering”.\n\n“This operation has demonstrated that, in the face of the rapidly evolving threat from criminals exploiting the fast expansion of technology, the NCA is committed to working across international borders to target organised criminals, wherever they are and however they communicate”, it added.\n\n“Australian police said they had disrupted 21 murder plots and seized 3.7 tonnes of drugs during the operation”, the Financial Times reports, adding that “9,000 officers had taken part” in raids this week culminating in “224 arrests in Australia and 35 in New Zealand”.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: “The Australian government, as part of a global operation, has struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world.”\n\nSwedish police said they had “thwarted at least 10 murders and arrested 155 suspects”, including several “leading figures in the criminal network, who have had a major influence in the drugs market, and at the same time have ordered violent acts in the form of, for instance, shootings”, The Telegraph reports.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany, “70 people were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in drugs and weapons and 150 properties were raided across the country”, the paper adds. Local officials said Finnish police made almost 100 arrests, while 49 people were detained in the Netherlands.\n\nThe FBI did not break down the number of arrests for each country, however, the bureau unsealed an indictment against 17 people for distributing the ANOM devices. “Eight have so far been arrested, while the rest are on the run”, the BBC says.\n\nThe ANOM app is still operational. But as of Tuesday it had switched its previous tagline – “enforce your right to privacy” – for a new message inviting users to “discuss how your account has been linked to an ongoing investigation” by entering their account details, the NYT adds.", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Theara Coleman", "Rebekah Evans", "Felicity Capon", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/us/uvalde-police-consequences-texas-shooting/index.html", "title": "Texas shooting: Uvalde officers involved in school massacre may ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe release this week of 82 minutes of school surveillance video from the May massacre in Uvalde, Texas, is fueling scrutiny over what, if any, consequences officers might face for their decision to retreat from gunfire and wait an hour to confront the shooter inside the school where he killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers.\n\nThe much-anticipated Texas House Investigative Committee’s preliminary report into the most deadly American school shooting in nearly a decade is expected soon, though it’s not clear how wide-ranging the panel’s work has been or what might result from its probe.\n\nSo far, the person said to have been in charge during the May 24 shooting – the school district’s police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo – has been slammed by the slain children’s parents, local elected leaders and fellow law enforcement officials who claim he failed to follow training and wrongly delayed entry for more than an hour into the classroom where officers killed the gunman. Armed officers from several agencies milled about while the gunman was free to move around adjoining classrooms, the video published by the Austin American-Statesman shows.\n\nArredondo – who’s said he neither considered himself the incident commander nor instructed officers to refrain from breaching the scene – resigned the Uvalde City Council seat he assumed just a week after the attack. But formal repercussions for him – and any others from at least eight agencies involved in the police response – remain largely elusive.\n\nThe consequences could be criminal, administrative or civil. But varying standards in each of these jurisdictions and conflicting rules governing investigations reflect “a persistent problem in police accountability,” said Seth Stoughton, professor of law at the University of South Carolina.\n\n“It’s not just this case – it’s in many cases.” Competing priorities, he said, might pit whether it’s “more important to figure out what happened or to figure how to avoid it in the future. Or more to hold an officer individually liable in some way, criminally or civilly. They can run right smack into each other.”\n\nAlso investigating the attack at Robb Elementary School is the Texas Department of Public Safety. But publicly, at least, it’s unclear precisely which facets of the incident it’s delving into and which standards it’s trying to uphold – to say nothing of what the probe might yield. Similar questions linger over inquiries other agencies might be undertaking.\n\nThe Department of Justice also is investigating the shooting, aiming to “provide this definitive, independent accounting,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in June on C-SPAN. The review “is not a criminal investigation,” she added.\n\nMany of at least eight agencies whose officers responded to the school that day haven’t responded to CNN’s requests for comment. Others have declined to answer questions about their role in the emergency response.\n\nOfficials’ repeated revisions in the case narrative since the hours immediately after the attack have made a true and full understanding of the law enforcement response impossible so far. And given the fraught backdrop of American gun violence against which the facts are unfolding, it’s unclear what consequences may result.\n\nStill, what’s known in this case and of general policing standards suggest this is what the fallout for officers could look like:\n\nCriminal charges for failure to act unlikely, experts say\n\nThe crux of the police response that’s captured utmost public attention is the time that passed with the shooter alive in the school: at least 70 minutes.\n\nIt’s unlikely criminal charges would be filed against responding officers – and more unlikely they would stick – over alleged inaction or allegations they didn’t quickly enough kill the shooter, Stoughton told CNN.\n\nProsecutors have discretion in filing charges, so it’s not impossible, but the bar is high for criminal accountability for inaction.\n\n“We only punish an omission – a failure to do something – when there’s a specific legal requirement, a legal duty, for someone to do what they’ve failed to do,” Stoughton said. “Here, what we’re looking for is legal duty that required officers to go in earlier than they did. And I’m not aware of one.”\n\nAfter the Parkland, Florida, high school massacre, a prosecutor charged an officer under a state “caregiver” law for an alleged failure to act during the shooting that left 17 dead. He has pleaded not guilty to seven counts, with a trial set for 2023.\n\n“The caretaker statute applies to teachers: They have to affirmatively safeguard (the) well-being of kids. Because he’s a school resource officer, the prosecutor is arguing the statute that applies to caregivers counts because he’s, arguing (the officer) is in position like a teacher,” Stoughton said.\n\n“It is a bit of a stretch,” he allowed, “and we don’t even have that” in the Uvalde case.\n\nIndeed, it’s not clear if any particular law in Texas would have obligated such an officer to act in any specific way, he said. It’s also not clear if any prosecutor is considering insufficient action by law enforcement.\n\nAs to finding criminal fault with officers’ actions that day, prosecutors are in a “really difficult position,” said Carol Archbold, chair of the criminal justice department at North Dakota State University.\n\n“The odds are slim that they would actually bring charges and have the charges stick,” she said. “This is involving children, loss of life of children, which is tragic. … There’s something that sparks outrage or an outcry for accountability from the public because it’s involving children.\n\n“So, prosecutors are put in a position where they have to obviously follow the law but at the same time have to deal with balancing public opinion or outcry,” she told CNN.\n\nScope of administrative reviews is unclear\n\nWhen an officer fires their gun or responds to a chaotic mass-casualty incident, police departments typically conduct internal reviews or invite third parties to do so, with their sights set on determining whether departmental rules were followed before and after the event and the roles each officer played. Most police departments also have broad “conduct unbecoming” rules, and agencies may also have specific active-shooter protocols or other written standards.\n\n“Conduct unbecoming” clauses typically would be the easiest way for an agency to discipline officers, Stoughton said.\n\n“In some ways, that’s the easiest to imagine in a case like this because all they have to do to be administratively liable, sanctioned or disciplined is violate policies or training,” he said. “And even if no specific policy that says go in there get active shooter, they can say, ‘Look … you’re trained to do a thing, you didn’t do that thing, you didn’t do what you’re expected to do.’”\n\nBut even that depends on whether lower-ranking officers were ordered to wait, he said.\n\nWhile it’s not clear what type of training or orders regarding active shooter incidents each Uvalde responding agency has, consequences in general for violating such law enforcement rules range from a verbal scolding to being fired. Disciplinary processes usually give officers a chance to contest allegations. And even termination can be uncertain: At least one deputy who responded to the Parkland school massacre and was fired for inaction got his job back after his union contested the firings.\n\nArredondo, for his part, was placed on administrative leave June 22.\n\nWhile much of the public focus after the Uvalde mass shooting has been on whether officers moved quickly enough into the classroom where some eventually killed the shooter, administrative reviews also could look at whether officers followed training and orders before going in and how they handled information and evidence afterward.\n\nAt least three federal, two state and three local agencies responded to the carnage at Robb Elementary – but it’s not clear which may be conducting such investigations or their status.\n\n“It’s good that you have different set of eyes looking at the case because they’re likely to find something another agency or individual didn’t find,” Archbold said.\n\n“I’m not really sure what’s going to happen or how long it will take, but given so many people are looking, at some point we’re going to learn what happened,” Archbold said. “It just may not be quickly.”\n\nMeantime, an examination of who’s looking at what reveals a tangle of interests: The district attorney’s investigator in Uvalde County, for instance, was part of the police response on May 24, along with the state police agency – the Texas Department of Public Safety – which is handling the broader criminal investigation. And the state legislative committee is relying on testimony from department personnel in producing its report.\n\nIt’s not clear if those two agencies are subject to any outside scrutiny that could result in administrative accountability or whether there are internal investigations into their officers’ conduct that day. The county district attorney declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers didn’t respond to a request for comment. Spokespersons for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department, the school district itself and the Uvalde Police Department also didn’t respond.\n\nThe Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University is producing after-action reports with the “explicit purpose of identifying training gaps to be addressed by police officers across the state of Texas.” But it’s not clear whether any agencies with officers on scene that day will use those reports in seeking administrative action against officers. The agency trains first responders across the country in response to “active attack situations.”\n\nCivil lawsuits mean a high bar for plaintiffs\n\nCivil litigation may be another way families of victims could seek accountability.\n\nSo far, a state legislator in Texas has sued for access to public records related to the mass shooting, and the families of four victims have sued the estate of the shooter. It appears no lawsuits have been filed against law enforcement in which the claim relates to the quality of the police response, though a San Antonio attorney said in late June he plans to file such a suit by mid-July.\n\nIf they’re sued, agencies could settle in a way that shields them from having to make any public statements about their role in responding to the shooting. But if government agencies fight any suits, the bar for holding officers liable for inaction would be high, Stoughton said.\n\nIt isn’t just that officers didn’t act, he said: They had to have made it worse.\n\n“These are really tough cases, though, because the standard the Supreme Court has set for failure to protect is that police – government generally, but here, police – the only legal duty to protect is when police themselves create the danger or make it worse.” Stoughton said.\n\nNot acting – in this case, not confronting the gunman sooner – isn’t typically sufficient for a civil claim to result favorably for the plaintiff, he said.\n\nGrieving Uvalde families have condemned police as “cowards,” and parents have expressed worries about children who survived but couldn’t save their friends. But it’s not clear if those conclusions would be enough to yield a win in court against a police agency.\n\n“The easy way to understand this is: Did police create the danger or make the existing danger worse?” he said. “Not just did they allow it to occur, but did they make it worse?”\n\nFederal review aims for ‘lessons learned’\n\nWhile the Department of Justice is helping local authorities investigate the massacre by providing expertise and processing evidence, the goal of its “Critical Incident Review” is to document “lessons learned and best practices” for first responders.\n\n“I want to be clear: This is not a criminal investigation,” Gupta said in June. “Obviously, the department has criminal investigative authority, and we prosecute officers for violating the law when that happens, but this is an after-action review, which is another tool that the department has … to be able to provide a definitive accounting.”\n\nThe federal agency will look at video and other evidence to “reconstruct the timeline,” looking at what happened before, during and after the massacre to “provide this definitive, independent accounting,” she said, reiterating: “It is not a criminal investigation.”", "authors": ["Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/30/police-pursuits-fatal-injuries/30187827/", "title": "High-speed police chases have killed thousands of innocent ...", "text": "Thomas Frank, USA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story used an incorrect first name for Maj. Travis Yates\n\nMore than 5,000 bystanders and passengers have been killed in police car chases since 1979, and tens of thousands more were injured as officers repeatedly pursued drivers at high speeds and in hazardous conditions, often for minor infractions, a USA TODAY analysis shows.\n\nThe bystanders and the passengers in chased cars account for nearly half of all people killed in police pursuits from 1979 through 2013, USA TODAY found. Most bystanders were killed in their own cars by a fleeing driver.\n\nPolice across the USA chase tens of thousands of people each year -- usually for traffic violations or misdemeanors -- often causing drivers to speed away recklessly. Recent cases show the danger of the longstanding police practice of chasing minor offenders.\n\nA 25-year-old New Jersey man was killed July 18 by a driver police chased for running a red light.\n\nA 63-year-old Indianapolis grandmother was killed June 7 by a driver police chased four miles for shoplifting.\n\nA 60-year-old federal worker was killed March 19 near Washington, D.C., by a driver police chased because his headlights were off.\n\n\"The police shouldn't have been chasing him. That was a big crowded street,\" said Evelyn Viverette, 83, mother of federal worker Charlie Viverette. \"He wouldn't have hit my son if the police hadn't been chasing him.\"\n\nSome police say drivers who flee are suspicious, and chasing them maintains law and order. \"When crooks think they can do whatever they choose, that will just fester and foster more crimes,\" said Milwaukee Police Detective Michael Crivello, who is president of the city's police union.\n\nMany in law enforcement, including the Justice Department, have recognized the danger of high-speed chases and urge officers to avoid or abort pursuits that endanger pedestrians, nearby motorists or themselves. At least 139 police have been killed in chases, federal records show.\n\n\"A pursuit is probably the most unique and dangerous job law enforcement can do,\" said Tulsa Police Maj. Travis Yates, who runs a national pursuit-training academy.\n\nThe Justice Department called pursuits \"the most dangerous of all ordinary police activities\" in 1990 and urged police departments to adopt policies listing exactly when officers can and cannot pursue someone. \"Far more police vehicle chases occur each year than police shootings,\" the department said.\n\nPolice chases have killed nearly as many people as justifiable police shootings, according to government figures, which are widely thought to under count fatal shootings. Yet chases have escaped the national attention paid to other potentially lethal police tactics.\n\nDespite the Justice Department's warning, the number of chase-related deaths in 2013 was higher than the number in 1990 — 322 compared to 317, according to records of the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which analyzes all fatal motor-vehicle crashes.\n\nMany police departments still let officers make on-the-spot judgments about whether to chase based on their perception of a driver's danger to the public. Officers continue to violate pursuit policies concerning when to avoid or stop a chase, police records show. And federally funded high-tech systems that would obviate chases, such as vehicle tracking devices, are undeveloped or rarely used due to cost.\n\nWhile cities such as Milwaukee and Orlando allow chases only of suspected violent felons, many departments let officers chase anyone if they decide the risk of letting someone go free outweighs the risk of a pursuit.\n\nAt least 11,506 people, including 6,300 fleeing suspects, were killed in police chases from 1979 through 2013, most recent year for which NHTSA records are available. That's an average of 329 a year — nearly one person a day.\n\nBut those figures likely understate the actual death toll because NHTSA uses police reports to determine if a crash was chase-related, and some reports do not disclose that a chase occurred.\n\nKansas, Michigan and Minnesota state records all show more chase-related deaths than NHTSA shows for those states.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment,\" said Geoffrey Alpert of the University of South Carolina, a leading researcher on police pursuits who has done numerous Justice Department studies. NHTSA records \"are the only national database we have on these fatalities, and it's been consistently wrong.\"\n\nThe number of innocent bystanders killed is impossible to pinpoint because hundreds of NHTSA's records fail to show whether a victim was killed in a car fleeing police or in a car that happened to be hit during a chase.\n\nAnalyzing each fatal crash, USA TODAY determined that at least 2,456 bystanders were killed, although the death toll could be as high as 2,750. The newspaper found that 55% of those killed were drivers fleeing police. They ranged from armed-robbery suspects to a 10-year-old boy chased as he drove a pick-up truck 85 mph on a county road before hitting a tree, killing himself and his 7-year-old passenger.\n\nInjuries are even harder to count because NHTSA keeps records of only fatal crashes.\n\nHowever, records from six states show that 17,600 people were hurt in chases from 2004 through 2013 — an average of 1,760 injuries a year in those states, which make up 24% of the U.S. population.\n\nThose numbers suggest that chases nationwide may have injured 7,400 people a year — more than 270,000 people since 1979.\n\nThe uncertainty about the death and injury tolls obscures the danger of police chases, said Jonathan Farris, who became an advocate for pursuit safety after his son Paul, 23, was killed in 2007 by a motorist being chased for an illegal driving maneuver. \"If the public understood the number of pursuits that were going on and the number of people who were being injured or killed, there would be a much better dialogue as to what types of crimes should be pursued,\" Farris said.\n\nAlthough police-camera footage often depicts the drama of squad cars racing after motorists, most chases begin benignly, with an attempted traffic stop. And most end quickly — 76% were over within five minutes, according to records of tens of thousands of chases in California.\n\nCalifornia records of 63,500 chases from 2002 through 2014 show that:\n\nMore than 89% were for vehicle-code violations, including speeding, vehicle theft, reckless driving, and 4,898 instances of a missing license plate or an expired registration\n\nJust 5% were an attempt to nab someone suspected of a violent crime, usually assault or robbery; 168 sought a known murder suspect\n\nNearly 1,000 were for safety violations that endangered a driver only, including 850 drivers not wearing a seat belt and 23 motorcycle riders not wearing a helmet\n\nIn 90 instances, police chased someone for driving too slowly\n\n\"We don't know that the person in that car is just speeding or just had a headlight out ... [or] if they had just committed a felony,\" said Joseph Farrow, commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, which chased 14,628 motorists from 2007 through 2014, resulting in 4,052 crashes, 2,198 injuries and 103 deaths.\n\nThat's a 28% crash rate and a 15% injury rate.\n\nMinnesota safety researchers found in 2008 that 35% to 40% of chases resulted in a crash.\n\n\"There's no question that when you're engaging in a chase, you're engaging in something that can turn out many ways, and many are bad outcomes,\" said John Firman of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, whose survey of 17,000 chases nationally since 2001 shows that 92% began for a traffic violation, misdemeanor or non-violent felony such as car theft.\n\nPolice often suspect fleeing drivers are wanted for a serious offense. And they dislike letting a violator get away. During a chase police can be overcome by \"a need to 'win' and make the arrest,\" which blinds them to the danger they are helping create, a 2010 FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin reported.\n\n\"These are folks who are proud and who see their job as going out and putting the bad guy in jail,\" said Assistant Chief Randall Blankenbaker of the Dallas Police Department, which sharply restricts chases.\n\nWhen police in Beech Grove, Ind., were called June 8 at 8:07 a.m. about a shoplifting from a Walmart, they pulled behind the suspect's car in a parking lot and flashed their emergency lights. Driver Matthew Edmonds allegedly sped off on a busy thoroughfare, with police chasing for four miles until stopping because of the danger. Moments later, Edmonds allegedly sped through an intersection and hit a pick-up truck driven by 63-year-old Donna Niblock, killing her and seriously injuring her daughter and 11-year-old grandson.\n\nThe chase followed department guidelines, which allow \"high-risk\" pursuits for drivers suspected of property crimes, Beech Grove Detective Capt. Robert Mercuri said.\n\n\"We don't know who may be in that vehicle. We don't know if they have somebody tied up in the back seat,\" Mercuri said. \"It could have been Ted Bundy.\"\n\nFew drivers fleeing police are wanted felons, according to statistics and research. Most committed minor offenses and \"made very bad decisions to flee,\" a 2008 paper by the Police Foundation said.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, records of 32,000 chases since 1997 show that the most common charge against fleeing drivers was theft, including stealing or illegally possessing the car they were driving. The other most-frequent charges were resisting arrest, underage drinking and misdemeanor assault.\n\nA Justice Department-funded 1998 study found after interviewing fleeing drivers that 32% drove off because they were in a stolen car, 27% because they had a suspended driver's license, 27% wanted to avoid arrest and 21% because they were driving drunk.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly, someone is fleeing because they've got a minor warrant, their car isn't insured, they've had too much to drink,\" said Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, who sharply restricted his department's pursuits in 2010 after four bystanders were killed in a three-month span.\n\nFor more serious offenses such as stealing a vehicle, \"the sanctions imposed by courts nationwide for merely stealing a car don't justify anybody taking any risk,\" Flynn said.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, at 3:20 p.m., Austin, Texas, police chased a driver in a stolen pickup truck at 90 to 95 mph onto a highway and along a frontage road lined with service stations and fast-food restaurants. At an intersection, the truck slammed into a Mitsubishi driven by James Williford, 32, killing him instantly.\n\nDriver Reynaldo Hernandez was convicted of murdering Williford and sentenced to 55 years. The Austin police chief cleared the two officers, saying they followed the policy of the department, which had been cracking down on auto thefts.\n\nWilliford's widow Esther Seoanes holds the officers responsible for deciding to chase a stolen car.\n\n\"My husband,\" Seoanes said, \"was essentially killed for a stolen vehicle.\"\n\n\"The moment the officer crossed over the median with lights and sirens and started the pursuit, he (Hernandez) immediately turned into one of those criminals and suspects who doesn't care about anything,\" said Seoanes, executive director of PursuitSAFETY, a nonprofit seeking to reduce chase-related deaths. \"Drivers, they don't care about anyone's safety, and so the burden falls on the police to protect the public.\"\n\nAustin police declined to comment due to Seoanes' pending lawsuit against them.\n\nSome relatives of killed bystanders don't hold police responsible for deaths in chases.\n\n\"I'm not blaming the police,\" Nicole Jackson of Detroit said after a driver who allegedly had a gun sped away from police on June 24 and killed Jackson's granddaughter and grandson, age 3 and 6, while they were riding scooters near their home. \"I'm blaming the person who did all this.\"\n\nChases are inherently dangerous because of their speed, and police often compound the danger by chasing drivers in hazardous conditions.\n\nAt least 3,440 people were killed in crashes when a driver was fleeing at 25 mph or more over the speed limit, NHTSA records show. The actual death toll from such high-speed chases is likely much higher, but is not known because only half of NHTSA's records show a fleeing driver's speed and the speed limit.\n\nParticularly dangerous are chases on wet or icy roads, and pursuits of inexperienced and risk-prone teen-age drivers and of motorcyclists, who have little crash protection.\n\nIn Michigan over the past decade, 74% of motorcyclists fleeing police were killed, injured or possibly injured when they crashed, state records show. Just 18% of chased car drivers were killed, injured or possibly injured in a crash.\n\nPolice departments routinely warn officers about hazardous road conditions and high-risk drivers. Some bar motorcycle cops from pursuits because of the danger if an officer crashes.\n\nYet nearly one-third of the police-chase deaths involved one of those three high-risk factors, USA TODAY found.\n\nThat includes 1,132 motorcyclists who were killed while being chased. More than half — 589 — were not wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Most police departments don't allow their motorcycles to be in pursuits, so why would you chase one?\" said Alpert, the South Carolina researcher. \"Motorcycle drivers are either going to get away or they're going to get killed.\"\n\nMichigan State Police must consider \"road and weather conditions\" in deciding whether to chase, and can pursue only people suspected of a \"life-threatening felony\" or drivers who pose \"an immediate threat to the safety of the public.\" The policy cautions, \"It is better to either delay the arrest or abandon the pursuit than to needlessly injure or kill innocent people.\"\n\nThe Michigan State Police have been involved in 44 deadly chases over the past decade, 120 motorcycle chases that resulted in a crash, and 212 chases on wet or icy roads that resulted in a crash, state records show.\n\nMost chases are short, said state police Chief of Staff Capt. Greg Zarotney, and in those cases \"road condition rarely has a bearing on the crash.\" As for motorcycle chases, Zarotney said, \"keep in mind that a pursuit only occurs when a decision is made by a driver to flee.\"\n\nAlthough police chases have been recognized as dangerous for nearly half a century, both training and technology remain inadequate, experts say.\n\nThe average police trainee received 72 hours of weapons training compared to 40 hours of driving training, only a portion of which covered chases, according to a 2006 Justice Department study of police training academies.\n\nA 2007 survey of Florida Highway Patrol sergeants showed that 80% thought that patrol officers \"did not have adequate training in the area of pursuit driving.\" Highway Patrol spokesman Lieut. Ryan Martina did not respond to repeated inquires about how the patrol responded to the poll.\n\n\"We're not taking it seriously enough because we think that one day of training that an officer may have gotten in their academy is going to take effect 10 years later when a pursuit begins,\" said Maj. Travis Yates, the Tulsa expert on police chases. \"Most officers will never fire their firearms ever, but we train one to four times a year\" on using guns.\n\nChases have been left behind in the modernization of police equipment that is now moving toward outfitting officers with body cameras. President Obama in December proposed $75 million in federal funds to buy 50,000 body cameras in the effort to \"build and sustain trust\" between police and communities.\n\nPolice use of Tasers, body armor, cameras and computers in patrol cars has soared, Justice Department reports show. In 2007, 90% of police worked for a department that used portable computers. In 1990, that figure was 30%.\n\nYet the principal \"technology\" for chases are tire spikes — two decades old and seldom used because police must know where a fleeing car is heading so they can pull a strip of spikes across a road. Police in Minnesota used spikes in only 3% of the nearly 1,000 chases in the state in 2014, state records show.\n\nA Justice Department overview notes that spikes \"can put both the officers and other motorists in danger.\" Houston police officer Richard Martin was killed May 18 when a fleeing driver swerved and hit him as he was laying spikes.\n\n\"There's been a lot of advances in police technology in the last 15 years. The pursuit-termination devices we envisioned haven't kept up with those advances,\" said Farrow, the California Highway Patrol commissioner.\n\nA federal effort to develop advanced systems has fallen well short of the hype of a 1996 Justice Department bulletin headline, \"High-Speed Pursuit: New Technologies Around the Corner.\" Federal justice and transportation officials began studying improvements to pursuit safety after a controversial 1968 study by Physicians for Automotive Safety said that 70% of police chases result in crashes.\n\nDevices that would shut off the engines of moving cars by transmitting microwaves are not commercially available a decade after the Justice Department funded their development. \"It's very frustrating that we haven't gotten to that next stage,\" said Bill Miera, owner of Fiore Industries of New Mexico, which tried to build the devices with the help of a $300,000 federal grant but ran short of money.\n\nA device that shoots a small, adhesive GPS tag onto a car exterior was introduced for police in 2010, but is used by only 20 of the nation's 18,000 police departments. Attaching a GPS tag lets police stop their chase — which prompts fleeing drivers to slow down — and follow the car by computer until it stops, where they can make an arrest.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety has embedded the systems in seven cars and uses them every time an officer can get within 30 feet of a fleeing vehicle, Capt. Chris Hemmen said. After tagging a car, police shadow it from a couple of blocks away. \"As soon as they stop, we're able to pounce,\" Hemmen said.\n\nHouston Police considered the devices after Martin's death but declined because officers still have to pursue a car and get close enough to fire the remote-controlled GPS tag from a launcher mounted behind the grill of a police car, department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said.\n\nThe $5,000 purchase cost also deters departments, which often spend capital funds and federal grants on routine items such as car tires and hiring more officers, said Trevor Fischbach, president of StarChase LLC, the manufacturer, which got a $380,000 federal grant.\n\n\"We're in the 21st Century,\" Fischbach said. \"We should be using 21st-century tools that are available.\"\n\nPolice departments that restrict chases have faced resistance from officers.\n\nIn 2012, the Florida Highway Patrol changed from a policy that allowed officers to chase anyone, to a policy that allowed pursuits only of suspected felons, drunk drivers and reckless drivers. The number of highway patrol pursuits fell almost in half: from 697 in 2010 - 2011, to 374 in 2013 - 2014.\n\nBut 35% of the pursuits in 2013 and 2014 violated the new chase restrictions, state reports show.\n\nDallas police used to ignore a policy that required them to stop chasing drivers who fled for traffic violations and appeared unlikely to stop, said Randall Blankenbaker, the assistant police chief. When the department in 2006 adopted an even stricter policy limiting chases to suspected violent felons, \"there were some folks who were resistant,\" said Blankenbaker, who wrote the policy.\n\nMilwaukee police still oppose Chief Flynn's 2010 policy restricting chases to suspected violent felons and people who present \"a clear and imminent threat to the safety of others.\"\n\n\"The crooks understand that this is our process,\" said Michael Crivello, the police union president. \"Criminals know their car is almost like their safe locker. They can keep drugs and guns in their safe locker.\"\n\nMotor-vehicle thefts in Milwaukee policy spiked to 18 a day in 2014, from 12 a day in 2013.\n\nFlynn said car theft \"became sport\" among juveniles. \"These kids were finding out, well, nothing happens to me. They had the prestige of being cool to their friends, the thrill of the danger and no consequences,\" Flynn said, adding that 70% of cars stolen in the city are recovered.\n\nOther cities have seen crime plunge since restricting chases. The Dallas crime rate has plummeted since 2006 — from 81 crimes per 1,000 residents to 48 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2013, according to FBI crime reports. City police have been involved in only one fatal chase since 2006, Blankenbaker said.\n\nPhoenix and Orlando also have seen their crime rates fall substantially since adopting policies that allow pursuits only for suspected violent felons, FBI reports show.\n\nMany departments base their chase policies on a three-page model the International Association of Chiefs of Police wrote in 1996. The model stops short of the Justice Department recommendation to list the offenses and conditions such as time of day in which a chase is allowed. The model instead lists factors to consider such as road and weather conditions, traffic levels, and the seriousness of a driver's offense.\n\nFlynn restricted chases after four bystanders were killed over three months in 2009 and 2010. Immediately after the deaths, Flynn defended his officers, noting they followed department policy and had actually stopped their pursuits only to have the fleeing drivers continue speeding away and hit the bystanders. Fleeing drivers typically continue speeding for a minute or two after police stop their chase, studies show.\n\n\"I thought to myself, it's not enough that we have a policy that tells our officers to terminate pursuits when they become unsafe. That was the industry standard,\" Flynn said. \"I needed an extra line to stop the pursuit in the first place, not because the officers were driving recklessly, but because we can't control the behavior for those who refuse to stop for police.\"\n\nContributing: Mark Hannan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/watchdog/shield/2018/01/22/nj-police-brutality-cases-secret-settlements/109479668/", "title": "NJ police brutality: Secret settlements keep bad cops on street ...", "text": "Killed. Beaten. Stalked. More than 200 citizens across the state have been victimized in recent years by out-of-control rogue cops. In many cases, the cops kept their jobs, even got promoted – while tens of millions of your tax dollars kept the abuses quiet. Until now.\n\nPiercing the shield\n\nNew Jersey governments across the state, from the smallest towns to some of the largest cities, have spent more than $42 million this decade to cover-up deaths, physical abuses and sexual misconduct at the hands of bad cops.\n\nThe abuse of police power has left a staggering toll: at least 19 dead; 131 injured; 7 sexual misconducts, plus dozens of other offenses ranging from false arrest to harassment, a two-year investigation by the Asbury Park Press found.\n\nMiguel Feliz struggled to extinguish his burning flesh after a car crash in Jersey City June 4, 2017. He needed help from the police. Instead he was kicked. Andrew Ford\n\nThe damage is concealed by government officials who use a veil of secret settlements and nondisclosure agreements to silence victims. Investigations of rogue cops are routinely hidden from the public by police, elected officials and even the courts.\n\nThe secretive payouts that keep abuses quiet are a vital part of a system that enables bad cops to do their worst. The secrecy starts at the police department and rises through the highest levels of government. Some of the state's largest cities and insurance carriers refused to release government documents that are at the core of the rogue cop problem.\n\nBut the tens of millions of dollars paid to settle hundreds of legal claims are not the worst part.\n\nMany of the bad cops remain on the street.\n\nThe Press investigation found that several towns knew of their bad cops' propensity towards violence yet ignored multiple warning signs until the cops crossed the line by injuring or killing innocent people.\n\nMeet Jersey City’s MD Khan, a violent cop.\n\nLawyer Daniel Welsh, left, with his client, former police officer MD Khan. Courtesy of NJ.com\n\nIn February 2016, Khan was arrested on charges of punching his brother-in-law in the face, causing “serious facial injuries and a possible fractured” eye socket and jaw, and threatening to shoot him, a police report stated.\n\nKhan brushed off the criminal charges as a grand jury dismissed the claims. His only punishment: a 40-day police department suspension. After that, the officer returned to the streets, armed with a weapon and the full force of the law.\n\nKhan’s suspension didn't prevent more violence. During a car chase that could have been a scene from an action movie, Khan shot at a suspect fleeing in a vehicle and then pursued the car through the streets of Jersey City, according to criminal charges filed against him.\n\nThe June 4, 2017, chase ended tragically for Miguel Feliz, 28, an innocent victim caught in the mayhem.\n\nMiguel Feliz Staff photo\n\nThe father of a 6-year-old was driving home from his Peapod grocery delivery job when the suspect ran Feliz's aging Toyota off the road. The car burst into flames after slamming into a utility pole.\n\nWith his clothing on fire and choking on the acrid smoke, Feliz needed help from the police.\n\nHe got Khan.\n\nKhan and another officer kicked Feliz as he laid burning on the ground. Feliz was struck in the face, a cellphone video shot by a passerby showed. Months later, both officers were indicted on aggravated assault charges. The officers have pleaded not guilty.\n\n“I thought they were there to help,” Feliz said weeks after the incident, healing from four broken ribs – inflicted by police, he says – and multiple burns.\n\n\"But obviously not.\"\n\nIn another state, Khan's first arrest would likely have been his last day as a police officer. In Florida, conduct involving an assault can cost a police officer’s license to enforce the law, even if they're not criminally prosecuted.\n\nBut not in New Jersey.\n\nFrom internal affairs to the courthouse, a weave of secret investigations, quiet payouts, nondisclosure agreements and court-enforced silence ends up keeping horrendous conduct and multi-million-dollar payouts away from public scrutiny.\n\nRogue cops are a fraction of the 33,000 officers who protect the public each day. But bad cops remain on the street because of one number: 466. That is the number of municipal police departments in the state, most with 23 or fewer officers, and some employing multiple family members.\n\nEach of the 466 departments has a unique political culture and an internal affairs system that is rarely overseen by outsiders – unless the police chief believes an officer might have committed a crime.\n\nNew Jersey is one of five states that doesn’t officially license police officers or have a method to ban bad cops, much the way the government can disbar wayward lawyers or pull the licenses of intoxicated truck drivers. The other states without a police licensing revocation law are Rhode Island, Massachusetts, California and Hawaii.\n\nOf at least 64,353 internal affairs complaints filed since 2011, less than one half of 1 percent – 226 – resulted in an officer being charged with a crime, the Press found. Of those defendants, 90 were convicted.\n\n\"There's just people out there that don't belong on the job. Fortunately, the numbers are few,\" said former Burlington Township police director Walter J. Corter, who also served as head of investigations for the Burlington County prosecutor's office.\n\nTo expose the problems with New Jersey's system for police accountability, the Press reviewed more than 30,000 pages of court, police and legal documents, settlements and once-secret separation agreements obtained by the Press, and interviewed dozens of victims, experts, lawyers and police officers.\n\nThe team found holes, conflicts and inconsistencies in police oversight that empowered problem cops in some departments to escalate their behavior until it became criminal, even deadly.\n\nConsider:\n\nA cop with domestic dispute history kills his ex-wife — Neptune Police Sgt. Philip Seidle has an internal affairs record that tops 600 pages and spans two decades, with several complaints known to involve domestic disputes between him and his wife. He was considered enough of a risk to the public that his service weapon was taken from him, but he was later rearmed. He used that gun to fatally shoot his ex-wife in 2015 in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter. He's serving a 30-year prison sentence.\n\nNeptune Police Sgt.

A well-known violent cop beats a suspect on camera — Bloomfield police officer Orlando Trinidad was known in the department for using force to subdue suspects, accounting for nearly a third of the so-called “use-of-force” police reports in the 120-member department. After nearly ripping the ear off a handcuffed suspect inside the police station in 2013, a lawsuit claims, Trinidad then looked directly into the surveillance camera to seemingly mock the ensuing internal affairs review by saying, “IA.” The suit settled for $364,000 without any admission of fault. He was sentenced to five years in prison for lying on a police report in a separate incident.\n\nBloomfield police officer Orlando Trinidad was known in the department for using force to subdue suspects, accounting for nearly a third of the so-called “use-of-force” police reports in the 120-member department.

A lack of oversight — Now-retired Bordentown Township Police Chief Frank Nucera Jr. was charged by federal agents in November 2017 with assaulting a black man and repeatedly making violent and racist remarks. The need for outside intervention by the FBI underscores the limited oversight of New Jersey's hundreds of police chiefs. His lawyer didn't return a message seeking comment. Nucera retired in January 2017, after the alleged assault but before the indictment. He is awaiting trial. Upon leaving, Nucera was paid $54,002, including compensation for unused sick and vacation days.\n\nNow-retired Bordentown Township Police Chief Frank Nucera Jr. was charged by federal agents in November 2017 with assaulting a black man and repeatedly making violent and racist remarks.

Repeated beatings claims, department inaction — Alleged beatings by Atlantic City police officer Andrew Jaques prompted at least two lawsuits. The city refused to provide the Press with the settlement amounts. But the case raised the ire of a federal judge in one decision who called Jaques \"short-fused\" and \"volatile.\" He retired on disability in August, at an annual salary of $101,620, the Press found. Another city officer, Sterling Wheaten, has been the subject of at least 15 internal affairs complaints and the city paying $4.5 million to settle five lawsuits, according to media reports. No admission of wrongdoing was made in the settlements and Wheaten remains on the force at a salary of $108,548.\n\nAlleged beatings by Atlantic City police officer Andrew Jaques prompted at least two lawsuits.

No admission of wrongdoing was made in the settlements and Wheaten remains on the force at a salary of $108,548. The $1.8 million cop — Battling a problem cop can be extraordinarily expensive. Taxpayers spent at least $1.8 million in a 9-year effort to fire Manuel Avila, a Paterson patrolman with a history of mental health trouble accused of sexual assault but acquitted at trial. Although not convicted of being a violent cop, the city put Avila on paid suspension that ultimately cost at least $940,000. The city also agreed to a $710,000 settlement with the woman, plus at least $92,000 in legal fees. In a settlement with the officer, the city agreed to dismiss disciplinary charges against Avila if he decided to resign. The agreement allowed him to collect $85,134 for unused sick and vacation time. He is now trying to get a $72,000 annual pension, which would include credit for six years while he was suspended.\n\nIn the Atlantic City case involving the “short-fused” Jaques, the Press found in court documents that Jaques was investigated by his uncle. Jaques remained on the force for another 10 years, leading to more lawsuits from civilians.\n\nThe quality of internal affairs reviews meant to root out rogue cops “comes down to one person — whoever is doing the investigation,” said Rich Rivera, a former West New York police officer.\n\nFor the last 20 years, Rivera has reviewed internal affairs investigations, police use-of-force reports in lawsuits and consulted with police departments. “Because the entire process is secret, we typically don’t know what the contents of the investigation were, and whether they were properly done or not,” he said.\n\nWhile on the police force in the mid-1990s, Rivera worked undercover with the FBI to help put corrupt cops from his department in jail.\n\nRich Rivera, a former West New York police officer Staff photo by Kala Kachmar\n\nInternal affairs reports frequently show inadequate investigations and conclusions, Rivera said of the more than 900 IA files he has reviewed. Common problems included police investigators: failing to interview eyewitnesses; ruling a complaint “unfounded” if the investigator was unable to reach the victim; and failing to interview more than one officer, even if there were several at the scene.\n\n“We don’t see too many consequences for bad police officers,” Rivera said. “The consequences are (for) those in the community – people being harmed, people being falsely accused of crimes, people being sent to prison who might not have been sent to prison if IA was working properly.”\n\nClaims of abuses affected departments regardless of size, the Press’ investigation found. For example, the tiny borough of Absecon in Atlantic County, population 8,300, paid $2 million to settle a 2012 wrongful death case while Newark, population 280,000, settled a bodily injury case for $2 million.\n\nPatrick Colligan, president of the state Police Benevolent Association that represents nearly all 33,000 police officers in the state, said he doesn’t dispute there were problem officers in the past, but today, with many cops being watched with cameras mounted on patrol cars or worn by officers, there is a constant oversight.\n\nHowever, not all departments – until recently including Jersey City – use such monitoring devices.\n\nSub-standard police officers leave the force “close to every day in this state,” Colligan said. “Many you don't hear about, and it shows the departments are doing what they should be doing. … In 2017, there's nobody tolerating illicit or illegal activity.”\n\nThe financial toll\n\nInjury, suit, settlement, silence. Repeat.\n\nThe more than $42.7 million of taxpayer money government officials have spent to hush hundreds of allegations of police abuse are enough to fund the education of 2,800 New Jersey school children this year.\n\nIn scores of lawsuits, the pattern is the same. Towns routinely take the path of least resistance, at taxpayer expense, to minimize their liability when they face a claim one of their cops violated, hurt or killed someone. Millions of taxpayer dollars are spent, nobody admits wrongdoing and officers accused of misconduct often remain in place.\n\nOf the 531 officers named in suits alleging abuses, at least 231 remain on the job after their employer settled with their accusers, a Press review of employment records found. Many others normally retired years after an allegation.\n\nFrom a budgetary view, most towns usually feel no financial pain from a lawsuit. That reduces the incentive for changing bad police behavior. A $1 million court settlement against a small town, for example, can be funded by dozens of municipalities that pool resources to form a joint insurance fund. The payouts are not announced to the public and the final amounts are usually hidden in paperwork that the public never sees.\n\nOften these lawsuits are settled before a jury can resolve the critical question of facts – was excessive force used or were the officer's actions justified?\n\nAfter a citizen files a lawsuit, lawyers for both sides and the judge frequently agree that police documents reviewed in the case will be kept secret, preventing public scrutiny of an officer's history.\n\nIn the rare event a settlement comes to light, town leaders echo the same talking points: Legal fees were mounting, but little local tax money was spent to close the case. No admission of wrongdoing was made by the town or the individuals involved. Compared to the specter of costly litigation, it’s much cheaper to settle a lawsuit, they say.\n\n\"The system is geared to try to come up with some sort of compromise,” Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. “I don't think that you just look at it and say ‘wait a minute there was a settlement here that shows there was impropriety.’ A lot of times they may say, 'you know what, between all the costs and the liabilities, the exposure, this is better to move on instead of fully litigating.' The system is not drawn that everybody can get a trial.\"\n\nBecause every case is different, no set amount determines if a settlement was done to end legal fees or to prevent a multi-million-dollar jury judgment. Of the 243 cases the Press examined from 2010 through 2017, the average settlement payout was $178,000.\n\nSome of the higher six-figure settlements include:\n\nHomicide — Michael Anthony Burris' family called for medical help after he fell in 2010 in Millville. After refusing medical attention, he became combative and police handcuffed Burris and shackled him to a stretcher. Burris eventually suffocated. His death was ruled a homicide, but no criminal charges were filed. The town paid his family $875,000 in a settlement. The city denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichael Anthony Burris' family called for medical help after he fell in 2010 in Millville.

Dubose cannot talk about the case today. “We signed a confidentiality agreement with the police department,” said his lawyer, Alfonso Gambone. “We’re not at liberty to discuss anything else on that.” The city denied wrongdoing.\n\nPhilip Dubose settled for $500,000 after he claimed he was punched, kicked and pepper sprayed by Bridgeton officers in 2013.

Teens left in a freezing van — In 2011, five teenagers were locked in a Fort Lee police van for 15 hours in below freezing temperatures with no food, water, bathroom or warm clothing, according to two lawsuits filed by two of the teens’ parents. In two separate settlements, the teens each received $120,000 from the borough. At least 11 officers named in the lawsuits are still employed by Fort Lee, and their salaries range from $129,800 to $188,976. No admission of wrongdoing was made by Fort Lee.\n\nPolice officials often say the plaintiffs who file lawsuits against officers are seeking easy money, and that police are prevented from having their day in court.\n\n“It’s so costly to defend these cases,” said Seaside Park Police Chief Francis Larkin, whose resort town of 13 officers has paid $3 million to settle police abuse allegations since 2007 – an unusually high payout figure for such a small department, the Press found. “There’s always been a hop-off point because of the cost factor involved.”\n\n“It’s a shame that money became part of the whole formula because it would be nice to go forward all the way and show that there was no excessive force used on the part of the officer,” Larkin said. “That, I always thought that there was something wrong with that.”\n\nSeaside Park, though, did have its day in court in 2007. A federal civil court jury found two officers liable for falsifying documents and one of the two liable for using excessive force in the arrest of three tourists. The four were eventually paid $600,000 in the case.\n\nOne officer who was a defendant in the civil trial, use-of-force training director James C. Citta, remained on the force – and was later named in 11 more lawsuits involved in the town's payout of $3 million. The suits were settled without any admission of wrongdoing from the borough or Citta. Citta retired years later on a disability pension. Several efforts to reach Citta were unsuccessful.\n\nCalls to end secrecy\n\nEfforts for reforms are being made.\n\nAll police-involved deaths should be investigated by the state Attorney General’s office, not a local prosecutor’s office, Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, a Democrat from Essex County and the former speaker of the Assembly, wrote in one of her bills.\n\n“I think that the public is deserving of transparency,\" she told the Press.\n\nFamilies of victims must be assured that there isn't a coverup of \"the circumstances of the death,\" Oliver said. “I think there is great interest in doing social justice reform and criminal justice reform in this state.\"\n\nTinton Falls voters took matters into their own hands in 2017 by tossing out their mayor, a former police chief. A major issue in the campaign was once-secret police payouts.\n\nThe newly elected mayor of Tinton Falls rode the taxpayer outrage into office Nov. 7 after the Press exposed that $1.1 million was paid to settle two police whistleblower lawsuits.\n\nVito Perillo wins Tinton Falls mayoral election at age 93 Brian Johnston\n\nVito Perillo, 93, Tinton Falls’ new mayor and a World War II veteran, defeated the incumbent, who was the town’s police chief during the conduct alleged in the $1.1 million settlements. The former chief's son is a ranking officer on the police force. All government payouts should be publicly announced, Perillo said.\n\n“If it’s legal, they should do it, they should publicize it,\" he said in December about the settlements, after his election.\n\nHowever, invisibility remains the norm in many municipalities. The insurance carrier for many towns refused the Press' legal open records requests. And in court documents, many court records did not contain settlement amounts.\n\nOpen records advocate John Paff, chairman of the New Jersey Libertarian Party's Open Government Project, routinely blogs about settlements he's able to get from towns.\n\n\"What I'm hoping is it brings people to realize that maybe we need to fundamentally change the way we view things and concepts like employee privacy,\" Paff said. \"Because the taxpayer seems to be left completely out of the picture. They're just the people who are supposed to pay the bills and not ask any questions.\"\n\nOne law the Legislature and governor can pass is a requirement that all settlement agreements be publicized before they are signed by government officials.\n\n\"How are you supposed to have confidence in a system you can't see work?\" Paff said. \"It's just, 'trust us; we've got this under control. You have to trust we're investigating ourselves in secret, and you need to believe we're doing the best job for you.'\"\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen Staff photo by Andrew Ford\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, described opposition she faced from municipal officials when pursuing more open access to government.\n\n“I’ve found almost universally this apoplectic reaction if you mention the words ‘open public records’ or ‘Open Public Meetings Act,'\" she said.\n\n“Where it involves public funds, I do not believe there should be a non-disclosure agreement because this is not somebody's money from their wallet, this is from the taxpayers,\" she said.\n\nDeparting Attorney General Christopher Porrino AP file photo\n\nA judge is sometimes the final arbiter of openness. The Press has sued Neptune to force the township to release its 682-page, 20-year-long internal affairs file on Philip Seidle, the police sergeant who shot his ex-wife to death in the middle of an Asbury Park street in 2015. The township is fighting to keep the file secret, citing a state attorney general directive on confidentiality and the fear that all internal affairs records would be open to the public if the Press wins the case.\n\nDeparting Attorney General Christopher Porrino declined to comment after being presented with the Press' findings. He left office Jan. 16 when the new governor was sworn in. Gov. Phil Murphy's transition spokesman said the Press' investigation findings were shared with Murphy's attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal.\n\nFire and police\n\nFlaws in police oversight are personal for Miguel Feliz.\n\nWeeks after the encounter with Jersey City’s police, he winced as he peeled back white bandages to show the pink and red burns covering his arms.\n\nHis ordeal started on the evening of June 4 as he drove home after a day delivering groceries in Coney Island, New York.\n\nHe was listening to reggaeton. He noticed the police behind him.\n\nSuddenly Feliz's car was struck from behind by the vehicle Jersey City police were chasing. Feliz's 1999 Toyota slammed into a utility pole, power wires fell on the hood and the car caught fire.\n\nA bystander filmed on a cellphone as four officers, including MD Khan, approached, with their guns drawn.\n\n“Get down! Get down!” the officers shouted. Two kicks, clearly shown on the recording, immediately follow their commands.\n\nThe police union representative said that the officers were merely trying to stamp out the flames.\n\n\"No way. No way. There's no way. Impossible!,” Feliz told the Press. “I had to do all that myself.\"\n\nRaw video from a bystander shows police kicking Miguel Feliz after a car crash in Jersey City June 4, 2017. Andrew Ford\n\nFeliz intends to sue Jersey City for $25 million, according to a legal notice he filed with the municipality.\n\nFour Jersey City officers were indicted following the incident, including two charged with assaulting Feliz. They have pled not guilty and remain on the force, suspended without pay – except for MD Khan.\n\nJersey City records show that Khan's termination had nothing to do with Feliz.\n\nKhan, a four-year veteran, was fired over money cheated from the city and his disciplinary record.\n\nMore:Know your rights\n\nA vendor paid Khan $232 for off-duty police work. The city said that was a violation of its rules, which require all payments to go through the city. Khan's attorney declined to comment.\n\nIn the transaction, the city would have taken a $32 administrative fee.\n\nIs Khan an aberration among officers? Feliz thinks so.\n\n\"There's good officers out there,\" Feliz said. \"There really are. Just that some are not.\"\n\nThe Asbury Park Press wants to hear from you.

Tyre D. Nichols of Memphis died three days after the traffic stop.\n\n\"Earlier today, each officer charged was terminated from the Memphis Police Department,\" a written statement from Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn \"CJ\" Davis said. \"The egregious nature of this incident is not a reflection of the good work that our officers perform with integrity, every day.\"\n\nThe charges mentioned by Davis are internal, department charges, not criminal ones.\n\nOfficers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr., and Justin Smith were all fired Friday evening. They had been with the department since Aug. 2020, Aug. 2020, March 2018, March 2017, and March 2018, respectively.\n\nThe officers' release followed a nearly two-week long internal investigation into possible policy violations that occurred during the traffic stop.\n\nFederal officials:Civil rights investigation opened in death of Tennessee man who died after police traffic stop\n\nMore:Memphis will release footage of incident related to Tyre Nichols' death, officials say\n\n\"To see their faces makes me angry,\" said Keyana Dixon, Nichols' older sister. \"I'm trying to hold it together, but my heart has been ripped open. This is torture.\"\n\nJamal Dupree, one of Nichols' older brothers, and Angelina Paxton, one of Nichols' long-time friends, said they both feel let down by the officers involved.\n\n\"Knowing the history of police interactions with the Black community throughout time, these men took a position of power and instead of doing something to better the future and honor the past, they became no better than the days of Emmett Till,\" Dupree and Paxton said in a joint statement. \"They have let us all down. Justice will be served to them.\"\n\nNichols died Jan. 10, three days after he was pulled over in a traffic stop.\n\nVoices:Police kill far too many people during traffic stops. We must change why stops are made.\n\nThe traffic stop, Nichols' hospitalization\n\nAccording to a statement from the Memphis Police Department, officers pulled Nichols over around 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 7 and a \"confrontation\" ensued. Nichols eventually ran away, but was later arrested. Officers said another \"confrontation\" happened at that point, but he had already been detained.\n\nIt was after this that police say Nichols \"complained of a shortness of breath,\" and was taken to St. Francis Hospital in critical condition.\n\nAn image of Nichols shared with the public shortly after his death showed an intubated Nichols. His face was disfigured from a combination of significant welts. His nose was nearly bent into an “s” shape. Blood was seen on his intubation tube and on his hospital sheets.\n\nThis week:Tennessee driver's death after arrest sparks community protest, calls for state investigation\n\nFamily members of Nichols said he suffered a number of injuries, including kidney failure and brain swelling. He was hooked up to a dialysis machine prior to his death, Rodney Wells, Nichols' step father, said.\n\nInvestigations into Nichols' death\n\nThe officers involved were placed on leave and the internal investigation was opened by the city and police department. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was immediately called in to investigate the officers' \"use of force\" in the stop by the Shelby County District Attorney's Office.\n\nA federal investigation would be announced just over a week after Nichols' Jan. 10 death, with the United States Attorney's Office, FBI Memphis Field Office and Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division saying an investigation into possible civil rights violations by the officers was underway.\n\nThis week in politics:US hits debt ceiling; Biden has 'no regrets' for delay in telling public of documents\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The original announcement that the footage would be released publicly came just minutes before a memorial service for Nichols.\n\nFamily has also demanded that all officers involved be charged with \"murder one,\" Wells said at the memorial service.\n\nNichols was remembered by friends and family as someone who would \"light up the room\" when he walked in.

Parish, who has represented the constituency since 2010, said it had been a “moment of madness”.\n\nNHS worker Simon Lightwood will be Labour’s candidate for the Wakefield by-election. The BBC said the seat is regarded as a “key target for Labour” who had held it for more than 80 years before the Conservatives won it in 2019.\n\nThe selection of Lightwood did not come without controversy. The executive committee of the Wakefield Labour Party walked out of the final selection meeting, said The Telegraph, claiming that Lightwood was “parachuted in” by Starmer’s office. Ed Balls had also been linked with the seat but later said he had “no intention” of standing.\n\nLord David Frost, the former Brexit minister, had been rumoured by The Spectator to be a contender for the Conservative candidacy. However, Nadeem Ahmed, a Conservative councillor for Wakefield South and leader of the Wakefield Conservative group from 2014 to 2021, was eventually chosen.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats selected Jamie Needle as their candidate.

During Labour’s long run holding the constituency, the second-placed party was always the Conservatives.\n\nSince its creation in 1997, Tiverton and Honiton has always returned a Conservative MP. The area served by the constituency has not been represented by a party other than the Conservatives since 1923.\n\nSignificance and predictions\n\nThe two by-elections, taking place at either end of the country, “provide a dry run for the next British general election”, said The Economist.\n\nIn Wakefield, the Conservatives must show they “can hang onto the traditionally Labour-voting areas which they won in 2019”, while in Tiverton and Honiton they must “stave off a resurgent Liberal Democrat party” that has begun to “take chunks” out of their rural base.\n\nA poll from Survation on behalf of campaigning platform 38 Degrees at the start of the month put Labour 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in Wakefield. However, internal polling seen by The Sunday Times last weekend put the lead at a “less than convincing” eight points.\n\nWhile the Tories won Wakefield with just a 3,358 majority in 2019, they secured Tiverton with 24,239 votes more than Labour. Internal polling from the Lib Dems, who came in third place, suggests the party is now “neck and neck with the Conservatives” in the Devon seat, said the i news site.\n\nMost of the bookmakers agree that the Lib Dems will win, while Labour will take Wakefield.\n\nVoters in the two by-election constituencies are in a “privileged position” as they have the “opportunity to speak for the country”, said The Observer on Sunday. “A double whammy of byelection defeats will frighten Conservative MPs in red wall seats and those traditionally true blue.”\n\nYes, by-elections offer voters “a chance to protest against the government”, said Will Dunn at The New Statesman. But he warned that by “making this by-election all about Johnson and his leadership” the opposition parties also risk playing into the prime minister’s hands.\n\n“A Tory victory in the present circumstances could be spun as a kind of personal vindication,” said Dunn. And, more fundamentally, “when every vote is an act of applause or revenge, good policy and competent government become irrelevant, and populism always wins”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954784/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-shropshire-by-election", "title": "North Shropshire by-election: who could win Owen Paterson's seat ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

The Liberal Democrat leader claimed that “lifelong Conservative voters” were switching their votes to the Liberal Democrats because they are “tired of being taken for granted by Boris Johnson”, reported The Independent.\n\nAnd the Conservative candidate Neil Shastri-Hurst tried to quell suggestions that recent headlines over sleaze allegations, Downing Street Christmas parties and tougher Covid measures were making an impact on doorsteps.\n\nThe Conservative hopeful, a barrister and former doctor, told The Times that locals were “predominantly” concerned with local issues such as ambulance response times and rural broadband speeds, but conceded that there was “a real mix” of reactions to Boris Johnson after a difficult two weeks for the prime minister.\n\nThe candidates\n\nNeil Shastri-Hurst, Conservatives\n\nThe candidate representing the Tory party is Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst. According to his profile on the website of law firm Kings Chambers, Shastri-Hurst is qualified in medicine and law, and “spent a number of years” as a medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps.\n\nBen Wood, Labour\n\nLabour put forward Ben Wood, from Oswestry in Shropshire, as its candidate. Wood began his “working life in a local hardware shop”, according to the BBC, and has promised to put forward “a new plan with fresh ideas” for the constituency.\n\nHelen Morgan, Liberal Democrats\n\nMorgan stood for the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 election and is a chartered accountant who lives in Harmer Hill, Shropshire.\n\nDuncan Kerr, Green Party\n\nA member of Shropshire Council, Kerr stood for the Green Party in both the 2015 and 2017 general elections.\n\nKirsty Walmsley, Reform UK\n\nThe first hopeful to officially declare their candidacy in the contest was Kirsty Walmsley, who is standing for Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party.\n\nWalmsley “became the UK’s youngest councillor when she was elected onto the now-defunct Oswestry Borough Council at the age of 21”, said the Shropshire Star. She has since “worked in Parliament as a caseworker for three MPs”. Walmsley has said that she would not have challenged Paterson, as he is a “man of integrity”.\n\nAndrea Allen, UKIP\n\nA UKIP parish councillor and chair of Whitchurch Town Twinning Association, Allen is a former modern languages teacher.\n\nRussell Dean, The Party Party\n\nRussell Dean – not to be confused with the Tory MP Dean Russell – currently lives in Monaco but has vowed to relocate back to the UK if elected.\n\nThe 55-year old yacht brokerage consultant is standing on a platform of “anti-sleaze and corruption” and has said that his party’s unusual name is intended to help achieve his goal of “attracting young people into politics and encouraging them to engage”, the Shropshire Star reported.\n\nMartin Daubney, The Reclaim Party\n\nMartin Daubney represented the West Midlands in the European Parliament between 2019 and 2020 while a member of the Brexit Party.\n\nVictory hopes\n\nLiberal Democrat internal polling, seen by Politico, suggests that the party is now “neck and neck” with the Conservatives, with one source “claiming the Tory vote has collapsed”, setting the scene for a “Shropshire earthquake” come polling day.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Labour have been “marshalling their forces to maximise damage to the ruling Conservatives” in what appears to be an unofficial informal pact between the two parties, said the Financial Times.\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat sources have begun whispering about the possibility of an upset, with one source telling Politico that “there is a real prospect” the Tories could lose the seat in a further blow to Boris Johnson’s credibility.\n\nThe party’s canvassers are “urging Labour supporters to vote Lib Dem tactically to defeat the Tory candidate”, the site added, with Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi getting in on the act when she told Times Radio: “Let’s face it, Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so.”\n\n“The conclusion that the Lib Dems are now favourites is shared by Tory MPs who have visited the seat”, Politico said, with one stating their belief that their party is set to lose.\n\nLib Dem candidate Morgan told The Times that her “sense is that turnout won’t be that great and that there are quite a lot of demotivated Conservatives”, adding: “Local people really do think they want somebody who is embedded in their community.\n\nNew contenders Reform UK, led by Richard Tice, formerly of the Brexit Party, split the vote in Old Bexley and Sidcup earlier this month, suggested The Telegraph,\n\nand Conservative MPs have told the paper that “the vibes coming back” from North Shropshire are “not good”.\n\nCould it be that the Conservatives are “facing a new Ukip, and an ensuing return to the electoral agonies of a split on the right?”, asked Mark Wallace on the i news site.\n\n“Tice is now confidently predicting that he will cause further trouble for Johnson in North Shropshire next week”, said Wallace, and it’s not hard to see why Conservatives might be watching the slow surge of support for the Reform Party with “furrowed brow”.\n\n“Not long ago, a surging Ukip regularly scored double figures in by-elections. Nigel Farage only gained one seat, but he secured enough of the vote to help Labour and Lib Dem candidates cling on in dozens of close contests.”\n\nThe Conservative campaign may also be further hampered by the defection of two North Shropshire councillors to different parties just days before the by-election, reported the BBC.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Market Drayton, Mark Whittle, said he defected to Reform UK because he could not back a Conservative candidate who was not local.\n\nConservative pick Neil Shastri-Hurst comes from Birmingham but has promised his home will be “here in North Shropshire” should he be elected.\n\nWhittle described his defection as “the most difficult decision I have ever made\" and said it had come after “a great deal of soul searching”.\n\n“I’m faced with no choice… how can I possibly back a candidate from Birmingham who has zero knowledge of North Shropshire and the challenges our community faces,” he said. “The Conservatives should have selected locally rather than be pressured into supporting someone with no prior interest or knowledge of the area.”\n\nFormer Tory councillor Anthony Allen has defected to Reclaim, founded by actor Laurence Fox last year, becoming the party’s first elected official.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/955131/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-12-december-2021", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 12 December 2021 | The ...", "text": "Sign up to our 10 Things You Need to Know Today newsletter A free daily digest of the biggest news stories of the day - and the best features from our website Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to TheWeek.

PM ‘broke rules at Xmas quiz’\n\nBoris Johnson has been accused of breaking Covid laws by hosting a Christmas quiz in No10 last year. The Sunday Mirror pictured the PM reading out the questions. According to a source, many staff huddled by computers, conferring on questions and knocking back drinks from a local Tesco Metro. The insider said that in one office there were 24 people. London was then under regulations banning any social mixing between households. Downing Street said the PM “briefly took part virtually in a quiz”.\n\n2. Omicron ‘could kill 75,000 by April’\n\nThe Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 to 75,000 deaths by the end of April, according to a new study. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the UK will face a substantial wave of Omicron infections without further restrictions beyond Plan B. However, senior ministers are pledging to “resist” any attempt to usher in a “Plan C” of further Covid restrictions.\n\n3. Lib Dems ‘neck and neck’ for by election\n\nThe Liberal Democrats believe they are “neck and neck” with the Tories in the run-up to the North Shropshire by-election. The constituency will vote on Thursday for a new MP to replace Owen Paterson, who resigned his seat after the scandal over his second job. The Lib Dems say that internal canvassing shows support for the Tories collapsing in the aftermath of sleaze allegations. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey is making his fifth visit of the campaign this weekend.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nOsorbo, who rapped in parts of the song, shared two Latin Grammys that “Patria y Vida” won in 2021.\n\nThe Cuban government so far has not commented on the trials, but previously said both men are agents of the United States, paid to disrupt the social order on the communist-run island.\n\nPer activists, Otero Alcantara faces charges of defamation of public institutions and national symbols, contempt and public disorder while Osorbo is being tried for disrespect and resisting authority.\n\nBoth men have said they are being unjustly persecuted for attempting to peacefully protest against government censorship.\n\nIn an audio message that activist Claudia Genlui distributed on social media purportedly of Otero Alcantara speaking from prison, the artist says Cuban officials have told him he will not face prison time if he chooses to go into exile.\n\n“In the country I dream of,” Otero Alcantara said in the audio message, “the children of Cuba will not have to emigrate and will be able to fulfill their goals on the island or return whenever they wish.”\n\nOsorbo was arrested in May 2021 following several confrontations with police and, according to activists, faces up to ten years in prison.\n\nOtero Alcantara was arrested in July 2021 during widespread protests across Cuba where thousands took to the streets decrying the lack of food, medicines and civil liberties.\n\nCuba blamed the US government for creating the unrest.\n\nAccording to activists, Otero Alcantara faces up to seven years in prison.\n\nOn Monday there was a heavy police presence outside the court where activists said the men were going on trial.\n\nPolice manning barricades blocked the street outside the court, preventing international journalists and diplomats from several European countries from reaching the building.\n\nTrying the men could create greater dissent among Cubans.\n\nAfter Otero Alcantara was detained following a hunger strike in 2020, hundreds of artists and students staged a sit-in at the Ministry of Culture.

One year on ...", "text": "San Jose de las Lajas, Cuba CNN —\n\nThe largest anti-government protests to take place in Cuba since the 1959 revolution started with a blackout on a boiling hot summer day. After days of power cuts by the government, residents in the small city of San Antonio de los Baños ran out of patience. On July 11, 2021, they took to the streets to complain.\n\nThe episode might have remained as a Cuban urban legend, a whispered about moment of rare public dissent on the communist-run island, if not for recent upgrades to the island’s mobile internet.\n\nBut that summer, Cubans across the nation were able to live stream and view in real time the unfolding protests in San Antonio de los Baños – and join in. Almost immediately across the island, thousands of other Cubans took to the streets, some complaining about the lack of food and medicines, others denouncing high-ranking officials and calling for greater civil liberties.\n\nThe unprecedented demonstrations even spread to small cities and towns where there are more horse and carriages on the potholed-streets than automobiles.\n\nMarta and Jorge Perdomo stand in front of a sign on their home in San Jose de las Lajas, Cuba, on June 28, 2022. Patrick Oppmann/CNN\n\nIn the city of San Jose de las Lajas, Marta Perdomo said her two sons Nadir and Jorge, both teachers, immediately joined protests as soon as news arrived of unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\n“My sons went out because like every Cuban they were desperate over the situation,” Marta Perdomo told CNN. “They are fathers. Every day here we have less. There was no medicine. It was a very sad moment with the pandemic. Children were dying and the elderly too.”\n\nAnger boiled over for Cubans as shortages of food and medicine – already a regular occurrence in Cuba – became increasingly dire. After years of government neglect, the creaky power grids were breaking down more and more often. While Cuban officials have long blamed US sanctions for the island’s woes, protestors on July 11 raged squarely against their own government for their worsening living conditions.\n\nVideo Marta’s son Nadir took that day shows crowds of anti-government protestors marching peacefully down the street, the demonstrators themselves seemingly in shock over what was happening.\n\n“This is authentic! It’s spontaneous!” Nadir says excitedly in the video.\n\nAccording to Perdomo, protestors in San Jose de las Lajas did not sack government-run stores selling items in hard currency or flip over police cars, unlike in other cities.\n\nAs more and more Cubans took to the streets, it became clear that the Cuban government was facing the largest internal challenge to its hold on power in decades.\n\nIn a speech on state-run TV, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel blamed the island’s economic problems on US government sanctions, said the protests were the result of a subversion campaign directed from abroad, and called the loyal to take back the streets from protestors.\n\n“We are convoking all the country’s revolutionaries, all the communists, to go into the streets, to all the places where they might replicate these provocations,” he said. “The order to combat has been given.”\n\nGovernment supporters carrying bats alongside police began to break up the protests. Hundreds of Cubans were arrested; some for clashing with officials, others for merely filming the turmoil with their phones.\n\nAs protests in San Jose de las Lajas were disrupted by government supporters and police, Nadir and Jorge Perdomo returned to their house and filmed a video on their phones that they were able to post online despite the government’s attempts to cut internet access on the island.\n\n“No one paid us,” Nadir says in the video, rebuffing government claims that the protests had been contrived.\n\n“We are just reacting the way all the people did.”\n\nBoth brothers were arrested days later and charged with alleged crimes including public disorder, assault and contempt. Their mother Marta said the charges against her sons were fabricated and that they were being punished for peacefully speaking out against the government.\n\nCuban officials say that many of the protestors arrested were delinquents and “counter revolutionaries.” But in their court records, prosecutors note that neither Nadir or Jorge had criminal records and both “were well regarded” in their community. In February, Nadir were found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison and Jorge to eight years.\n\nTo date, Cuban prosecutors say they have convicted and sentenced close to 500 people in relation to the protests, in the largest mass trials on the island in decades.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wife of arrested Cuban protester: All they asked for was liberty 03:12 - Source: CNN\n\nPreventing future protests\n\nBut international human rights organizations say the Cuban government is using the prosecutions to intimidate Cubans from daring to protest again.\n\n“We found that prosecutors were constantly charging Cubans for exercising their basic rights such as the right to protest peacefully, the right to insult their president or the right to insult police officers, exercising the right of freedom of expression,” said Juan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nOn Monday, HRW released a report on the protests that it says documents 155 cases of alleged abuse against people involved in last year’s demonstrations, “including harassment, arbitrary detention, abuse-ridden prosecutions, beatings, and other cases of ill-treatment that in some cases constitute torture.”\n\nThe organization also accused the Cuban government of further cracking down on civil liberties to prevent more protests from taking place.\n\nMarta Perdomo said she encountered the tightening restrictions first-hand after she was invited to Europe in June to speak about her sons to human rights groups and lawmakers. When she reached the airport in Havana, officials there told her and another mother of an imprisoned protestor they would not be permitted to travel.\n\n“They said I was ‘regulated’ and couldn’t go,” Perdomo said.\n\nCuban officials did not respond to a CNN request asking why Marta Perdomo was not allowed to leave the island.\n\nEven though Perdomo says she is worried about when her three young grandchildren will see their fathers again, she does not have regrets.\n\n“They didn’t have to go out but they felt the pain of Cuba,” Perdomo said. “That’s why they went out. That day my sons were free.”\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the July protests will be remembered as rare outburst of public rage or a new stage in the struggle for greater openness.\n\nAs the pandemic, US sanctions and the slow pace of reforms continue to batter the Cuban economy, officials on the island seem to realize that despite their heavy-handed crackdown last year, more protests could happen at any time.\n\nIn June this year, hundreds of Cuban students at a university in the city of Camagüey began a nighttime demonstration after power was cut in their dormitory.\n\n“F**k these blackouts! Put the electricity on!” they chanted as they banged on pots as seen on videos that the students uploaded to social media.\n\nCuban officials quickly turned back on the lights.", "authors": ["Patrick Oppmann"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/12/india/india-comedians-crackdown-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "In India, comedians can face arrest for making the wrong kind of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis time last year Nalin Yadav was detained in an Indian prison, not knowing when he would be let out.\n\n“I didn’t understand how or why this happened to me,” said the 26-year-old stand-up comedian, who spent almost two months behind bars. “I couldn’t sleep or eat. I had anxiety attacks. My mind wouldn’t stop racing.”\n\nHis alleged crime? Organizing and opening a show for a comic he says he had met just five minutes earlier – a Muslim comedian accused of telling jokes that insulted the Hindu faith.\n\nHe and four others have pleaded not guilty over allegedly hurting and outraging religious sentiment during a comedy show last January.

I never expected what would happened next.”\n\nMunawar Faruqui during a performance.

The complaint also said that Faruqui told a joke about BJP Home Minister Amit Shah, but no further details were given.\n\nIt’s unclear when Faruqui allegedly told the jokes.\n\nIn his complaint, Gaur alleges Faruqui said it during his performance, while two of his friends said he told the jokes before his performance began.\n\nThese jokes “hurt and outraged” Gaur’s religious sentiment, the documents said.\n\nYadav and four others, including Faruqui, were arrested early the next morning on charges including “uttering words with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings” and “deliberate and malicious intention of outraging religious feelings,” as well as breaking some Covid-19 social distancing rules, court documents show. Breaking Covid rules carries a possible maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine.\n\nCNN contacted Faruqui’s representatives, but they declined to comment.\n\nDetails of Eklavya Gaud’s police complaint\n\nSource: High Court of Madhya Pradesh\n\nAfter multiple court hearings, Faruqui was released on bail by India’s top court on February 5 after spending 35 days in jail, with the court saying police hadn’t followed proper procedure when arresting him.\n\nBut Yadav remained in prison until February 26 when the Madhya Pradesh High Court finally granted his release on bail – after 57 days in prison.\n\nYadav said his 17-year-old brother paid his bail fees, $1,330, from the money he had saved for his university education – money that they had inherited after their mother died.\n\n“My brother couldn’t go to university,” said Yadav. “He sacrificed so much for me. How can I even look him in the eye?”\n\nLawyer Anshumaan Shrivastava, who represents Yadav and Faruqui, said the comedians didn’t break the law – and he pointed out that the Indian constitution guarantees freedom of expression.\n\nCNN contacted the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Law and Justice but did not receive a response.\n\nA free speech crackdown\n\nIt’s not just Yadav and Faruqui who have been on the receiving end of legal action.\n\nSeveral other comedians have angered the country’s ruling politicians. And while in other countries that might be the end of it, in India, some people have pursued the matter with police.\n\nIn November last year, Hindu comedian Vir Das’ powerful monologue addressing India’s rape crisis and the year-long farmers’ protests against agricultural laws polarized the country.\n\nVir Das attends 49th International Emmy Awards on November 22, 2021 in New York City. Arturo Holmes/Getty Images\n\nRight-wing activists called for his arrest, while supporters rallied to his defense.\n\nAshutosh Dubey, a legal adviser to the BJP, accused Das of “defaming” India and filed a complaint with the Mumbai police over Das’ “inflammatory” comments, according to a post he wrote on Twitter.\n\nDas has not been formally charged with any crime and continues to perform. He defended his monologue, writing on Twitter the video was “satire about the duality of two very separate India’s (sic).”\n\n“Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret,” he said. “I take pride in my country, and I carry that pride across the world.”\n\nIn December 2020, the Supreme Court held comedian Kunal Kamra in contempt of court for allegedly disparaging the judiciary and judges in his social media posts. In one Twitter post, he criticized the court’s handling of a case involving a right-wing commentator. If found guilty, Kamra faces up to six months in prison and a fine.\n\nKamra told CNN he has canceled about 100 shows over the past eight years because of threats by right-wing groups to the venue and audience – and it’s getting worse, he said. India is mostly a right-wing and “humorless society,” he said.\n\nKunal Kamra performs during a show in India.

But up-and-coming Muslim comedian Parvez Hassan says the country has become more intolerant since Modi’s BJP came to power in 2014.\n\n“It feels like we are going backwards in society,” he said. “There are now fears (among some comedians) of putting content on YouTube, of telling a certain joke in public.”\n\nAnd the issue goes well beyond comedians. Yadav and Faruqui were charged under a colonial-era law which criminalizes hurting “religious sentiment.” Experts say Modi’s government is using another piece of colonial-era legislation – the country’s sedition law – to silence activists, journalists and other critics.\n\nComedian Parvez Hassan during a show.

In 2020, the most recent data available, that number had increased to 73.\n\nIndira Jaising, an Indian human rights lawyer, said laws have been weaponized in India against anyone who disagrees with the government.\n\n“When a society cannot tolerate satire, it’s a society that has lost its constitutional values,” she said, adding the comedians’ case “goes well beyond freedom of speech” and calling it an “infringement” on their right to earn a living.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to inaugurate the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, in Varanasi on December 13, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn January, Rohinton Nariman, a former judge of India’s Supreme Court, also hit out at how sedition laws are being used. He said young people, students and stand-up comedians were being booked for criticizing the government, while others were getting away with calling for genocide against Muslims.\n\nHe was referring to comments made during a three-day event in the city of Haridwar in December when right-wing Hindus called on their followers to kill Muslims.\n\n“We find great reluctance from some of the authorities to book these people,” Nariman said.\n\nThe future\n\nSince his arrest last year, Yadav says his career – and life – has unraveled.\n\nBefore the arrest, Yadav was able to make ends meet by performing. But after he was released on bail, he said no one wanted to book him as they feared violence from right-wing groups. Right-wing vigilantes harassed him on the streets, and he could only find work as a laborer, earning a daily wage of $2.60, he said.\n\nYadav said he hoped that when he was freed from prison, people would see he had been treated unfairly.\n\n“But all my hope faded. I always saw the best in society … but I finally saw the real world.”\n\nFaruqui also took a brief hiatus from comedy after threats were made to his performance venues and audience.\n\n“Hate has won,” he said on Twitter in November. “The artist has lost.”\n\nHe has since returned to the stage.\n\n“Every law has been weaponized in India. They are being used against anyone who disagrees with the government.”Indira Jaising\n\nThe arrest of comedians is also affecting others in the industry.\n\nSome venues and organizers are canceling shows for fear of backlash and violence.\n\nThe LVC Comedy Club in the southern state of Goa canceled Faruqui’s performance in November after a right-wing group threatened to destroy the venue.\n\nA spokesperson for the club, who did not want to be named for security reasons, said the comedy scene in India was becoming “more hostile.”\n\n“We are not political and don’t endorse everything comedians say,” the spokesperson said. “We are free speech advocates and support the right to joke about anything.”\n\n“(But) in a country that reports 77 rapes per day, I’m baffled that jokes are where people choose to be offended.”\n\nIn November, Yadav decided to leave Indore to start his comedy career afresh in India’s capital Delhi.\n\n“It is ironic that comedy – the one thing that kept me alive and gave me hope – was the same thing that took everything from me,” Yadav said.\n\n“But I don’t blame comedy. I will never blame comedy. I blame the system, the government and the state of our society.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/china/hong-kong-speech-therapists-childrens-books-sedition-conviction-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Five Hong Kong speech therapists convicted of sedition over ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nFive speech therapists in Hong Kong were found guilty of a conspiracy to publish seditious children’s books on Wednesday, in a case that rights defenders say marks a major blow to free speech amid a tightening of civil liberties in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe charges center around a set of picture books telling the stories of a village of sheep resisting a pack of wolves invading their home – a storyline that the government prosecutors alleged was meant to provoke contempt of the local government and China’s central government in Beijing.\n\nIn one book, the wolves tried to takeover a village and eat the sheep, in another, 12 sheep are forced to leave their village after being targeted by the wolves, which the court believed alluded to the case where 12 Hong Kong activists attempted to flee the city to Taiwan as fugitives, but were intercepted by Chinese law enforcement.\n\nIn a ruling Wednesday, a Hong Kong District Court judge sided with the prosecution, expressing his view that the images had a correlation to events in city, and finding that the authors had the intention to “bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection” against the local and central government, or both.\n\n“By identifying (the People’s Republic of China) government as the wolves … the children will be led into belief that (the PRC government) is coming to Hong Kong with the wicked intention of taking away their home and ruining their happy life with no right to do so at all,” the judge Kwok Wai Kin wrote in a 67-page document outlining his thinking on the verdict.\n\n“The publishers of the books clearly refuse to recognize that (China) has resumed exercising sovereignty over (Hong Kong),” Kwok wrote in his decision, referring to the transfer of Hong Kong, a former British colony, to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nThe case has become a proxy for looming questions about the limits of freedom of expression in the city, coming amid a larger crackdown on civil liberties as part of Beijing’s response to wide-scale, months-long anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nThose protests, which were sparked in response to a proposed bill which could send Hong Kongers to be tried for crimes across the border, transformed in to a larger pro-democracy movement that was also linked to popular concern about Beijing’s growing influence in the semi-autonomous city.\n\nThe defense for the accused, who were all executive council members of the now defunct General Union of the Hong Kong Speech Therapists, had argued that the charges leveled against them were unconstitutional, given that they were inconsistent with their freedoms of expression protected under Hong Kong law.\n\nBut Kwok, who is also one of a small cohort of judges hand-picked by the city’s leader to hear cases related to national security, struck down that challenge, saying instead that limited restrictions on freedom of expression were necessary for the protection of national security and public order.\n\nIn a document outlining reasons for the guilty verdict, Kwok disputed that the books were merely fables promoting universal values, another argument raised by the defense, pointing to a foreword in one of the books that references an “anti-legislation movement” in 2019 and the “One Country, Two Systems” mechanism governing Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland.\n\nA sentencing is to follow on Saturday, according to public broadcaster RTHK, which could see the defendants – who have been denied bail since their arrests in July, 2021 – handed up to two years in prison. Lorie Lai, Melody Yeung, Sidney Ng, Samuel Chan and Marco Fong, ages 25 to 28, had all plead not guilty.\n\nThe case was thrown into the public eye following their arrest, when police accused the group in a Tweet of “sugarcoating protesters’ unlawful acts” and “glorifying fugitives fleeing,” with officials raising specific concerns given that the target audience was children. Beijing and local leaders have sought to encourage national pride among Hong Kong youth, including by bolstering national education in local curricula.\n\nThe verdict has been met with outcry from rights defenders. Human Rights Watch in a statement accused the Hong Kong government of using the “very broad” sedition law “to penalize minor speech offenses.”\n\n“Hong Kong people used to read about the absurd prosecution of people in mainland China for writing political allegories, but this is now happening in Hong Kong,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in a statement. “Hong Kong authorities should reverse this dramatic decline in freedoms and quash the convictions of the five children’s book authors.”\n\nIn July, the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee also called on Hong Kong to repeal its colonial-era sedition law, saying it was concerned about its use to limit citizens’ “legitimate right to freedom of speech.”\n\nIn a reply, the government said use of the law was “not meant to silence expression of any opinion that is only genuine criticism against the government based on objective facts.”\n\nThe law, part of a 1938 Crimes Ordinance unused for decades, has been revived alongside Beijing’s introduction of a National Security Law to Hong Kong in 2020, which targets secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist activities – with a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nLast year a court ruled that parts of the original sedition law which referenced the monarch could be converted to mean references to the central government or the Hong Kong government. A conviction carries a maximum two-year sentence.\n\nOther recent cases have included the sentencing of a 75-year-old activist to nine months in jail for planning to protest against the Beijing Winter Olympics earlier this year.

But the nationwide blackouts were caused by the storm and were not planned.\n\nThe storm exacerbated an economic crisis that has been gripping Cuba, leading to shortages of food, fuel and medicine. Blackouts across the island were regular all summer, which led to rare scattered protests against the government. Those protests picked up after the hurricane made life harder for Cubans already struggling.\n\nOften at night, protestors in cities and towns have banged on pots and pans, angry at government power cuts. Some protestors have called for electrical service to be restored while others have demanded that Cuban leaders step down.\n\nThe recent protests have not reached the scale as those of July 2021, when thousands of Cubans took to the streets demanding change, in the largest anti-government demonstrations since the 1959 revolution.\n\nAfter days of power cuts by the government last year, residents in the small city of San Antonio de los Baños ran out of patience. On July 11, 2021, they took to the streets in a moment of rare public dissent on the island.\n\nCubans across the nation were able to live stream and view in real time the unfolding protests in San Antonio de los Baños – and join in.\n\nAlmost immediately thousands of other Cubans were demonstrating. Some complained the lack of food and medicines, others denounced high-ranking officials and called for greater civil liberties. The unprecedented protests spread to small cities and towns.\n\nWhile Cuban officials have long blamed US sanctions for the island’s woes, protestors during the summer of 2021 raged squarely against their own government for their worsening living conditions.\n\nIn a speech on state-run TV, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel blamed the island’s economic problems on US sanctions, said the protests were the result of a subversion campaign directed from abroad and called on Cubans loyal to the revolution to take back the streets.

They have pleaded not guilty to the charge of seditious conspiracy, a charge rarely brought by the Justice Department, and other charges.\n\nThe Justice Department’s opening statement featured messages and other communications among the defendants that prosecutors say show the Oath Keepers’ unlawful plotting to disrupt Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s electoral win. As the prosecutors sought to use the words of the defendants against them, they also played video capturing the Oath Keepers’ actions in the Capitol and displayed maps and charts to help the jury follow along. Each juror has their own screen to see evidence.\n\n“They said out loud and in writing what they planned to do,” Jeffrey Nestler, an assistant US Attorney, told the jury. “When the opportunity finally presented itself … they sprang into action.”\n\nA lawyer for Rhodes, the first defense attorney to deliver an opening statement told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that the defendants “had no part in the bulk” of the violence that occurred on January 6.\n\n“You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did,” attorney Phillip Linder said, “but the evidence will show that they didn’t do anything illegal that day.”\n\nHere are takeaways from Monday’s trial so far:\n\nDOJ says defendants “concocted a plan for an armed rebellion”\n\nThe Justice Department began its opening statement with the accusation that the defendants sought to “stop by any means necessary” the lawful transfer of presidential power, “including taking up arms against the United States government.”\n\nNestler started with a reference to the “core democratic custom of the routine” transfer of power, which Nestler said stretched back to the time of George Washington.\n\n“These defendants tried to change that history. They concocted a plan for armed rebellion to shatter a bedrock of American democracy,” Nestler said.\n\nThe defendants got their opportunity two weeks before the Inauguration, Nestler said.\n\n“If Congress could not meet it could not declare the winner of the election. and that was their goal – to stop by any means necessary the lawful transfer of power, including taking up arms against the United States government,” he said.\n\nHe said the defendants descended on DC to attack “not just the Capitol, not just our government, not just DC, but our country itself.”\n\nDuring the Justice Department’s opening, the jury was presented with video footage, maps and other audio-visual tools that prosecutors used to give an overview of their case.\n\nNestler’s presentation included iPhone footage from the attack that the prosecutor used to identify the defendants and other alleged co-conspirators. When video showing defendant Kelly Meggs was presented, Nestler noted the patch he wore, which said, according to Nestler: “I don’t believe in anything, I’m just here for the violence.”\n\nAs the video clips played, the jury also saw a map of the Capitol that Nestler used to situate the action that was recorded by video. Nestler also had a physical chart, perched on an easel in the courtroom, listing out the alleged co-conspirators.\n\nJurors were also presented with the messages that the defendants allegedly sent in the weeks after the election, including their calls for a violent response to former President Donald Trump’s loss.\n\n“Its easy to chat here. The real question is who’s willing to DIE” Meggs wrote in one message shown by prosecutors.\n\nThe DOJ also showed video and photographs of the Oath Keepers participating in tactical training sessions. A map of the Washington Mall – showing the site of the rally that preceded the Capitol attack and its distance from the Capitol – was presented while Nestler ticked through communications, including on the walkie talk app Zello, between the defendants that allegedly occurred that day.\n\nProsecutors preemptively punch holes in Oath Keepers’ defense\n\nNestler used the opening arguments to also preview how the Justice Department will respond to defenses the Oath Keepers’ attorneys are expected to put forward.\n\n“There is evidence that you will hear that they had more than one reason to be here in DC, in addition to attacking Congress,” the prosecutor said. The defendants may have been planning to attend the rally near the White House earlier in the day, Nestler noted, but so did thousands of others. Nestler also referenced to potential attempts by the defense to argue the Oath Keepers were preparing to come to DC to serve as security, noting that the defendants weren’t licensed, trained or paid for their security work.\n\n“Even being bad security guards isn’t itself illegal.” Nestler said. However, according to the prosecutor, the goal they were actually preparing for was “unlawful.”\n\nAdditionally, Nestler alluded to the belief that Trump was going to invoke the Insurrection Act; the defense has signaled it plans to argue that the Oath Keepers were preparing to respond to such an invocation.\n\n“President Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act,” Nestler said. “These defendants needed to take matters into their own hands. They needed to activate the plan they had agreed on.”\n\nThe Justice Department also emphasized the backgrounds of some of the defendants and how that fit into the department’s theory of the case. Rhodes, as Nestler repeatedly noted, is a graduate of Yale Law school. He knew to be careful with his words and told his co-conspirators to be careful with theirs, Nestler said.\n\nThomas Caldwell, another defendant, served in the military, Nestler said. “Based on that water experience, he planned to use boats to get across the Potomac.”\n\nDOJ detail “desperate” focus on January 6\n\nThe Justice Department detailed the preparations the Oath Keepers allegedly undertook before January 6 as well as what they’re accusing the defendants of doing during the Capitol breach.\n\nIn December 2020, Rhodes told others that January 6 presented a “hard constitutional deadline,” according to prosecutors, and that they would need to “do it ourselves” if Trump didn’t stop the certification of the election.\n\n“With time, as their options dwindled and it became more and more likely that power would be transferred,” Nestler said Monday, “these defendants became more and more desperate and more and more focused on that date that Rhodes referred to as a constitutional deadline.”\n\nAccording to Nestler, the group organized a caravan of Florida members to drive up to Washington for January 6, and made preparations for where the organization could store firearms in Virginia, just outside DC. Some members of the group, according to prosecutors, brought weapons into DC that day, including chemical spray, thick pieces of wood, dressed in paramilitary gear.\n\nNestler’s opening described the “stack” formations the defendants allegedly used to enter the Capitol. He played a video of defendant Jessica Watkins, who allegedly led the first group, pushing against a crowd outside the House chamber shouting “push, push, push! Get in there, they can’t hold us.”\n\nThe second group positioned themselves outside of a suite of offices belonging to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Nestler said. Nestler said that Meggs had a “keen interest in Speaker Pelosi,” and later told associates that “we looked for her.”\n\nAt first, the defendants saw the breach as a success, Nestler said, describing them as “elated,” “boastful” and “proud.” But, according to DOJ’s account, the defendants quickly realized they were in legal jeopardy, and instructed one another to flee town, delete messages and keep quiet.\n\n“Let me put it in infantry speak: SHUT THE F**K UP,” Rhodes said in one Signal message, as presented by prosecutors.\n\nEven with their criminal exposure, Nestler said, Rhodes continued to plot. On January 10, Rhodes met with someone in Texas to try and get a message to former President Trump. The meeting, which had not previously been reported, was secretly recorded by an attendee.\n\n“My only regret is that they should have brought rifles… we could have fixed it right then and there.” Rhodes said of January 6, according to the Justice Department’s opening.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's what Oath Keeper leader's estranged wife is '100% positive' he will do at trial 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nOath Keepers attorney: Defendants “had no part in the bulk of” January 6 violence\n\nRhodes attorney Linder told the jurors that they will see evidence that will show that defendants “had no part in the bulk” of the violence that occurred on January 6.\n\nHe suggested that there will be gaps in the evidence, such as video, that the Justice Department will show the jury. He said that, once the prosecutors put on their case, the defense will fill in those gaps.\n\n“You may not like what you see and hear our defendants did, but the evidence will show that they didn’t do anything illegal that day,” Linder said.\n\nAs the defense attorney delivered his opening, he was told by the judge to avoid topics that had been deemed out of bounds for the trial – with at one point, Judge Amit Mehta bringing him up to the bench for a private discussion.\n\nAmong the off-limits topics brought up by Linder that prompted the interventions were comments about the amount prison time the charges bring, the congressional narrative around January 6, remarks about defendants sitting in jail, and certain details about the Insurrection Act.\n\nMehta told Linder to keep his opening within the parameters of the relevant subject matter that has been established before the trial.\n\nLinder went on to preview other aspects of the Oath Keepers’ defense.\n\n“The real evidence is going to show you that our clients were there to do security for events for the 5th and the 6th,” Linder said, while calling his client a “extremely patriotic” and a “constitutional expert.”\n\n“Stewart Rhodes meant no harm to the Capitol that day,” Linder said, as he described some of the rhetoric among the defendants “free speech and bravado.”\n\nThe attorney said that the evidence will show that there was no plan like the one that the Justice Department is alleging.\n\nLinder said that Rhodes is planning to testify in his own defense to explain what he believed would happen on January 6. At least one cooperating Oath Keeper, William Todd Wilson, is also scheduled to testify during the trial, Linder said Monday. Linder said that he intends to ask Wilson about his plea agreement, including an allegation that Wilson witnessed Rhodes attempt to contact Trump on the evening of January 6.\n\nLinder suggested that allegation, which was sworn in Wilson’s plea agreement, was untrue.\n\nSpecific DOJ accusations picked apart by defense attorneys\n\nDavid Fischer, the attorney for Caldwell, zeroed in on how the Justice Department is pointing to the so-called QRF – a military term for Quick Reaction Force – that Caldwell allegedly organized that day.\n\nHe stressed the word “reaction” in that term, and said that QRFs are organized to respond “to emergency situations,” describing a QRF as “a break the glass emergency team.”\n\nOf the hundreds of witnesses, including several Oath Keepers, that the Justice Department has interviewed in its investigation, “not one single solitary person they have interview[ed] has said that the QRF was meant to attack the United States Capitol,” Fischer said. He ticked off other events, including protests taking place in other states across the country, where the Oath Keepers organized QRFs.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge from DOJ addresses agreements to hinder the government’s ability to conduct its business, and Fischer previewed for the jury a defense that would argue that the Justice Department had not proven Caldwell organized the QRF with that goal in mind.\n\nFischer also launched an extensive critique of how the FBI handled its investigation into his client, calling what happened to Caldwell and his wife “an absolute outrage.” Fischer said that the Facebook messages the FBI used to justify Caldwell’s arrest were actually lines from the movie “The Princess Bride.”\n\n“There was some other powerful evidence … the agent had an issue with a Facebook message that said … ‘I’m such an instigator’ … he also said ‘storming the castle,’” Fischer said.\n\n“The evidence is going to show that those phrases in context were” lines from ‘The Princess Bride,’” he added.\n\nJonathan Crisp, an attorney for Watkins, made similar assertions about the QRF, and he told the jury that the Justice Department’s case against his client was missing context in other respects.\n\n“The Zello chats sound incredibly damming if you listen to them in a vacuum,” he said, while suggesting to the jury that his client did not hear a lot of what was said on the walkie talkie application through the noise of the riot. He also pointed to her attempts to engage the FBI in its investigation\n\n“These are not the actions of somebody who was trying to overthrow the government.”\n\nSenators were crying, FBI agent says\n\nThe first prosecution witness, FBI agent Michael Palian, testified that he witnessed senators crying as they hid from rioters who entered the Capitol on January 6.\n\nPalian is one of the lead case agents who investigated the Oath Keepers during the course of the almost two-year investigation.\n\nPalian told the jury that on January 6, he was sent to the Capitol in the late afternoon and assigned to guard a group of over 80 senators sheltering in the Capitol complex.\n\n“It was chaotic,” Palian said of the scene when he arrived. “I think shock would be the best word to describe what the senators were feeling. There was some crying.”\n\n“Did you actually witness senators, or members of Congress, crying?” prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy asked.\n\n“I did,” Palian said.\n\nPalian and approximately 70 other agents escorted senators back to the Senate chamber later that night where they resumed counting electoral college votes, he testified. Inside the Capitol, “it looked like a bomb had gone off,” Palian said, recounting “windows broken, doors broken, lots of debris in the hallways” to the jury.\n\n“If you took your mask off you started to inhale the pepper spray,” Palian said.\n\nJudge stresses that jury is unbiased\n\nEarly into Monday’s proceedings, before the jury was brought in, Mehta went to great lengths to emphasize that the jury had “no preconceived” prejudices towards the Oath Keepers and the defendants specifically.\n\nHe did so while explaining why he was denying a request from the defendants that the case be transferred to Virginia. Mehta ticked through statistics from the jury selection process that shed light on how the jurors had responded to questions meant to test their impartiality.\n\nNone of them reported having strong feelings against January 6 that would affect their ability to be fair. While about half of the jurors said they had heard of the Oath Keepers before, none of them reported having strong feelings about Oath Keepers that would threaten the jurors’ impartiality, nor had any of the jurors heard of the specific defendants, according to Mehta’s account of their answers on the jury questionnaire.\n\n“What that means is voir dire has done its job,” Mehta said, referring to the jury selection process.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Hannah Rabinowitz", "Tierney Sneed", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319/index.html", "title": "Mark Meadows' 2,319 text messages reveal Trump's inner circle ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nCNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former President Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden’s January 20, 2021 inauguration.\n\nThe vast trove of texts offers the most revealing picture to date of how Trump’s inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the election results and then reacted to the violence that effort unleashed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe logs, which Meadows selectively provided to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, show how the former chief of staff was at the nexus of sprawling conspiracy theories baselessly claiming the election had been stolen.

There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMeadows’ messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN.\n\nAmong Meadows’ most frequent interactions were those with Fox’s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/08/22/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-rally/575083001/", "title": "Live updates: Police release gas on protesters after Trump speech", "text": "The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nPresident Donald Trump returned to Phoenix for a rally Tuesday. Check back for updates.\n\n11:05 P.M.: Police chief says night wasn't 'chaos'\n\nThe mayor of Phoenix and the Phoenix police chief declared success on Tuesday night following a speech by Trump that ended with streets filled with tear gas.\n\n“The good news is the job of the Phoenix Police Department tonight was to make sure that everyone got home safely,” Mayor Greg Stanton said. “The good news is that is exactly what occurred in Phoenix tonight.”\n\nTwo people were arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault on a police officer, said Police Chief Jeri Williams. Another person was arrested earlier in the day on an unrelated warrant, Williams said.\n\nReporters questioning the mayor and chief, some of whom were present as the scene unfolded, said they heard no verbal warnings and that there was little provocation. One described the scene as chaotic.\n\nThe chief denied that was the case.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it chaos,” Williams said. “Those are your words. I’m not going to use those words.”\n\nWilliams said that part of the use of force involved police showing themselves in full riot gear. Williams described that presence as an “act of showing we will show force if we have to.”\n\nWilliams said she heard from officers that the first gas came from protesters.\n\n“They had their own gas they threw at police, not our gas,” she said.\n\nSgt. Jonathan Howard, a department spokesman, told reporters that verbal commands to disperse were given. He said reporters who were with the protesters might not have heard all of them.\n\nHoward also said that officers first used directed pepper spray at individual protesters, before using the larger-scale pepper-gas balls.\n\nStanton said a small number of individuals marred what was a celebration of the First Amendment right of free expression, both inside the convention hall and outside.\n\nStanton said police worked with the groups that planned rallies and that he doubted any of the trouble came from those organizations.\n\n“We have no reason to believe that anyone who engaged in assault of a police officer were part of any organization that were encouraging people to come down here,” he said.\n\nBoth Stanton and Williams promised more answers after the department conducts an investigation of the events of the night.\n\n“Phoenix police is a wonderful organization,” Stanton said. “One thing they do well is they are willing to look in the mirror.”\n\n9:08 P.M.: Police fire more gas\n\nOfficers in riot gear started a slow march up Second Street toward Van Buren Street, clearing crowds following the Trump speech.\n\nEvery few feet, officers tossed gas at protesters. Television footage showed that at least one man was struck by a bean-bag style projectile.\n\n8:38 P.M.: Gas grenades in Phoenix\n\nPolice released pepper balls and pepper spray in the downtown Phoenix area after they said some protesters tossed rocks and bottles at officers, a department spokesman said.\n\nPolice also said that protesters dispersed gas in the area. A cloud of gas was seen on Second and Monroe streets. Reporters in the area heard two loud flash bangs on Third Street.\n\nAt least two Republic photographers were affected by tear gas.\n\nTrump's motorcade was back in Paradise Valley, according to a Republic reporter at the hotel.\n\n8:25 P.M.: Trump ends speech\n\nPresident Trump's speech has ended.\n\n\"Arizona will thrive and our beloved nation will succeed like never ever before,\" Trump said in closing.\n\n8:03 P.M.: Trump slams Arizona's senators\n\nTrump went after both of Arizona's senators in his speech Tuesday, but not by name.\n\nHe mentioned the health-care so-called \"skinny repeal\" vote that didn't pass the Senate. Sen. John McCain cast the deciding \"no\" vote, despite lobbing from Trump himself just before the vote.\n\n\"We were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming: repeal and replace,\" he said. He repeated five more times that repeal was just one vote away. The crowd started chanting, \"Drain the swamp.\"\n\nTrump said he was advised to keep up the tone of his Monday speech on the Afghanistan war\n\n\"They all said, 'Mr. President, your speech was so good last night. Please Mr. President, don’t mention any names,' \" Trump said.\n\n\"So I won’t. I won't. I won't, folks.\n\n\"One vote away. I will not mention any names. Very presidential.\"\n\nTrump then pivoted to Sen. Jeff Flake, again without naming him.\n\n\"Nobody wants me to talk about your other senator who is weak on borders, weak on crime,\" he said. \"So I wan’t talk about it.\n\n\"Nobody wants me to talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is. And now, see, I haven’t mentioned any names so now everybody's happy.\"\n\n7:43 P.M.: Trump hints at future Arpaio pardon\n\nTrump, during his speech, hinted at a forthcoming pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\n\"Do the people like Sheriff Joe?\" he asked the crowd.\n\n\"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? He should have had a jury.\n\n\"But you know what? I’ll make a prediction. I think he’s going to be just fine,\" Trump said.\n\nArpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for violating a court order.Trump had hinted in interviews that he was considering a pardon.\n\n\"But I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,\" he said, asking the crowd for its consent. The crowd cheered.\n\n\"But Sheriff Joe, feel good.\"\n\n7:27 P.M.: Trump blasts \"fake news\"\n\nTrump, in his speech, pointed out what he said was unfair treatment of his comments regarding the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump pulled a paper from his suit jacket that he said contained his statement from that Saturday, the day that a car drove into a crowd of marching protesters, killing one.\n\nBut, in reading it, Trump left out the \"many sides\" wording that caused so much furor from political figures.\n\nTrump also downplayed the size of the crowd outside the venue, saying the Secret Service said it was small.\n\n\"All week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside,\" he said. \"Where are they? Well, it's warm.\"\n\n7:08 P.M.: Trump begins speech\n\nTrump entered to the sounds of “God Bless the U.S.A.” by Lee Greenwood.\n\n7:02 P.M.: Carson fires up crowd\n\nU.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was met with thunderous applause as he took the stage to deliver remarks that centered on unity and inclusiveness. During the general election, he stumped in Arizona for Trump.\n\nDuring his brief remarks, Carson said there are forces “who want to divide us on the basis of race, age (and) religion.\"\n\nThe crowd booed.\n\nHe said the nation could not be divided and asked that hearts be filled with “love instead of hatred,” and tongues be used for “words of respect instead of slander.”\n\nHe was followed by prayers from Alveda King, a niece of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham.\n\nGraham then introduced Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n6:56 P.M.: Franks praises crowd size\n\nRep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said no one has crowds the size of Trump's.\n\n“I don’t go anywhere in the political world and see crowds like this,” Franks told The Arizona Republic from inside the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nFranks, a close ally of Trump’s in Congress, greeted the president at the airport when he arrived in Phoenix on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Franks was hopeful that the president would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, he didn’t think it would happen Tuesday.\n\n“I think that will happen. I don’t think that will happen obviously here today,” he said. “I think it will happen, because I think the president recognizes maybe better than most how it feels to be persecuted on strictly a political basis rather than a factual basis.”\n\n— Eliza Collins\n\n6:46 P.M.: Massive crowds ... in Cleveland\n\nAt least two photos were shared earlier Tuesday on Twitter purporting to depicting the large crowd size for the Trump rally in downtown Phoenix.\n\nThose photos were actually taken in downtown Cleveland during the parade for the Cavaliers who had win the 2016 NBA Finals. Both of the original tweets have been deleted.\n\n6:39 P.M.: Large crowds, no arrests\n\nThe gathering outside the Trump rally was large but relatively peaceful.\n\nAs of 6 p.m., no arrests had been made, according to Phoenix police.\n\nThe Phoenix Fire Department reported 26 heat-related calls, with two people transported to hospitals for further evaluation.\n\n— Megan Cassidy\n\n6:26 P.M.: Real fake news here to cover Trump\n\nJordan Klepper, a former correspondent for “The Daily Show,” was spotted interviewing several protesters and Trump supporters outside of the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nThe wry comedian's \"Daily Show\" spinoff, \"The Opposition,\" premieres Friday on Comedy Central. The new series will make fun of the hyperbolic and conspiracy-inducing \"fake news\" in the alternate-news media landscape, Comedy Central announced last month.\n\n— Garrett Mitchell\n\n6:20 P.M.: Trump headed downtown\n\nTrump has started moving towards downtown Phoenix.\n\nHis speech is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.\n\n5:57 P.M.: Rep. Gallego joins protesters\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, who earlier Tuesday called Trump an “abject liar” and “racist,” joined the protesters across from the convention hall.\n\n“This is a long-term exercise in democracy,” he said, urging peace.\n\nPolice had effectively separated the anti-Trump crowd from those who were entering the convention center for the speech.\n\nProtesters shouted that those entering the venue were taking a “walk of shame.” Some Trump supporters smiled and waved back.\n\nRetta Buntin of Gold Canyon said she came out to \"support the president.\"\n\n\"He's more concerned with people than with politics,\" Buntin said.\n\nBuntin and her high school friend, David Harris, held a yellow flag with the words “Don't tread on me.”\n\nHarris also said he supported the president.\n\n\"I don't remember any time in our lives when the president was so available to his base,\" Harris said.\n\n— Megan Janetsky, Megan Cassidy and Laura Gomez\n\n5:44 P.M.: Build that line\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m., the line to enter the convention center for Trump’s speech stretched down Second Street, headed east on Washington Street to Fourth Street, found its way to Jefferson Street in front of Chase Field and extended to Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nAlong Jefferson Street between the ballpark and the basketball arena, stood David Weller, 75, a Vietnam War veteran. He had doubts about whether he would get into the convention center.\n\n“I don’t think so, but we have to at least try,” he said. “I came here to see the president of the United States.”\n\n— Craig Harris\n\n5:20 P.M.: Waiting inside for the speech\n\nThousands of voters poured into the venue as Trump’s campaign playlist blared hits like Elton John's \"I’m Still Standing.”\n\nThe venue capacity is 19,000, a city spokeswoman said.\n\nCampaign volunteers handed out signs reading “Drain the Swamp,” “Veterans for Trump” and \"Buy American, Hire American.”\n\nKyle Beach said he drove from Los Angeles to hear “truth” from Trump. He wore a shirt bearing an image of Seth Rich and said he wants to know more about what happened to the man in the center of the conspiracy theory about the leaks of emails from the Democratic National Committee during last year’s presidential race.\n\n“President Trump is the only one who speaks the truth, he’s the only one who tells it like it is, and that’s the most important thing to me,” said Beach, 29, a designer. “I want to know what happened with Seth Rich ... and I want to know why the media framed Russia.”\n\nSusan McGraw of Sun City waited in line 2½ hours to see Trump because she wants to show her full-throated support of him in person.\n\n“I just like to listen to his voice, I love everything he says, he’s very positive, he’s 100 percent for our country, and he believes in our country, and he’s for our country,” the Republican voter said. “He is a great man. He’s like family, and we love him.”\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n5:03 P.M.: Let (cellular) freedom ring\n\nSocial-media posts claiming the Secret Service will shut down phone service around the Phoenix Convention Center for Trump's arrival were dismissed by the agency on Tuesday.\n\nThat includes both cellular service and social-media use.\n\n— Karisma Sandoval\n\n5 P.M.: Scenes from a Trump campaign stop\n\nSeveral groups of bikers made their way to the streets outside the venue. They had the stated aim of making sure attendees at the rally felt safe.\n\nThe invisible hand of the free market also made its presence shown. Concessionaires set up tables with both pro- and anti-Trump merchandise. “God Bless The USA,” blared from a boombox that was selling pro-Trump caps and shirts.\n\nOutside the convention center, Monroe Street was the dividing line. Those with tickets were allowed south; those without were kept north.\n\nAnd although Arpaio was not expected to attend the rally, protesters brought along a reasonable facsimile: a larger-than-life, inflatable Arpaio clad in jail stripes. The same inflatable had also been posted outside the federal courthouse during Arpaio’s contempt trial.\n\nNext to that inflatable was a Trump inflatable that showed the president clad in a white robe decorated with a Nazi swastika over his suit and tie. In one hand, the inflatable Trump held a white hood.\n\n4:42 P.M.: Marching toward Trump\n\nHundreds of people met at Civic Space Park near Arizona State University before walking to protest in front of the venue where Trump will speak.\n\nSome wore Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter T-shirts. Another group, self-identified as the \"John Browne Group,\" carried AR-15 rifles.\n\nPuente Arizona, One Arizona, Mi Familia Vota, and Progressive Democrats of America handed out water and granola bars from three big coolers before the group marched south on Central Avenue toward the Convention Center.\n\nThey began their chants: \"No Trump; No KKK; No Fascist USA\" and \"This is what democracy looks like.\" The march ended in front of the Herberger Theater, across the street from the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\n— Laura Gomez\n\n4:22 P.M.: Trump arrives at Montelucia\n\nTrump's motorcade traveled up State Route 51 to the Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia.\n\nThere had been a steady police presence outside the hotel through the afternoon.\n\nTwo officers at the entrance directed vehicles away from the hotel.\n\nA SWAT vehicle and several undercover police vehicles began entering the resort at around 3:30 p.m. Their presence increased over the hour until the motorcade arrived.\n\n— BrieAnnaFrank\n\n4:12 P.M.: The protest scene\n\nAt least a dozen organized groups were planning protests against Trump outside the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, a number of individual protesters had gathered across the street from the convention center on Second Street just south of Monroe. The atmosphere between protesters and supporters standing in line waiting to get into the convention center was tense at times. Some shouts were exchanged.\n\n\"Build that wall,\" chanted supporters.\n\n\"Tear the wall down,\" chanted protesters.\n\nCathy Harvard of Phoenix held a handmade \"Impeach\" sign. The 58-year-old receptionist said this was the first Trump event that she protested, and she felt strongly she needed to show up outside the convention center to speak her mind. She said she left work at 1 p.m. to get to a spot outside the convention center.\n\n\"I do not like that man. He does not belong in the White House,\" she said. “He needs to be impeached. He needs to go.\"\n\nStanding in the shade across from the convention center, she wiped her brow with a washcloth.\n\n\"He shouldn't even be in Arizona,\" she said. \"He's out having a campaign rally. Like someone is going to vote for him in 2020?\"\n\n— Anne Ryman\n\n3:47 P.M.: Trump lands in Phoenix\n\nTrump has landed in Phoenix.\n\nAir Force One left Yuma around 3:13 p.m. and landed about 30 minutes later at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, approaching from the east.\n\nA crowd of about 60 supporters were on hand to greet him. A cheer erupted when Trump emerged from Air Force One and waved at them.\n\nOn the tarmac, Trump was greeted by Rep. Trent Franks and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nTelevision cameras showed Ducey getting into the limo with Trump and Vice President Pence and driving away. Ducey was seated facing backwards and appeared to be having an animated conversation with Trump.\n\n3:31 P.M.: Not the same old supporting acts for Trump\n\nDon't expect all of the usual suspects to be on stage Tuesday with Trump, according to organizers. One notable absence will be Arpaio.\n\nAmong those expected to attend: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nThe agenda, which was not finalized as of early Tuesday afternoon, was expected to include a prayer for unity in the wake of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe VIP list also includes state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, one of Trump’s earliest supporters for president, and his wife, Marina; former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, an ardent Trump supporter and one of his defenders in chief; Phil Lovas, a former state lawmaker who now works for the Trump administration; and Lori Klein, the Arizona Republican National Committeewoman and former state lawmaker.\n\nKlein, in 2011, pointed a loaded handgun at a reporter's chest during an interview. Months earlier, she was stopped as she tried to carry that same handgun into the state Capitol during the State of the State address. It was two days after the shooting at a grocery store outside Tucson that killed six and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was the target of a failed assassination attempt.\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n3:14 P.M.: Goldwater Park closed; Paradise Valley prepares\n\nIt is not known what Sen. Barry Goldwater would think of President Trump if he were alive today. There is no way today to gaze upon his statute and contemplate it.\n\nThe Barry Goldwater Memorial, a small Paradise Valley park dedicated to Arizona’s most famous senator, is closed Tuesday due to Trump’s planned overnight stay at a resort across the street.\n\nThe entrance to the free attraction, which opened in 2004 on the northeast corner of Tatum Boulevard and Lincoln Drive, is blocked and there is a sign that says, “Park Closed.’’\n\nThe memorial is across the street from the Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia, where Trump is expected to stay on Tuesday night after his rally in downtown Phoenix. The sidewalks in front of the resort on Lincoln Drive are closed beginning at Tatum Boulevard.\n\n— Dawn Gilbertson\n\n3:02 P.M.: Next stop, Phoenix\n\nYUMA – President Donald Trump has boarded Air Force One.\n\nHe spent time taking selfies with Marines and signing autographs.\n\n2:52 P.M.: Drawn-out denial for Steve Benson\n\nSteve Benson is a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist and a respected presence at The Arizona Republic. But that, and an email, still could not get him a credential into the Trump campaign stop.\n\nBenson was told in an email Sunday from the campaign press office that his credential request had been denied.\n\n“Any name that does not appear on our list, will not be permitted to enter as credentialed media,” the email said. The misplaced comma was in the email.\n\nBenson has good company.\n\nAlso denied credentials were KPHO-TV’s Morgan Loew and Gilbert Zermeno. The reporter and cameraman have long teamed up to do investigations for Phoenix’s CBS affiliate.\n\nZermeno, on Facebook, posted: “Guess I’ll be looking for a scalper.”\n\n2:42 P.M.: Sky Harbor prepares\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was already showing signs of preparation for the president's arrival.\n\nThe plane ramp at the executive terminal, the small building that sits near the west end of the airport, usually faces out to Sky Harbor Boulevard over a strip of landscaping and grassy span.\n\nLarge shuttle buses of the type that normally ferry passengers to the airport’s rental-car center were lined up, one after another, just inside the metal fence around the terminal. Black fabric on the fence further obscured the view. Police cruisers lined up at the entrance to the terminal’s small parking area.\n\nAir Force One is expected to arrive at the terminal Tuesday afternoon following the president's stop in Yuma.\n\n2:16 P.M.: No pardon for Arpaio\n\nTrump will not pardon Arpaio during his visit Tueday, according to a White House spokesperson.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said in a tweet that the lack of a pardon showed the power of activist groups like Puente Arizona, One Arizona, Lucha, Promise Arizona, Mi Familia Vota and others.\n\n1:57 P.M.: Trump arrives in Arizona\n\nYUMA – Trump has arrived in Arizona. He landed at 1:43 p.m.\n\nHe remained inside Air Force One for close to 10 minutes before emerging with a smile and waving to the small crowd that welcomed him to the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma.\n\nHis chief of staff John Kelly followed the president down the stairs. They then got into the vehicle escort that would take them to a series of appointments.\n\nFirst up, Trump met with officials from Customs and Border Protection at their hangar near the airport, and saw some of the equipment they use to patrol the Yuma border area.\n\nHe them went into a closed-door briefing regarding border enforcement measures.\n\nDuring this time, Marines stationed on base lined up in 106-degree weather at the tarmac, waiting for the chance to greet the commander in chief, before he set out to Phoenix.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n1:26 P.M.: Will Trump pardon Arpaio?\n\nSpeculation is mounting whether Trump will pardon Joe Arpaio and many are taking to social media to express both support and opposition to a pardon.\n\n\"Obama pardoned traitor Chelsea Manning, Trump will pardon a patriot in Joe Arpaio,\" wrote one Twitter follower.\n\nAnd then there is this tweet from a follower who opposes a pardon.\n\n\"Trump: How can I distract people today. Maybe I will find the most racist criminal I can find & pardon him. Enter, Joe Arpaio,\" @funder\n\nHalf of Arizonans believe Trump should not pardon Arpaio, according to a poll conducted over the weekend.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n10:30 A.M.: Group opposes Arpaio pardon\n\nThe non-profit Mi Familia Vota hosted a news conference outside St. Mary's Basilica to denounce Trump's visit to Phoenix and his potential to pardon Arpaio.Speakers represented various organizations, including Center for Biological Diversity, CHISPA, Planned Parenthood of Arizona, and the Arizona Coalition for Change.\n\n\"We will continue to organize our community — educate them — and ensure that folks that align with out values are elected into office to represent our community,\" Mi Familia Vota spokesman Eduardo Sainz said.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D.-Ariz) and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero spoke.\n\n\"We refuse to stand idly by while Trump destroys everything America stands for,\" Romero said.\n\nMany of the protesters in attendance had signs and t-shirts announcing the community will not be divided and they will stand strong. The biggest sign was designed by the Center For Biological Diversity, which, translated from Spanish, said, \"Migration is natural. We reject the wall.\"\n\n— Gabriella Del Rio\n\n10:15 A.M.: Schools, businesses closing\n\nTrump's rally has prompted many businesses, offices and stores in the downtown area to close early for the day, although some will remain open. Some schools in the area also are sending students home early.\n\nThis is a sign posted on the Starbucks at the Arizona Center.\n\nThis is the first time in recent memory that a political rally has triggered a widespread closure of businesses, stores and offices, report Kaila White and Garrett Mitchell.\n\nSome are closing to avoid traffic congestion, others out of safety concerns since this is the first Trump rally in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n9:30 A.M.: Need a new hat?\n\nMerchandise tables have begun to pop up right next to the growing line for the rally.\n\n\"Make America Great Again\" hats and shirts are being snatched up by the handful by supporters who dared to step out of their place in line to purchase one.\n\nShirts with President Trump's face and phrases such as \"Built Trump Tough\" and \"It's gonna be YUGE\" line the tables.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n9:15 A.M.: Check out the kicks\n\nAmong the growing crowd of supporters, there are a few with unique Trump-inspired outifts.\n\nThe favorite so far is a pair of high-top sneakers with Trump written down the side and a \"Make America Great Again\" insignia on them.\n\nJohn Rynhard of Phoenix sported the shoes. He said he bought them for $69.99 online about six months ago.\n\n“I was on Facebook and an ad popped up for Trump shoes,” Rynhard said. “So naturally, I clicked on it and that’s where I found them at.”\n\nRynhard said he had been waiting to go his first Trump rally to wear them so today is the first time they'd hit the pavement.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n9:12 A.M.: Trump to tour Yuma first\n\nPresident Trump will get a first-hand look at both the effectiveness and challenges of building a wall along the border when he visits the Yuma area in southwestern Arizona Tuesday, hours before his rally in Phoenix.\n\nIt will be the first time Trump has visited the border since he became president, reports The Arizona Republic border reporter Rafael Carranza, who will be covering his visit to Yuma.\n\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to build a \"great, great\" wall along the southern border, and his visit to Yuma is expected to demonstrate to his supporters that he isn't backing off that promise.\n\nIllegal immigration and drug smuggling were once out of control along this part of the border until Congress approved 62 miles of fencing. The Border Patrol's Yuma Sector is now one of the quietest along the southern border, where overall apprehensions of undocumented immigrants have fallen to some of the lowest levels in decades.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\n8 A.M.: Trump supporters up for hours\n\nThe first dozen Trump supporters are already gathered at the convention center in anticipation of Trump's arrival later in the afternoon.\n\nThe first arrived at noon Monday. The next handful were there by 4 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nGene Huber, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was first in line after coming in at noon Monday.\n\n\"I just love to see him,\" Huber said of Trump. \"The excitement that he brings to our family and 'We The People' our movement.\"\n\nHuber was later joined by Alexis Marcelino and Tracey Opbroek, of Apple Valley, California.\n\nMarcelino said she hopes Trump spends at least a portion of his speech clarifying that his supporters do not reflect the views of hate groups like Nazis and white supremacists. She said she doesn't want to see people with swastikas supporting Trump in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\"We all agree that that is hateful and I kind of hope from there that we can move on,\" she said.\n\nOne of the most vocal supporters in the crowd is Irma Trujillo, of El Paso, Texas, who arrived with a bright neon pink sign that read \"Deplorable Latina Loves Trump.\"\n\nShe got a big round of applause from the rest of the group.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the pardoning of Joe Arpaio,\" Trujillo said. \"I have to see it. I am so excited for that, if it happens.\"\n\nThe doors for the rally open at 4 p.m.\n\n— Terell Wilkins\n\n7 A.M.: Look for the chicken\n\nThe 20-foot inflatable Donny the Tax March Chicken is apparently working his way to Phoenix.\n\nThe giant chicken, made in the likeness of President Donald Trump, has been popping up in Washington, D.C., on and off for several months. According to its handlers, the chicken symbolizes the need for transparency in the Trump Administration and a continued push for Trump to release his tax returns.\n\nThe organization Indivisible Surprise is hosting Donny's Phoenix visit.\n\n— Alia Beard Rau\n\n6 A.M.: Potential for drama\n\nAmong the few points President Donald Trump's supporters and critics would likely agree on is that the former reality-TV star's administration hasn't lacked drama. And his visit Tuesday to Phoenix, his first as president, certainly has the potential for drama.\n\nSEE ALSO:What to expect for Trump rally in Phoenix\n\nAmong the looming questions is whether Trump will pardon Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a court order to halt his signature immigration patrols. Trump has said he was seriously considering a pardon for the 85-year-old lawman, who was among his first high-profile supporters.\n\nAnother question is whether Trump will go after Sen. Jeff Flake, the state's junior Republican senator who's running for re-election and has been one of the president's loudest GOP critics. Flake recently published a book in which he criticizes the direction of his party under Trump, as well as the president's pugilistic tone. Will Trump endorse a Flake challenger?\n\nSome will also be watching Trump's tone in the wake of Monday night's policy speech on his strategy for the war in Afghanistan. Some were struck as much by his measured tone as his acknowledgment that he is changing course from his call during the campaign to withdraw from Afghanistan. Is this a lasting shift in tone or another quiet moment interrupting the bombast the American public has become accustomed to?\n\nFinally, there's one place authorities hope to see no drama: the streets of downtown Phoenix.\n\nThis is Trump's first major public address since his tepid response to the death of a Charlottesville, Virginia, woman amid demonstrations by white supremacists was seen by many as a low mark for this White House.\n\nImmigration activists are hoping to have thousands on hand to protest Trump's policies and, should it happen, an Arpaio pardon. Given there will be thousands of Trump's supporters on hand for the rally, it could be a volatile mix.\n\n— Michael Squires\n\nMONTINI:Will Trump trash McCain, Flake then pardon Arpaio? | ROBERTS:Trump headed to AZ to endorse Jeff DeWit? | EDITORIAL:Trump let North Korea control his next move\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nEx-Gov.

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLast week, Bannon’s legal team subpoenaed 16 lawmakers and congressional staffers to testify at the July trial and produce documents, according to one of Bannon’s attorneys and copies of the subpoenas provided to CNN. The subpoenas were aimed at all nine members of the select committee, three committee staffers and General Counsel for the House of Representatives Douglas Letter. Bannon also subpoenaed House Democratic leadership, including Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Rep. Jim Clyburn.\n\nA spokesman for the House committee declined to comment. Spokespeople for Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn did not immediately respond to requests to comment.\n\nHistorically it has been a challenge to compel members of Congress to testify because their legislative activity is protected under the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause.\n\n“In this particular case I’m extremely confident that the staff members and members of the House would be shielded by the Speech and Debate Clause,” said Thomas Spulak, who served as general counsel to the House of Representatives in the 1990s.\n\nThe lawmakers and staffers could file a motion to quash the subpoenas on those grounds.\n\n“I’m very confident that defense would be upheld, and they will not be compelled to produce anything or appear for anything,” Spulak said.\n\nBannon’s attorneys are seeking to challenge the makeup of the House select committee, question lawmakers’ motives for targeting Bannon and argue Bannon was not required to testify because doing so could have jeopardized former President Trump’s executive privilege.\n\n“I believed from the start that it’s a purely political motive going after Bannon,” said David Schoen, one of Bannon’s attorneys. He said if the committee truly wanted Bannon’s testimony, it would not have referred him for criminal contempt charges.\n\n“They’ll never get his testimony now,” Schoen said. “I have to draw the conclusion it’s purely a political message. They’re afraid of the message Bannon puts out there.”\n\nOther Republicans have also challenged the legitimacy of the committee and refused to testify. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused to comply with a committee subpoena, claiming it was not legally valid. Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro, who has been charged with two counts of contempt of Congress, also refused to testify and has cited executive privilege issues and claimed his subpoena from the “kangaroo committee” was unenforceable.\n\nThe subpoenas also call for targets to hand over a roster of documents, including items relevant to the establishment of the committee, the decision to refer Bannon for criminal contempt and communications with one of Bannon’s lawyers. In the case of Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, Bannon’s team has also requested documents that pertain to their recently published books.", "authors": ["Sara Murray"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/09/11/sheriff-joe-arpaio-legacy/71888720/", "title": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio has always done it his way", "text": "Michael Kiefer\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nJoe Arpaio’s office is as big as his ego.\n\nIt sits atop the headquarters that the Maricopa County supervisors built for him on Jackson Street in 2013, part fortress and part temple to America’s Toughest Sheriff. And though Arpaio is not a large man, he fills the room, from the oversized desk at one end to the oversized conference table at the other.\n\nHe speaks of himself in the third person; he pounds his fists on the table as he speaks.\n\n“This sheriff has been elected six times,” he said in an interview. “He must be doing something right. So the people must like this sheriff.”\n\nThe word comes off his tongue sounding like “SHIR-uff.”\n\nArpaio has been the sheriff of Maricopa County for more than 22 years, the longest-serving sheriff in county history.\n\n“Why am I doing this?” he continued. “I ask myself this question. I’m going to give you the old political thing: People want me to do this.”\n\nIt’s true: Arpaio is incredibly likable.\n\nAnd he is a conundrum, an unlikely idol, unsophisticated, gruff, decidedly blue collar. His face appears frozen in a half sneer. He is of average height, maybe an inch shorter. He is not a fashion icon, from the over-long sleeves of his sports jackets to the old-fashioned tie tack in the shape of a pistol.\n\nHe has been married to the same woman for 58 years. He is a doting grandfather.\n\nAnd he is a right-wing rock star.\n\nHis friend, the political consultant Jason Rose, calls him, “A PR genius and a freak of political nature.”\n\nHe speaks in bumper-sticker slogans.\n\nHe reduces reality to good and evil — and he is the good guy who goes after the bad guys.\n\n“He says it like it is to the average people,” said Bruce Merrill, a pollster and former professor at Arizona State University. “Older folks see crime on TV, they see immigration. A guy like Joe symbolically saves them. It’s kind of like he’s a superhero.”\n\nHe has garnered national attention, national admiration, national loathing.\n\nHe has embarked on quixotic crusades that have endeared him or villainized him to Maricopa County residents and national pundits alike. He tilts at windmills, whether questioning if President Barack Obama was born abroad, filing suit in federal court over Obama’s immigration policies, or waging war on illegal immigrants — which has landed him and the county in legal hot water.\n\n“He spends millions of dollars on things that are not his job,” former Maricopa County Manager David Smith said.\n\nAnd indeed Arpaio has expanded the scope of the office beyond its principal job description of jail keeper. During his tenure, the sheriff became an immigration officer, a crusader against county corruption and an investigator of presidents.\n\nAs a result, Joe Arpaio may also be “America’s Most Expensive Sheriff.”\n\nLegal battles have cost Maricopa County taxpayers $142 million\n\nSince Arpaio first took office in 1993, cases involving him or his office have cost taxpayers $142 million in legal expenses, settlements and court awards, and yet he has been repeatedly re-elected.\n\n“I know I’ve been sued a few times,” he said with a shrug.\n\nIn fact, he has been sued more than a few times.\n\nThere were enormous court awards for deaths in the jails, some of which were so large they were paid by insurance companies, instead of the county.\n\nHis deputies arrested journalists for writing about him, and taxpayers paid for it.\n\nHe arrested and a former county attorney filed charges against sitting judges, supervisors and county employees in 2008 and 2009. All of the cases fell apart. All of the targets sued and settled.\n\nHe is currently facing contempt of court in the wake of a racial-profiling and civil-rights lawsuit brought in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. And because Arpaio failed to follow the judge’s orders in that case — and may have had the judge investigated — the major question remaining is whether he will be found in civil or criminal contempt.\n\nThose hearings resume Sept. 24 in front of that judge, U.S. Dictrict Court Judge G. Murray Snow.\n\nAn overlapping federal lawsuit lodged by the U.S. Department of Justice against Arpaio has already cost millions to defend. But taxpayers got a break there, since Arpaio and the county supervisors settled most of its issues out of court.\n\nNonetheless, Arpaio plans to run for re-election in 2016.\n\nHe does what he wants.\n\nArpaio likes the job of sheriff because he is his own boss.\n\n“I don’t have to report to any city manager, mayor, governor,” he said. “I have the right to make decisions.”\n\nHe frequently says, “No one tells the sheriff what to do.”\n\nHis old flip phone goes off incessantly; its ring tone is Frank Sinatra singing “My Way” at a decibel level an 83-year-old man can hear from across that spacious office.\n\n“I don’t have any iPad, uPad,” he said as he pointed way across the room to his desk. “That’s my computer: a Smith Corona typewriter.”\n\nIronically, according to two of the county supervisors, much of the $40 million that the county will have to pay to bring the office into compliance with a court order from the federal racial-profiling case is for technology updates that should have been made years ago.\n\nHe brags that he gives money back from his budget every year, though he has averaged more than $6 million in lawsuits and legal expenses for every year he has been in office.\n\nBut no matter how much trouble he gets into, newspaper readers keep sending letters to The Arizona Republic saying that Sheriff Joe is the only person doing anything about immigration and crime.\n\nAs Merrill, the pollster, said, “It’s not what’s true or not, it’s the perception of things.”\n\nAnd Arpaio’s chief deputy, Jerry Sheridan, summed it up: “The sheriff is the face of law enforcement for a lot of people in this county.”\n\nMany in Arpaio’s own party think it’s time for him to retire\n\nHe was once the most popular politician in the state, with an approval rate above 70 percent. That has slipped recently to 38 percent. He squeaked through his last election, in 2012, with 50.7 percent of the vote, leaving political watchers to wonder if this is the end of his run.\n\nThere are plenty of politicians from his own party who think it is time for him to leave. They complain about his disregard for the law, his lack of understanding of investigation procedure, of probable cause, his office’s history of putting opponents under surveillance.\n\nRumors that his deputies were following perceived enemies first surfaced in 1999, when a law-enforcement union told federal investigators the Sheriff’s Office was tailing a county attorney, an attorney who had sued him and a federal judge. In 2010, he even had an investigator for the State Bar followed. Arpaio staged an immigration raid on Mesa City Hall that embarrassed that city’s police chief.\n\nSome former prosecutors, all Republicans like Arpaio, would rather see him retire.\n\n“He’s a malicious influence in law enforcement,” said former U.S. Attorney for Arizona Paul Charlton. “It is time for this guy to step down and leave, and it’s certainly time for the voters to ask him to leave.”\n\n“It’s way past time for Arpaio to go,” said former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a Republican. “It’s amazing to me that so-called conservatives will look the other way when someone has abused the power of government in the most extreme fashion.”\n\nAnd former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, another Republican, said, “I’m not sure he came into office with the primary interest of the public good. That was secondary to what he wanted to do, which was promote Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArpaio denies that he craves publicity, but his friends and enemies say otherwise.\n\nHis office has been the set and subject of countless TV shows. He let the action-movie star Steven Seagal stage a reality show with one of his posses. The big coffee table in the waiting area outside of Arpaio’s office is covered with magazines bearing his face, most of them captioned “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” which Arpaio claims was coined by the TV show “60 Minutes.”\n\nArpaio’s two books extol his exploits as a cop in Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas and his swashbuckling days as a federal drug agent in Turkey and Latin America. He arrests the bad guys because he is a two-fisted individual who follows his own rules.\n\nAnd by living up to that reputation, he is now facing contempt of court — or worse.\n\nInside Sheriff’s Office headquarters, people seem alternately cocksure and anxious about whether Arpaio and his top deputies will be found in criminal contempt, whether there will be another Department of Justice criminal investigation into the office, like the one started in 2008, during the George W. Bush presidential administration, and dropped in 2012.\n\nThe contempt allegations, in part, were raised because Arpaio and his chiefs ignored the initial court order to stop racially profiling Latinos, essentially seeking out illegal immigrants under the guise of legitimate traffic stops.\n\nHis attorneys so far have failed in their bid to get the federal judge to recuse himself from the case because the judge questioned a pair of apparent investigations involving the judge and his wife. Arpaio is appealing the ruling.\n\nThose attorneys in the racial-profiling suit would like him to lie low on immigration matters. He cannot.\n\nSheriff defends Donald Trump at Phoenix campaign rally\n\nThough he claims not to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy, Arpaio defended remarks by the billionaire real-estate mogul that Mexicans are rapists and criminals, flowing through the border like water.\n\nTrump expanded on his anti-illegal-immigrant rant at his July Phoenix rally in front of nearly 5,000 angry “patriots” who cheered at every claim he made.\n\nArpaio took the podium before Trump, introduced in circus-barker terms as “The Greatest Lawman on Earth.”\n\n“We got a couple things in common,” he began. “The (Obama) birth certificate: He investigated it; I did. We both want to do something about the illegal immigrants.”\n\nThe crowd cheered. Then without irony, Arpaio said, “Isn’t this great in America, where anyone can run for president?”\n\nEven billionaires, one supposes. The crowd cheered again.\n\n“And second: freedom of speech,” he said, laying the words out like a bullet point.\n\nNever mind that a half-hour later, a group of young protesters would be swarmed by rally attendees when they tried to unfurl an anti-Trump banner. They were then escorted out of the conference hall by security guards, again to cheers.\n\nJoe Arpaio: ‘I won’t surrender and I won’t quit’\n\nDespite the ongoing contempt hearings relating to racial profiling, Arpaio’s publicity machine still sends out solicitations for campaign money in exchange for Arpaio’s continued vigilance on the immigration front.\n\n“Meanwhile, I’ve become the target of defeat because of my support for enforcing illegal immigration laws! This is nothing but pure politics,” said one recent pitch. “But I won’t surrender. And I won’t quit.\n\n“I don’t care if it’s the ACLU, liberal attorneys or these extreme open-border groups that want to see me gone. I’ve been the Sheriff for over 22 years and I took an oath to protect and defend both the Constitutions of the state of Arizona and the United States — and I will do that for as long as I am in office.”\n\nThe reward for contributing $100 to his campaign, the e-mail goes on to say, is a personally autographed photo.\n\nBut during the interview in his office, Arpaio’s attorney was sitting at his side to make sure he didn’t speak too freely. And when the subject of the pending contempt-of-court hearings came up, Arpaio suddenly went quiet.\n\n“I would love to talk to you,” he said. “Do you really think I don’t want to tell you? It frustrates me.”\n\nHe stopped pounding the table. His hands dropped to his lap and fidgeted nervously.\n\nHe seemed to ponder the legal fight ahead, if only for a moment.\n\nBut he soon returned to defiance; weeks later, U.S. marshals raided Arpaio’s headquarters because he still had not turned over evidence as ordered by the judge in the racial-profiling case.\n\nCue the music: “I did it my way.”\n\nJoseph Michael Arpaio has been a loner all his life.\n\n“The day I was born, my mother died in childbirth,” he has said more than once.\n\nHis parents were immigrants from Naples, Italy. His father ran a grocery store in Springfield, Mass. Since Arpaio was motherless and his father was busy at work, he was shuttled around the neighborhood from one Italian family to another.\n\n“There was a lot of discipline,” the Maricopa County sheriff told The Arizona Republic in 2002. “I don’t remember what I did to get whacked. I can’t actually tell you why.”\n\nA childhood friend told The Republic that Arpaio was withdrawn as a kid. Arpaio himself claims he was a mediocre student.\n\nPerhaps he has always been fearless as well.\n\nWhen he graduated from high school, he joined the Army and was sent to France. After three years in the service, he mustered out as a sergeant and landed a job walking a police beat in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere he met his wife, Ava Lamb, to whom he has been married for almost 58 years. They have two children, a son and a daughter. (As a matter of full disclosure, the daughter is married to the editor of the editorial pages for The Arizona Republic.)\n\nMost of what we know about Arpaio’s career as a cop and a federal agent is of his own telling in his two books, “Sheriff Joe Arpaio: America’s Toughest Sheriff,” published in 1996, and “Joe’s Law,” published in 2008.\n\nActually, Arpaio didn’t write either of them, and he has said he hasn’t even read them. As recently as this year, he denied he said some of the things in the books when they came up in a court of law.\n\nInstead, they were written by an author named Len Sherman, who works in Arpaio’s office. Sherman captures the grandiosity of Arpaio’s voice and the bravado of his tales. Some critics have postulated that the stories are embellished.\n\n“He has press clippings from everything he ever did,” Sherman said, except perhaps a claim that when Arpaio was a police officer in Las Vegas, he once made Elvis Presley pull over on his motorcycle and then, instead of issuing a citation, took him back to the station to sign autographs for the boys.\n\nDuring interviews, Arpaio opened file drawers in his office to show commendations, newspaper stories, even reports he typed up while he worked overseas for the federal Bureau of Narcotics. Arpaio remembers the names of perpetrators he arrested 60 years ago.\n\nWalking a beat in a tough D.C. neighborhood, the Arpaio voice of the books said, Arpaio knew the good guys and the bad guys, “the lone lawman striding down main street at high noon, taking on all comers.”\n\n“Not that everybody was glad to see me,” he wrote. “Given my gung-ho disposition, I didn’t wait for somebody else to let me know a crime was being committed. I did my own footwork, my own investigating, and I took matters into my own hands.\n\n“Not for nothing did I ‘win’ the title of ‘Most Assaulted Cop in D.C.’ in 1957, with a grand total of 18 serious encounters — not a little pushing and shoving, not a couple of taps and it was over, but full-out battles.”\n\nHe used his blackjack and nightstick 'without hesitation'\n\nIt was a time before “modern sensibility,” when it was OK to break heads, and Arpaio (as channeled by Sherman) extolled the bone-crushing properties of his police-issued blackjack and the reliability of his nightstick, “... and I used both without hesitation and whenever necessary, which was often.”\n\nArpaio spent three years on the D.C. police force, then six months in Las Vegas, before he was drawn to Chicago to work for the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThat agency threw him onto the street without wasting any time sending him to “special Treasury school to get indoctrinated into the ways and means of my new job.”\n\nHe spent four years in Chicago, using his wits to bust drug dealers, playing “a hundred roles, with a thousand stories to accompany them,” and earning the nickname “Nickel-Bag Joe,” because there was no bust too small.\n\nThen in the early 1960s, he was shipped out to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nArpaio’s stories from Turkey are glorious, as he travels to “the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing but trouble and danger. ... One day I’m meeting with the president of Turkey, the next day I’m shooting it out with bandits in the hinterlands.”\n\nHe repeatedly extols his disregard for the rules. He single-handedly takes 30-some Turkish opium farmers into custody, “which I mention quite incidentally, I had no authority to do.” After a shootout in which two drug dealers were killed, he angered the local governor, who “had not been properly forewarned and advised of my investigation,” and was accused of murder until the American embassy stepped in.\n\nThe typed reports he keeps in his office from those days document the gun battles and describe hauls of opium and morphine base in quantities up to a ton that he confiscated while working with Turkish law enforcement.\n\nHe ran out of bullets but still got the bad guy\n\nAfter three years in Turkey, the agency transferred Arpaio to Washington, D.C.\n\nSeveral newspaper articles in his files tell of a 1968 bust in Virginia when he shot it out with drug dealers while his partner was hiding in a car trunk.\n\nThe drug dealers had a gun to Arpaio’s head; Arpaio lunged for the weapon, and a melee began. Then, Arpaio, who describes himself as a lousy shot, ran out of bullets, but he managed to talk the drug dealers into surrendering to him anyway.\n\nBy 1970, he was abroad again, this time based in Mexico as director for regional operations, sending other agents to bust the bad guys in Latin America, dealing with corrupt leaders, he claims, and tracking a French drug mastermind to Paraguay.\n\nHe consulted with the U.S. ambassador in Paraguay, “and the ambassador told me I couldn’t work operationally on the ground or with the local police.”\n\nArpaio’s response: “Of course I can operate.”\n\nHe sent a covert crew on an unmarked government jet.\n\n“The son of a bitch might have been smart, but he was easy pickings,” Arpaio/Sherman wrote, referring to the French drug impresario. Working with local officers, his agents snagged the Frenchman, and he was “hustled aboard the jet, which flew directly to Dallas, allowing us to forgo extradition problems between the two nations.”\n\nSo much for laws. The bad guy went to prison, according to the book.\n\nArpaio came back to the U.S. in 1973 and worked at the highest levels of the newly renamed Drug Enforcement Administration. He did stints in Washington, Boston, and finished out his career in Phoenix as special agent in charge of Arizona.\n\nAfter he retired in 1982, he went to work in Ava’s travel agency, where he arranged flights for extradited criminals for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and offered potential orbital flights into outer space at $52,000 a pop.\n\nThen, in 1992, when he was already 60 years old, Joe Arpaio decided to run for sheriff.\n\nIn August 1991, Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies were called to the Wat Promkunaram Buddhist temple in Waddell, which served a mostly Thai community near Luke Air Force Base.\n\nThere they found nine bodies, face down in a circle, with their heads toward the center. They had been shot execution-style.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office was then under the leadership of Sheriff Tom Agnos, who had been in office for one four-year term. Detectives hustled to solve the crime, and they rushed to judgment, arresting four Tucson men on a tip provided by a mentally ill man.\n\n“The Tucson Four,” as they became known, were driven to Phoenix and cloistered in hotel rooms where MCSO detectives browbeat them until they confessed to murders they did not commit.\n\nOnly by coincidence did MCSO detectives stumble upon the real killers, Alex Garcia and Johnathan Doody, a pair of teenagers who met in a high-school ROTC club, and they forced confessions out of them, too, trying to tie them to the Tucson Four. Eventually, when it became obvious that the Tucson men were innocent, then-County Attorney Rick Romley dropped the charges.\n\nOne of the teens confessed and was sentenced to life in prison. The other was found guilty of first-degree murder by a jury, though a federal appeals court later threw out the conviction because of the forced confession. He was re-convicted in 2014. Maricopa County paid out more than $2 million for the false arrests. And Agnos was tarnished and vulnerable.\n\nJoe Arpaio came into the race touting his drug-fighting experience and promising to carry on that fight as sheriff. He swore he would serve only one term, a promise he now says was a mistake, and one that he obviously did not keep.\n\nBut voters were distressed by the Temple Murders and the ensuing scandal and lawsuits. Arpaio squeaked by Agnos in the Republican primary, winning by 6,000 votes, then won decisively in the general election.\n\nAlmost immediately, Arpaio burst into the public eye, and his legacy has been a litany of gimmicks.\n\nOne of his earliest publicity coups came after Arpaio realized inmates were stealing underwear and taking it home when they were released. Arpaio ordered that it be dyed pink. It created an uproar that appealed to Arpaio, and he began selling the pink underwear in shopping malls, where he would personally autograph it for adoring fans.\n\nThere were some unintended consequences: An Irish court refused to extradite a pedophile priest who had fled the U.S. after being charged with sex crimes in Phoenix; the court ruled that the pink underwear was demeaning and proof of Arpaio’s abuse.\n\nArpaio also wrangled Army surplus tents, which he erected at his Durango Jail to house DUI arrestees and other low-security offenders. It was dubbed “Tent City,” and if it got warm or was deemed harsh, Arpaio was routinely quoted as saying, “Jail is not a country club.”\n\nSheriff Joe holds a press conference for every new idea\n\nArpaio’s other get-tough measures were similarly touted.\n\nHe changed the jail uniforms to old-fashioned, black-and-white horizontal stripes, like something out of a cartoon. He sent prisoners, including women, out on the streets to work in chain gangs. He served up green bologna sandwiches to the inmates, banned Playboy and other men’s magazines from the jails, denied access to coffee or cigarettes and chose the music and TV shows for the inmates.\n\nHe held a press conference for each and every new idea.\n\nThe public loved the tough-guy stance — and also when Arpaio showed his soft side by housing homeless dogs in an air-conditioned section of an outdated jail.\n\nIt played well to national media. Arpaio installed webcams in the jails and invited every media outlet to tour them. There were reality shows about female deputies, documentaries about Arpaio himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the public largely ignored lurid deaths of prisoners at the hands of detention officers or other inmates, even though they ended in spectacular jury awards.\n\nIn 1996, a man named Scott Norberg died after being beaten and tied into a restraint chair in one of the jails; in 2001, a mentally disabled man named Charles Agster met a similar fate in a restraint chair. Their families were awarded more than $17 million combined.\n\nThe Department of Justice took notice, investigating jail conditions multiple times since 1995. Sometimes the investigations would be dropped, other times federal judges would take the side of prisoners. But Arpaio always claimed victory.\n\nAmong the sheriff’s statutory duties is the ability to stage a posse, and Arpaio created them for every occasion: cold cases, animal abuse, aerial search and rescue.\n\nMany of them were established as non-profit organizations that amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. The cold-case posse, for example, was the main player — and payor — in Arpaio’s investigation into President Barack Obama’s birthplace.\n\nNot all of his ideas passed muster with the law. When he announced early in his tenure that he would set up roadblocks around the county to stop drug smugglers, he came up against Romley, who told him the plan was not constitutional.\n\n“When he initially came to me, I told him ‘no’ on a number of questions,” Romley said. “He quit asking questions.”\n\nArpaio tangled with Romley again and again over the next 12 years, to the point where Arpaio tried to get Romley removed as his official lawyer under the statutes.\n\nNotable among the disagreements was a 2004 fight over a prostitution sting at massage parlors. Romley dropped 60 cases when it came to light that some of the deputies had gone nude and engaged in sex acts with the prostitutes they arrested.\n\nDo the duties of a sheriff include investigating the president?\n\nAccording to Arizona state statutes, the law-enforcement responsibilities of a county sheriff are vaguely defined as preserving the peace, arresting criminals and stopping riots.\n\nA sheriff’s main duties, as detailed in the statutes, are to attend the courts; keep the county jail operating and get the prisoners to court; do process serving; coordinate search and rescue missions; and take possession of the homes of deceased persons.\n\nArpaio expanded his duties to go off on political tangents, like investigating Obama’s birthplace and caring for abused pets. And he made himself the enforcer of state immigration law.\n\nPolicing illegal immigrants brought Arpaio to the nation’s attention — and to federal contempt-of-court hearings. Arizona was ground zero in a short-lived trend to write state laws to make up for a perceived lack of enforcement from the feds.\n\nBut immigration enforcement went from being the greatest asset to the biggest liability in Arpaio’s portfolio.\n\nHis second biggest liability was going after perceived enemies among elected officials and judges.\n\nThe third was a misunderstanding, perhaps disregard, of how public monies are spent and managed.\n\nAll three played out simultaneously between 2006 and 2010, and together, for better or for worse, they brought him to where he is today.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio once saw himself as a defender of immigrants. He had spent part of his career in Latin America, after all, and he claimed an affinity with Hispanics.\n\nIn April 2005, an Army reservist named Patrick Haab pulled a gun on five men he thought were illegal immigrants at a rest stop on Interstate 8. He made them lie down on the ground, and he called police.\n\nArpaio had Haab arrested.\n\n“Even law enforcement has to have probable cause before taking people out of their cars and telling them to lie on the ground. ... He threatened to kill them,” Arpaio told the media at the time. “He did not have the right to do what he did. How did he know they were illegal aliens?”\n\nBut County Attorney Andrew Thomas refused to press charges against Haab, saying that the immigrants and their smuggler had committed felonies by entering the country illegally. Haab, he said, had every right to make a citizen’s arrest.\n\nThe incident frosted relations between Arpaio and Thomas. Attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who would later work for both, claims that he brokered a truce between the two elected officials. That truce led to a disastrous collaboration.\n\n“We created a double-headed monster,” Wilenchik said.\n\nThomas had run for office with the brash promise that he could stop illegal immigration. Thomas helped pass the first state immigration laws in the country, working with Senate President Russell Pearce, who had once been Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nTo this day, Pearce remains a faithful Arpaio supporter. Soon, states across the union were passing their own immigration laws.\n\nArpaio takes center stage during anti-immigration fervor\n\nAnti-immigration fervor raged in Arizona. Arpaio, ever conscious of the public center of attention, signed on to the fight against immigration, and made it his own.\n\nIn 2006, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office investigated the first case to go to trial on Thomas’ theory that people sneaking into the state from Mexico could be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit human smuggling.\n\nThe case was dismissed after prosecutors rested because sheriff’s deputies had based their investigation entirely on the immigrants’ confessions, which is not enough to establish probable cause.\n\nNo other conspiracy to commit human-smuggling cases ever went to trial again, though many immigrants charged with the crime pleaded to lesser offenses and were deported.\n\nThe next year, 2007, Thomas and Arpaio helped the state Legislature push through the Employer Sanctions Law, creating consequences for businesses that hired illegal immigrants. The raids on businesses, ranging from furniture manufacturers to water parks, followed.\n\nDeputies arrested immigrants on felony charges of identity theft and forgery, ostensibly so that they could then build a civil case against the business (which rarely happened).\n\nArpaio or his chiefs would field complaints from citizens about Hispanic day workers gathering near businesses or about people speaking in Spanish in restaurants. Deputies and posse members were sent in saturation patrols to predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, pulling over drivers for cracked windshields, failure to use turn signals and other minor offenses and asking them for proof of citizenship.\n\nThen Arpaio held press conferences to publicize the raids and issued press releases to announce the arrests.\n\nUnder other laws pushed through by Thomas during that period, the illegal immigrants could be held without bond. The jails filled up.\n\nThe percentage of illegal immigrants arrested was exactly proportional to their presence in the general population, but their percentage in the jails swelled because they couldn’t be released like native citizens or legal immigrants who were charged with the same crimes. Arpaio touted the numbers as proof of the criminality of immigrants.\n\nBy 2007, immigration had become Arpaio’s main priority. That year, his office aligned with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in a program called 287(g), which allowed local law-enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law and gave them access to the federal database used to track and verify citizens and legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nAt the press conference to announce the new agreement, Arpaio took the microphone and mischaracterized what the program allowed his office to do.\n\n“Actually,” he said, “ours is an operation, whether it’s the state law or the federal, to go after illegals, not the crime first. ... My program, my philosophy is a pure program. You go after illegals. I’m not afraid to say that. And you go after them and you lock them up.”\n\nThose words would come back to haunt him in court.\n\nReporter rides along with deputies determined to arrest immigrants\n\nOther law-enforcement agencies balked at arresting immigrants, which brought Arpaio and Thomas closer together.\n\nIn 2007, when they signed their agreement to implement the new law that imposed sanctions on employers who hired illegal immigrants, Thomas publicly praised his partner’s “track record of enforcing our immigration laws and not caving in to political correctness.”\n\nThomas issued legal opinions averring that MCSO’s crime-suppression sweeps did not constitute racial profiling and that they were being carried out according to protocol.\n\nDespite what he and Arpaio would claim at press conferences, at times the profiling seemed blatant.\n\nOn a hot April afternoon in 2008, I rode in an MCSO cruiser during a crime-suppression operation in Guadalupe, accompanying a male and a female deputy who had been yanked off the animal-abuse unit to look for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe deputies were looking every which way, trying to figure out whom they should pull over. They were following instructions to pull over cars only in Guadalupe, regretting that they had to ignore likely prospects across the street in Tempe and noting that when it got dark, they could pull over people on bicycles if they didn’t have lights on their handlebars.\n\nFinally, they started following a couple of teenagers in an old beater, tailing the car until the driver made a turn without signaling and they had a reason to pull him over. The driver looked Mexican. He didn’t have a driver’s license or a green card. They thought they had an arrest.\n\nThen the teenager took out his cellphone and called his mom, who drove to the scene of the traffic stop from her house a few blocks away. She was angry.\n\nShe showed the teen’s driver’s license to the deputies. The boy wasn’t Mexican, he was Yaqui, and he had been born in Arizona. He had simply left his license at home. The deputies got back in their car and drove on.\n\nArpaio showed up in Guadalupe that evening for his photo opportunity. He was caught completely off guard when Rebecca Jimenez, the town mayor, got in his face and complained about the harassment of her townspeople.\n\nHe was so annoyed at Jimenez that he withdrew his office’s police coverage of the town, which did not have its own police force.\n\nIt was not the first nor last time he tangled with a public official.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2006, Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools Sandra Dowling and her husband, Dennis, were coming home from a meeting with her attorney.\n\nThe meeting was related to her battle with the County Board of Supervisors over her pet project, the Thomas J. Pappas Schools for the Homeless, which were seen by the supervisors as an expensive budget drain.\n\nDowling had won the initial court battles proving that the elected officials on the Board of Supervisors could not tell another elected official how to run his or her office.\n\nMaricopa County officials called Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s office to say they thought deficits in Dowling’s budget came from misuse of funds, and MCSO served search warrants on Dowling’s office and her home.\n\nThe Dowlings’ daughter called to tell them someone had broken into the house.\n\nDowling told her, “Call the police.”\n\nThe daughter answered, “It is the police.”\n\nWhen Dowling and her husband arrived, she recalls, there were three helicopters and at least 35 Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies wearing SWAT team gear.\n\n“Every time I see Joe, he tells me there was only one helicopter, because they only had one,” Dowling said. She assumed the others were media helicopters.\n\nIt was cold, and Dowling was wearing a short-sleeved blouse, but when she tried to enter her house to get a sweater, she said, a deputy stiff-armed her and knocked her to the ground.\n\nShe called her lawyer, who told her to leave before she was arrested. She and Dennis went to a neighbor’s house and watched the raid on television.\n\n“You would have thought it was a murder scene from the media coverage,” she said.\n\nThey didn’t get back to their ransacked house until after 3 in the morning.\n\nEleven months later, Dowling was indicted on 25 criminal counts related to the operation of the Pappas Schools, including what investigators and prosecutors said was the theft of $1.9 million in public money.\n\nThe case was being prosecuted by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, but it passed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office when Arpaio began investigating Attorney General Terry Goddard on unrelated matters that never came to fruition.\n\nThe Dowling case fell apart, the charges were thrown out, and Dowling ultimately pleaded guilty to a Class 2 misdemeanor for giving a summer job to her daughter. She was sentenced to probation that expired when her term of office ended. She sued, alleging malicious prosecution, and was eventually granted a settlement of $250,000.\n\nIt was the first of the assaults on supposedly corrupt elected county officials.\n\nSheriff’s Office takes on Phoenix New Times owners\n\nNext Arpaio took on the media.\n\nIn 2007, Arpaio’s chief deputy, David Hendershott, ordered the arrest of the owners of Phoenix New Times, Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.\n\nThree years earlier, the alternative news weekly had published an article that revealed the addresses of several properties owned by Arpaio. The story violated an obscure state law that makes it illegal to publish a law-enforcement officer’s address online; strangely, it is not illegal to publish such addresses in print.\n\nArpaio pushed County Attorney Andrew Thomas to press charges. Thomas appointed Dennis Wilenchik as special prosecutor. Wilenchik then issued a subpoena demanding documents related to the story and a list of the newspaper’s online readers.\n\nLacey and Larkin responded by defying grand-jury secrecy and revealing the contents of the subpoena\n\nDeputies showed up at their houses in the dead of night and threw them into dark SUVs with tinted windows and Mexican license plates. Although the two publishers were detained briefly, no charges were filed. They were ultimately awarded a $3.75 million settlement.\n\nThe immigration push also cost money, perhaps more money than the Sheriff’s Office had to spend.\n\nIn November 2007, just four months into its fiscal year, MCSO was already more than $1 million over its overtime budget for the year because of its practice of moving personnel around.\n\nOne of the solutions reached was to stop taking some jail inmates to their Superior Court hearings — which immediately angered the court’s presiding criminal judge.\n\nMaking sure that prisoners get to court is one of the sheriff’s main jobs; defendants are put in jail to make sure they get to court. Not allowing them to go to hearings raises constitutional issues and denies them due process.\n\nBut MCSO chiefs claimed they didn’t have enough detention officers to handle the court traffic, until they were reminded by the county supervisors that they had been given money to staff more officers than they had working. Sheriff’s chiefs and officers were dragged into contempt-of-court hearings.\n\nArpaio also began limiting jail visits by lawyers who were working with clients in custody, triggering another court battle.\n\nOther duties went untended.\n\nIt also came to light in 2007 that the office had failed to investigate hundreds of sex crimes, 60 percent of which were against minors.\n\nAn Arizona Republic series later found that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in some cases did not meet basic investigative standards like promptly following up with victims, doing early background checks on suspects, coordinating with other agencies and promptly presenting cases to prosecutors. Then the agency lost track of $600,000 to hire child-abuse investigators, and the money was never found.\n\nLater, Maricopa County finance staff would realize that over eight years, MCSO had misallocated $99.5 million by paying employees out of the wrong accounts and moving money around.\n\nThe failure to recognize basic accounting standards — in other words, that accounts are dedicated to specific purposes — launched the biggest political assault of Arpaio’s career.\n\nIn 2008, facing a slumping economy, the Board of Supervisors cut the sheriff’s budget.\n\nThe sheriff and Thomas responded with the newly formed “Maricopa County’s Anti-Corruption Effort,” also known as MACE.\n\nSuddenly, they were seeing corruption everywhere.\n\nSupervisor Stapley indicted on 118 counts, convicted of none\n\nIn December 2008, Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley was indicted on 118 felony and misdemeanor counts arising from omissions on annual financial statements he filed as an elected official.\n\nStapley did not think the financial statements were the real motive for the charges.\n\n“It was flat-out the budget,” Stapley said, and the charges were payback for the budget cuts, he thought, mostly at the request of Thomas and Hendershott, Arpaio’s chief deputy.\n\nHendershott took issue with $340 million in cash that had been set aside to build a new Superior Court building, averring that some of that money could be diverted to MCSO.\n\nWorking with Thomas, the Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation into the court, but Superior Court Presiding Criminal Judge Gary Donahoe declared a conflict and ordered Thomas off the case.\n\nThe animus heated up, with Thomas and MCSO on one side and the county management and Superior Court judges on the other.\n\nIn August 2009, sheriff’s deputies seized a county computer system, claiming that the county should not have access to certain law-enforcement data. Both sides sued.\n\nThe county yanked funding from Thomas and created its own civil-litigation unit because officials claimed that Thomas could no longer represent the county in court because of the ongoing litigation.\n\nBy September 2009, the charges against Stapley had been dismissed after it was discovered that the county had never actually instituted a requirement that supervisors file financial statements. Hendershott had Stapley arrested the next day in a county parking garage, referring him for charges on more than 95 new counts, including allegations of fraud related to campaign funds.\n\nThomas declined to prosecute, saying the case wasn’t ready.\n\nBut three months later, in December 2009, the hammer fell. Stapley was indicted on 22 charges. Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, a longtime critic of Arpaio, also was indicted on 36 charges alleging impropriety in taking loans from an agency the board had provided with funding. And Judge Donahoe was charged with bribery related to his rulings on the court tower.\n\nThen Arpaio and Thomas filed a civil-racketeering lawsuit in federal court against the Board of Supervisors and several Superior Court judges, including Donahoe, claiming they had conspired against them.\n\nBy March 2010, all of the charges and the lawsuits had been dismissed or dropped, triggering a tsunami of litigation.\n\nStapley’s case was also withdrawn, but Thomas did not give up on it.\n\nHe referred it to Gila County Attorney Daisy Flores, who concluded that Stapley may have committed fiscal transgressions, some of which might have been minor felonies, but that most of the charges were not crimes.\n\nFurthermore, Flores said that the investigation was so flawed and politically motivated that it could not be pursued.\n\n“The way in which the investigation and prosecution of Stapley progressed was fundamentally wrong, and to pursue further criminal actions against Stapley would be a miscarriage of justice,” Flores wrote.\n\n“The vast record is littered with behavior so egregious that a reasonable person’s sense of fairness, honesty and integrity would be offended. The (Gila County Attorney’s Office) is left with no choice but to decline this matter.”\n\nCounty officials win settlements of more than $8 million\n\nSupervisors Stapley, Wilcox and Andy Kunasek and Judge Donahoe sued; so did three other judges who had been targeted, several county employees and a business associate of Stapley.\n\nBy the time the dust cleared, taxpayers had paid more than $8 million in settlements, and more than $5 million in legal bills, plus another $6 million for other litigation in the cross-fighting.\n\nThomas and two of his deputy county attorneys were charged with ethics complaints by the State Bar of Arizona for their role in the attacks on judges and elected officials and were called before the Arizona Supreme Court’s disciplinary judge.\n\nBefore those hearings, it came out that sheriff’s deputies were tailing the Colorado attorneys who had been retained by the state Bar to investigate and prosecute, and the deputies in turn were tailed by FBI agents.\n\nThomas and one of his deputies were disbarred; the other was suspended from practicing law for six months.\n\nHendershott was fired.\n\nBut Arpaio came out unscathed.\n\nPeople in the Sheriff’s and County Attorney’s Offices were subjects of a federal investigation into abuse of power initiated during President George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nThe investigation was discontinued in September 2012 by U.S. Attorney for Arizona John Leonardo, who coincidentally had been the Pima County Superior Court judge who dismissed the criminal charges against Wilcox.\n\nIn a recent Republic interview with Arpaio, he cited that dismissed investigation as proof that the feds had nothing on him.\n\nBut civil-rights lawsuits had already been lodged by the American Civil Liberties Union and by the U.S. Department of Justice over an alleged pattern and practice of racial profiling against Latinos.\n\nTaxpayers would pay the cost.\n\nIn the thick of controversy, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio maintains a sense of humor and enjoys bantering with the press — even with reporters who have written unfavorable stories about him. Bad press is better than no press, and even negative stories make Arpaio’s supporters rally around him.\n\nHe is impulsive, which is, at once, his charm and his liability. He seems to have no filter, no self-censor, whether speaking to a convention or a reporter, a TV camera or a person on the street. He swears readily. He is always defiant.\n\nArpaio is facing contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop his immigration enforcement polices; hearings resume Sept. 24. The judge appointed a monitor to keep the office in compliance with orders in a federal racial profiling case.\n\nYet one afternoon, when the subject of his patented pink jail underwear came up, Arpaio turned to me and said, “I even gave a pair to the court monitor.”\n\n“Obviously, it hasn’t helped me any,” he said with a wink and a stagey smile.\n\nEncounters with the sheriff sometimes seem like surreal one-act plays.\n\nI first met him more than 20 years ago, at a north Phoenix department store where he was being fitted for a suit. I introduced myself and asked some long-forgotten reporter’s question.\n\nHe looked me in the eyes, scrunched up his face, and out of nowhere, said, “You’re too good-looking to be a reporter.”\n\nIt was as if someone had set off flashbulbs in my face. I was stunned and didn’t know how to respond. The conversation ended quickly.\n\nFast-forward at least 15 years. I was walking under the covered walkway between the two Wells Fargo buildings in downtown Phoenix, where Arpaio used to have his offices.\n\n“Hey Mike, hey Mike,” he called out. “How come you write all those nice stories about Andy Thomas?” referring to the former Maricopa County attorney who was disbarred for his role in prosecuting judges and county officials.\n\nHe had told me more than once that he would give me an office in his building if I would write about him.\n\n“They aren’t nice, Sheriff,” I answered.\n\n“I’m Italian,” he said. “You know what nice is for me? I stick the knife in, but I don’t twist it.”\n\nJust then, Chief Deputy David Hendershott lumbered by, looking like he was trying to get through the door without having to talk to Arpaio.\n\n“Dave, you don’t return my calls,” Arpaio said. He walked over to him. Hendershott stood speechless and stared at him. Arpaio started pulling aside the lapels of Hendershott’s sport coat.\n\n“You got your new gun with you?” Arpaio asked Hendershott. “Show Mike your gun.”\n\n“Don’t make him shoot me, Sheriff,” I joked.\n\nArpaio chuckled.\n\n“Aw, it would do more damage if I told him to Tase you,” he said.\n\nHe has maintained that sense of humor and human engagement over the two decades I have known him and reported about him and his office. It is why he maintains a following despite his many trials.\n\nI was once contacted during the height of the immigration sweeps by a Mexican journalist who wanted to know more about Arpaio before she interviewed him. She intended to write a damning critique of his policies.\n\nShe got angry when I told her that regardless of her reporting and her outlook, if she interviewed him, she would end up liking him, at least on an interpersonal level.\n\nArpaio begins his day early, stays at the office late\n\nArpaio also has a strong work ethic. He begins his day early and stays in the office late. As a concession to his age, he said, he only gives a speech a day now instead of two. Insiders say he spends the last hours of his workday in his office on his couch thinking or strategizing with his brain trust, cooking up the next defense, the next diversionary tactic, the next press release.\n\n“I’m not planning, I’m doing paperwork,” he counters.\n\nAge does not slow him down.\n\n“If you’re talking about his energy and his mental capacity, I haven’t seen any changes,” said Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan. “He is on the ball about things that are important to him. He can remember things like nobody I have ever met in my life.”\n\nExcept perhaps when he is on the witness stand. During the current contempt-of-court proceedings, as in the disciplinary hearings that led to former County Attorney Thomas’ disbarment, Arpaio was suddenly forgetful and couldn’t recall details.\n\nAttorney Michael Manning, who has become a wealthy man representing wrongful-death and civil-rights cases against the Sheriff’s Office, laughs when he recalls the explanation for memory lapses when Arpaio is on the witness stand.\n\n“In all of the cases I’ve had with him in front of a jury,” Manning related, “he said, ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got the flu.’ ”\n\nOn the stand, Arpaio says that he delegates day-to-day management to others. But as Sheridan said, he is on the ball about “things that are important to him” — which have become more eccentric.\n\nHis office brushed aside death threats made against attorneys in the Jodi Arias case, but when someone threatened CNN trial maven Nancy Grace, he sent investigators to make an arrest and got a conviction — even though the threat maker was in New York state and the person threatened was in Atlanta.\n\nIn his book, “Arpaio: De Facto Lawman,” former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands wrote that Arpaio does not understand basic concepts like probable cause.\n\n“In reality, Arpaio wasn’t really running anything,” Sands wrote. “He just wasn’t paying attention. Instead he concentrated on running a full-time political campaign throughout his tenure in office,” Sands wrote.\n\nThe office was “constant managed chaos and damage control,” he wrote. “If it created controversy, Arpaio enjoyed the media attention.”\n\nAllegation that he doesn’t really like animals stings\n\nSands claims Arpaio is obsessed with death threats and once made deputies seize a pay phone from which a threat was made and run fingerprint tests on all the coins in the coin box, even though detectives told him it would serve no purpose.\n\nAnd he likes conspiracies, real or imagined: an improbable plot to kill him, involving the Mexican Zetas, the Minutemen vigilantes on the border, and a Phoenix Hispanic activist, for example, which Arpaio describes in one of his own books. Or conspiracies involving President Barack Obama and the federal government.\n\nIn his book, Sands recalls the day when a “tea party” group begged Arpaio to investigate whether Obama was born outside the United States, something Sands thought had already been settled. Arpaio referred to that investigation at the Donald Trump rally in July as if it were still ongoing.\n\nSands also said that despite Arpaio’s animal posse and well-publicized care of homeless dogs, Arpaio does not really like animals. It is the allegation that seemed to most upset Arpaio during an interview, and he said he did not have dogs because he did not feel it was safe for his wife to walk them because of security risks.\n\n“I have security issues I don’t want to get into,” he said.\n\nBut Arpaio has had many lesser leaps of logic over the years that I witnessed.\n\nIn 2007, at the time when MCSO stopped bringing jail prisoners to court, ostensibly to save money, Arpaio got called for jury duty, and his publicity people sent out press releases about how the sheriff was going to do his civic duty, just like any other citizen.\n\nArpaio’s panel was canceled, but he showed up anyway. And his office invited reporters to take advantage of the photo op, ignorant of two facts: You can’t shoot photos in the court hallways, and you can’t photograph jurors.\n\nI walked into the hallway on the seventh floor of the old East Courthouse; I had an office a floor above. I touched Arpaio’s arm as I walked past, and he jumped and didn’t recognize me.\n\nMinutes later, he suddenly noticed me.\n\n“Hey, Mike, hey Mike,” he called to me, and then he chatted about his impending jury service.\n\nI brought up the prisoners who weren’t making it to court, and how that amounted to denying their constitutional right to due process under the law, and Arpaio said it was the first he had heard of it. The next day, the policy seemed corrected, at least for a while.\n\nArpaio: Respect for those who come here legally\n\nDecisions can seem illogical, though it is difficult to tell if they come from Arpaio or from elsewhere in his office.\n\nIn 2007, a court interpreter named Ramon Delgadillo called to tell me that MCSO had instituted a new policy at the jail, requiring naturalized citizens to prove they were citizens.\n\nDelgadillo, a well-respected, 25-year employee of the county, was just going to the jail to do his job, but he was not allowed onto the premises because he did not have his naturalization papers. Naturalized citizens are not required to carry them.\n\nI called Arpaio. He said he was not aware of the policy, though he had ordered that no illegal immigrants would be allowed in the jails to visit anyone. But he bluffed anyway, and said that no one had a constitutional right to go into the jail.\n\nI asked him what papers he had in his wallet that proved that he was a citizen. He thought about it. Then, as we were speaking, he acknowledged that his own parents were naturalized citizens.\n\nThe next morning, I got a phone call from Arpaio’s public-information officer, who told me that Arpaio had rescinded the policy. I called him again.\n\n“I do have a deep respect for those who come here legally, like my mother and father who came from Italy, went through the system and became naturalized,” Arpaio said. “I have a deep respect for them. That’s one reason I’m going to change this policy.”\n\nBy 2010, the federal government and the federal courts would start changing the rest of his immigration policies.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s crusade against illegal immigration launched him from a late-show punchline to a national figure.\n\nStarting in 2005, Arizona was in the vanguard of states looking for local solutions to a national immigration problem. Arpaio was Arizona’s most visible enforcer.\n\nBut then, one by one, the state’s immigration laws that had propelled Arpaio into the national spotlight were disassembled by the federal courts.\n\nMost of the provisions in the multilayered and controversial Arizona immigration legislation called Senate Bill 1070, were blocked by a U.S. District Court judge in Phoenix in July 2010, before they could go into effect.\n\nTwo years later, the only part that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed back into the law books was a statute allowing police to inquire about the citizenship of people after they were stopped for other reasons.\n\nLater, the concept of charging immigrants as conspirators for smuggling themselves into the country was knocked down, and then the entire “coyote,” or human-smuggling, law was thrown out. So was the law requiring that illegal immigrants arrested on felony charges be held without bond.\n\n“Don’t blame me for that,” Arpaio said. “It was a federal decision.”\n\nAlso in 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice yanked the 287(g) certification for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office— the program that allowed MCSO to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union’s racial-profiling lawsuit was filed in 2007, on behalf of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican tourist who was in the country legally, but was detained for nine hours as if he were an illegal immigrant.\n\nOther Hispanics who had been arrested during immigration-control operations joined in and it became a class action.\n\nArpaio meets his match: Judge G. Murray Snow\n\nIn 2011, U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow ordered Arpaio to stop enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nThe case went to trial in 2012, and in May 2013, Snow issued his findings: Arpaio and his staff had reacted to complaints about Mexicans gathering, especially day laborers, and staged their saturation patrols and raids accordingly, Snow found.\n\nThe deputies, Snow determined, used race as a major factor in deciding whom to pull over and whom to question. And even after MCSO’s 287(g) authority was revoked, Arpaio still told deputies they could enforce federal immigration law and that being in the country illegally was a crime, instead of what Snow called “an administrative violation of federal immigration law.”\n\nIn October 2013, Snow ordered the Sheriff’s Office to cease its immigration-control operations, submit to oversight by a “court monitor,” and update its technology to include cameras and data collection.\n\nThen, a year after the order, Snow brought Arpaio and his chiefs back into court.\n\nArpaio admitted that he and his deputies had continued to enforce federal immigration law for 18 months after being ordered not to, and that they had failed to turn over video and audio evidence.\n\nThe contempt-of-court hearings continued into the spring of this year, when the bombshell dropped.\n\nOn April 23, Arpaio was on the witness stand, when Snow suddenly asked him about two stories from Phoenix New Times.\n\nOne story claimed that Arpaio had sent a private investigator to look into whether Snow’s wife had told an acquaintance that Snow didn’t like Arpaio and wanted him out of office.\n\nThe other story alleged that Arpaio had an investigator in Seattle researching supposed CIA data showing connections and communications between the judge, then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others. Arpaio acknowledged both investigations, but claimed that the information obtained was “junk.”\n\nArpaio’s lawyers subsequently asked Snow to remove himself from the case; the contempt hearings ground to a halt pending Snow’s decision. The investigations revealed conflicts of interest, they now claimed. And Snow asking about them raised even more conflict, they wrote in their motion.\n\nThen, on July 10, Snow denied the motion and refused to step down. For one thing, he wrote in his order, MCSO and Arpaio had been aware of the supposed conflicts of interest for more than a year and had deemed them unreliable. To bring them up again at this point in the contempt hearings, Snow wrote, was a deliberate delay and an “attempted manipulation.”\n\nArpaio appealed the ruling.\n\nSources inside MCSO say that those investigations never really took place, and that things are not what they seem.\n\nThe tip that Snow’s wife was bad-mouthing Arpaio at a Tempe restaurant was checked out by a private investigator, and then MCSO lawyers advised the office to just forget about it. It was put aside.\n\nA return of the birther investigator\n\nThe bigger stink that Arpaio was investigating links between Snow and the Department of Justice came out of another whimsical undertaking.\n\nDennis Montgomery, a Seattle-based computer expert who had worked on the birther investigation — that is, Arpaio’s probe into President Barack Obama’s birthplace — told MCSO that he had proof that the federal government was illegally gathering information about American citizens, including many from Maricopa County.\n\nJust as in the birther investigation or the unsuccessful federal lawsuit against Obama’s immigration policies, Arpaio had another chance to defy the president on behalf of the little guy.\n\nBut MCSO brass sent deputies to keep Montgomery on task. Myriad e-mails among Montgomery, his lawyer and MCSO supervisors chide Montgomery for dumping data and videos he had gathered from multiple sources, including Al-Jazeera, the Arabic news network. And when the office reached the point that they were going to cut Montgomery loose, he upped the ante and produced a “flowchart” alleging communication among Snow, Holder, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona, and others.\n\nBy then, more than $120,000 had been paid to Montgomery, and MCSO’s attorneys and top brass wanted to pull the plug. But the document got out into the light and was unsealed in the court record.\n\nSnow was not convinced. In his ruling, he noted that based on e-mails provided by MCSO, the Montgomery investigation continued up until the “eve” of the contempt hearings.\n\nAnd he noted that even after denouncing both investigations as “junk,” Arpaio’s lawyers still tried to use them to remove Snow from the case.\n\nNor does history help the sheriff’s case.\n\nArpaio clearly has a record of investigating and suing judges who made rulings he did not like.\n\nAnd it is noteworthy that former MCSO Deputy Chief Brian Sands, in his book, claims that Arpaio believed that his investigation of Obama’s birthplace would create a conflict with federal authorities that would protect him from legal action.\n\nAccording to Sands, after launching that apparently ongoing investigation, Arpaio said, “Now let them go after me with this abuse-of-power thing.”\n\nArpaio denied making the statement.\n\n“I knew it would make it worse for me,” he said.\n\nCounty officials detail Sheriff’s Office’s legal costs\n\nAccording to county officials and other sources, Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office have been the reason for more than $142 million in payouts for settlements, court awards and attorneys’ fees since Arpaio took office.\n\nThe county’s Risk Management Department, which is its self-insurance program, has paid more than $78 million in settlements, awards and litigation since Arpaio took office in 1993. Less than half of that, $30 million, is actually for jail claims, and another nearly $20 million was paid out for traffic accidents, boating accidents and other small claims.\n\nThe rest of the risk-management figure, more than $28 million, was paid for legal matters listed as civil-rights violations, false arrest, conspiracy and malicious prosecution, which would include the Dowling, Phoenix New Times and county-wars settlements.\n\nBut there’s more.\n\nThe county Office of Management and Budget has paid out another $6.2 million for other legal costs of the county wars.\n\nThe Department of Justice lawsuit has already cost nearly $5 million. Like the Melendres racial-profiling case, it alleged civil-rights violations and discrimination against Latinos in traffic stops, and the judge on that case accepted the Melendres conclusions to rule that racial profiling indeed took place. That suit also alleged discrimination in the jails and raids on work sites as well. And it addressed Arpaio’s retaliation against the other elected and appointed county officials.\n\nBut the county and the Department of Justice settled most of the rest of the case out of court, because Arpaio had already changed the office’s immigration policies (if not his personal opinions), sidestepping more costly litigation.\n\nBy next year, the cost of the Melendres case will reach $52.5 million, plus attorney costs to be determined. And Snow is talking about holding another trial to determine compensation for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe county’s running total as of Aug. 31: $142,040,779, of which $91,934,494, nearly two-thirds, is because of Arpaio’s court and political battles.\n\nBut those figures only show how much money was paid out by the county. The total legal expenses are actually higher. At times, there were co-defendants in the lawsuits who had to pay a share of a jury award of settlement. And awards over $5 million, like the two wrongful-death cases involving restraint chairs in the jails, were paid by insurance, with the county only paying a deductible of $1 million or $2 million.\n\nOnly two of the Maricopa County supervisors criticized Arpaio for the financial cost.\n\n“I personally get the feeling that enough’s enough,” said Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board’s lone Democrat, who is in the first year of his first term. “The board is tired of shelling out millions of dollars for things that are not his job. He’s not even doing his job.”\n\n“We have a laundry list of projects and we can’t do them because of the sheriff,” Gallardo said.\n\nSupervisor Andy Kunasek, the only supervisor still in office who was targeted by Arpaio and former County Attorney Andrew Thomas during the county wars, said, “If, God forbid, I was sheriff, I’d exit now with as much grace as possible, because it’s not going to get any better.”\n\nThe other three sitting supervisors were more careful in their remarks.\n\n“As a fiscal conservative, I don’t like having the county spending money on things that we shouldn’t have to pay for,” said County Board Chairman Steve Chucri, before pointing out that Arpaio is an elected official.\n\nThe board has no power to remove him, and the county battles of 2008-10 came largely out of the board’s attempt to control Arpaio and Thomas through their budgets. Yet at the same time, the county is responsible for paying Arpaio’s legal expenses, even if it cannot stop the actions that led to lawsuits.\n\nSupervisor Denny Barney raised the same point.\n\n“In my mind, we’ve got the Melendres issue and the DOJ issue, but we’ve got a unique constitutional constraint in this county in that we have an elected sheriff whose budget is set by a board,” Barney said.\n\nTo wit: Sheriffs are appointed in many parts of the country. In recent years, sheriffs in Denver and Philadelphia were removed or resigned after high-money legal settlements.\n\nSupervisor Clint Hickman dodged the question.\n\n“I am going to continue to help a relationship that my district has with (Arpaio’s) command staff and his patrol officers.”\n\nArpaio sees the cost as part of the job.\n\n“When you run a big organization, whether you’re the president of the United States, you will have personnel problems,” he said. “When you run a jail system all these years, and also we run enforcement, when you nail it down, I don’t know if you can say it’s out of line.”\n\nOn June 9, a few days before his 83rd birthday, Joe Arpaio held a party at his headquarters on Jackson Street to celebrate being the longest-serving sheriff in Maricopa County history after 221/2 years.\n\n“It’s really emotional to have survived all these years,” he told the adoring audience.\n\nHe was presented a giant Stetson cowboy hat with the words “Longest Serving Sheriff in Maricopa County History” on the side, and when they sat it on his head, it came down over his ears.\n\nThen he was handed a Smith & Wesson pistol engraved with the words “America’s Toughest Sheriff” and an image of his sheriff’s badge.\n\nState historian Marshall Trimble, who was making the presentations, then said, “He’s got to have a caballo.”\n\n“Do I have to ride it?” Arpaio asked. “Let’s go and say hello.”\n\nOutside, a brown horse with a white face was waiting. Arpaio held the reins and stroked the horse’s face as the cameras whirred and snapped. Then the fans and admirers gathered to take selfies with America’s Toughest Sheriff. (The horse, incidentally, went home with its real owner that night, not Arpaio. It had been another prop for a photo op.)\n\nA reporter stuck a tape recorder in Arpaio’s face and asked, “What do you think your legacy will be?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m not dead yet,” he snapped back, before heading back inside to eat cake.\n\nAnother day, another protest, another demand for his resignation\n\nA month later, there was a different sort of gathering over Arpaio’s legacy.\n\nIn mid-July, a Hispanic activist group called Puente staged a protest asking for Arpaio to resign, marching the eight blocks from the downtown Phoenix Convention Center to the Fourth Avenue Jail.\n\nArpaio locked the jail down hours before the march even began. Defense attorneys gathered a few blocks away, outside the Office of the Legal Defender and the Office of the Legal Advocate, two of the county’s public-defender agencies, wondering why they could not get into the jail to see their clients. They mostly shook their heads as if this were just another day in Maricopa County.\n\nThe march was more than just the usual suspects. Puente organizers took advantage of a gathering of a politically progressive organization called Netroots Nation, which was meeting for its annual conference.\n\nA group of 500 to 600 mostly Anglo and mostly young people stretched for blocks as it marched down Jefferson Street, chanting, “Arrest Arpaio, not the people,” wearing T-shirts that said, “Arpaio-free AZ” or “Adelante (Forward) AFL-CIO.” They carried signs that said, “I have a concentration camp and it’s called Tent City,” and “ICE out of 4th Ave Jail.”\n\nThey were flanked by Phoenix police officers in squad cars, on motorcycles and bicycles, and on foot.\n\nWhen they reached Fourth Avenue, the protesters turned south, where they were met at the jail by fewer than a dozen Arpaio supporters, mostly senior citizens, carrying American flags and holding “We support Arpaio” signs. The marchers circled the block around the jail and then marched on to Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office headquarters a few blocks away.\n\n“Once again, it’s to tell Arpaio to resign,” said Carlos Garcia, from Puente. “We’re here to ask Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get out of there and to shut down Tent City and get justice for Arpaio victims.”\n\nMCSO deputies stood quietly in front of Arpaio’s fortress watching the protesters.\n\nSome soul-searching from inside the Sheriff’s Office\n\nSome protest comes from within the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAt a routine morning meeting in March, Arpaio surprised his deputy chiefs by asking them if they thought he should stay in office.\n\n“Should I run for sheriff — for the seventh time?” he asked them.\n\nIt was more a declaration than a moment of soul-searching as they sat around the giant oblong conference table in Arpaio’s vast office.\n\nThe four deputy chiefs in the room on that March morning agreed that he should stay. Deputy Chief Jack MacIntyre recalls answering, “That’s a decision for you and your wife.”\n\nThe only person in the room with second thoughts was Public Information Officer Lisa Allen, who thought that the strain would be great on Arpaio and his family, especially because of the media.\n\nArpaio’s mind was already made up. “Not that it matters what they answer,” he told me.\n\nBut a month later, another deputy chief, Brian Lee, began circulating a letter asking Arpaio to either resign or stand down for re-election. No one would sign, and Lee was determined to talk to the sheriff himself to tell him it was time to go.\n\n“He spoke with a number of other chiefs, writing things down. ‘You should think about not running again,’ ” Allen claimed he said. “He did say to the sheriff that he felt it was not in his best interests to run again.”\n\nLee went to Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan for advice before talking to Arpaio. Sheridan didn’t want to see the letter Lee had prepared, and he told him to temper his remarks.\n\nArpaio doesn’t remember the conversation going that way.\n\n“He came in when there was a rumor going around,” Arpaio recalls. “He came in to say his opinion.”\n\nThe sheriff paused a moment.\n\n“Maybe some people think I should leave, and I understand that,” he said.\n\nBut his mind is made up.\n\n“Well, I’m running again,” he told The Arizona Republic a week after his longevity party. “It will be my seventh term.”\n\nHe didn’t say that it will be his final term.\n\n“I’m proud of the fact that I’m the longest-serving sheriff in the history of Maricopa County.”\n\n“What would be grounds for stepping down?” I asked, and the question befuddled him.\n\n“If I get shot or something. That would be the only thing that might make me not run. I’m running,” he said. “I’m not going to desert this organization.”\n\nHe did not think he would be forced to resign if found in contempt of federal court for defying a judge’s order to stop enforcing his immigration policies. His contempt hearing before U.S. district Court G. Murray Snow is scheduled to resume Thursday.\n\nRussell Pearce: ‘He’s doing the job we hired him to do’\n\nArpaio still has his supporters.\n\n“If a man is competent and is doing what he promised to do and what he’s supposed to do, then that man should stay in office,” said Russell Pearce, a former state senator and long-time Arpaio ally. “Arpaio is not a young man, but he’s competent, and he’s doing the job we hired him to do, so he should run.”He still has supporters.\n\nBut his popularity is fading. According to a Rocky Mountain Poll this March, the share of people polled who believe Arpaio is doing a good job had fallen to 38 percent. He won the 2012 general election with just 50.7 percent of the vote.\n\n“I think (Arpaio) is vulnerable,” pollster Earl DeBerge said.\n\nAnd the number of naysayers is growing.\n\nHis former self-proclaimed “attack dog,” attorney Dennis Wilenchik, who defended the Sheriff’s Office in the early days of the county battles, said he thinks Arpaio has overstayed his welcome.\n\n“He’s old. He’s not a bad guy personally, but it’s time to go. He’s an embarrassment to the state,” Wilenchik said.\n\n“His ego has gotten so big that even at his toughest time in his career, I don’t think he knows how to back down, how to see he’s wrong. I think we’re seeing the beginning of the end,” Supervisor Steve Gallardo said.\n\nArpaio’s friend, the public-relations guru Jason Rose, agrees with Gallardo to an extent.\n\n“It’s the exception not the rule that elected officials go out on their own terms. There’s a statute of limitations on electability,” Rose said. “Knowing the sheriff like I do, saying ‘I’m sorry’ and admitting things might be the toughest professional thing he’ll ever do.”\n\nRose points out that Arpaio’s enormous campaign war chest may once again save him at the polls. But his advice is to apologize for past mistakes.\n\n“Stare right into the camera and speak directly to the people,” Rose said. “Show a little more humility and a little less hubris, and it might go a long way for him.”\n\nEven Arpaio’s biographer, Len Sherman, wonders if reckoning day is coming for Arpaio.\n\n“You reap what you sow,” Sherman said. “If you’re going to do things the way you want, you might pay the consequences.”\n\nSherman didn’t think that would happen when he wrote the preface of Arpaio’s second book, Joe’s Law.\n\n“We quickly tire of our heroes, probably because they’re not really heroes at all. They appear, they glitter, they are everywhere, and then we learn the truth that they are nothing but false fronts ... (T)hey’re all part of the same media world we inhabit — and they’ve all disappointed us so many times that poll after poll demonstrates that we no longer trust any of our leading institutions.\n\n“And so to Joe Arpaio.”\n\nArizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer did more than three dozen interviews over the past six months and read three books about Arpaio to report on this series.\n\nSince 2003, Kiefer has written more than 320 articles that included Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He has known Arpaio for more than 20 years.\n\nSome of this story is based on Kiefer’s interactions with the sheriff.\n\nKiefer is a senior reporter who has covered courts, justice and Maricopa County government issues for The Republic since 2003. He was part of a team that won The Sidney Hillman Award and Best in the West for coverage of the surge of immigrant children and mothers from Central America.

They plan to walk out again on December 20. (Nurses in Scotland are negotiating a separate pay offer.)\n\nIt’s the first time in its 106-year history that the RCN — the UK’s biggest nursing union — has gone on strike in England. The action has been sparked by a cost-of-living crisis that has slashed nurses’ spending power nearly three years after the start of a pandemic that pushed many to their limits.\n\n“It is pretty unprecedented,” Billy Palmer, senior fellow at Nuffield Trust, a health research firm, told CNN. While small pockets of nursing staff have walked out before, the country’s National Health Service has seen “nothing of this scale until now,” he added.\n\nThat is partly because, for most of its history, the RCN had a “no strike” policy. In 1995, the union changed its rules, allowing strikes as long as they did not compromise patient care.\n\n“Patient safety is always paramount,” the RCN says on its website, adding that some nursing staff would continue to work through the strike. The RCN has promised to maintain critical services, including chemotherapy and dialysis treatments, during this month’s stoppages.\n\nThe nurses join hundreds of thousands of other British workers who are striking this December, including rail staff, postal workers and ambulance drivers. At the center of these disputes is pay, which is failing to keep pace with inflation that hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October.\n\nIt is the broadest wave of industrial unrest since the country’s infamous “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s, when huge numbers of workers, from truck drivers to gravediggers, went on strike.\n\nThe chaos has prompted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to warn that “tough” new laws restricting strike action are on their way.\n\n‘Enough is enough’\n\nEarlier this year, the RCN rejected an offer by the government to increase nurses’ pay by a minimum of £1,400 ($1,707) a year. The offer amounted to an average rise of 4.3%, well below the rate of inflation.\n\nPat Cullen, RCN general secretary and chief executive, said last month that “enough [was] enough,” and that nurses would “no longer tolerate a financial knife-edge at home and a raw deal at work.”\n\nThe union says it wants a 19% pay rise — a 5% uplift on inflation of 14%, as measured by October’s retail price index — and for the government to fill a record number of staff vacancies that, it argues, is jeopardizing patient safety.\n\nThe RCN knows that’s optimistic, Palmer said. Nurses are not “genuinely holding out” for such a increase, he said, but are simply using it as a starting point for negotiations.\n\nBut that demand is “not affordable,” Steve Barclay, the UK’s health secretary, told CNN in a statement. Each additional 1% pay rise for nursing staff would cost the government around £700 million ($854 million), he added.\n\nBarclay said on Twitter last month that industrial action would “inevitably” impact services, but that the NHS had “tried and tested plans in place to minimize disruption and ensure emergency services continue to operate.”\n\n‘Years of underinvestment’\n\nThe dispute has its roots in previous grievances. The 360,000 nurses who work for the NHS — the service’s largest professional group — have suffered from years of underinvestment, the RCN argues.\n\nIn 2010, the Conservative-led coalition government embarked on a decade of austerity to stabilize the country’s finances following the global financial crisis.\n\nNurses’ pay dropped 1.2% every year between 2010 and 2017 once inflation was taken into account, according to The Health Foundation, a UK charity that campaigns for better health and health care. For the first three of those years, their pay was frozen.\n\nDespite pay increases in the years since, the Nuffield Trust estimates that the typical nurse’s salary — around £40,000 ($49,000) for experienced nurses working full time — has fallen by almost 6% after inflation compared to a decade ago. That compares to a 0.6% rise in private sector pay over the same period.\n\nInternationally, it is hard to compare UK nurses’ pay, given health care systems differ significantly between countries, but it falls somewhere in the middle of the range of comparable economies, Palmer said.\n\n“Almost any way you cut it we’re pretty much in the middle, typically [we] look a bit worse than Germany but a bit better than France, and we certainly look worse than the Anglosphere, like Australia and the United States,” he said.\n\nThat is also true for overall spending on the NHS. While the government has increased funding in the past decade, the gains have been “marginal,” according to Palmer. Once inflation and demographic changes are factored in, spending in England has risen by just 0.4% per year since 2010, Nuffield Trust data shows.\n\n‘Emotionally draining’\n\nPay is not the only problem. Nurses are also burned out, partly because there are a record 47,000 vacancies in England.\n\nNuffield Trust data shows that 40,000 nurses in England, or about 11% of the total nursing workforce, quit their jobs in the year to June. A similar number joined — almost 45,000 — but it was not enough to fill the gaps.\n\nMost nurses left to retire, but the number citing work-life balance, the second most common reason to leave, is nearly four times higher than a decade ago.\n\nAnd more could quit if conditions don’t improve. An RCN survey of its members last December showed that 57% of respondents were considering leaving. Feeling undervalued and working under too much pressure were the main reasons given.\n\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King’s Fund, a think tank, told CNN that the past decade had been “challenging” as staff numbers had trailed behind demand. The pandemic only intensified those problems.\n\n“[Nurses were] having to manage the iPad call between someone who [couldn’t] be visited by relatives in their final hours,” Warren said. “[It was] really emotionally draining.”\n\n— Zahid Mahmood contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/09/19/autoworkers-uaw-strike-2023-about-timing/70892990007/", "title": "UAW strike sees workers walk out of assembly plants: Why now ...", "text": "Even if striking United Auto Workers don’t get everything they want, experts say, now is a great time to try.\n\nThe Detroit Three automakers – Ford, General Motors and Stellantis – are generating big revenues and profits, fueled by consumer appetites for pricey, tricked-out trucks and SUVs. A pro-labor president sits in the White House. Public favor for organized labor runshigh, as evidenced by outpourings of support for striking Hollywood screenwriters and actors.\n\n“This is as much about timing as it is about anything. The union sees an opportunity, and they’re trying to use it,” said Susan Schurman, distinguished professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\nShe added, “If not now, when?”\n\nWhy is UAW striking?\n\nAutoworkers walked off their jobs across three Midwest plants at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, staging the first UAW strike in history to target simultaneously three big automakers who have a sizable foothold in Detroit. Workers sought a 40% pay raise (or 46%, depending on how you do the math), a shorter workweek, the elimination of a multitiered wage system and the restoration of a 1980s-style pension plan, among other demands.\n\nThe 40% figure was partly symbolic. Shawn Fain, the UAW president, says the CEOs of GM, Ford and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) have seen their own pay rise by that much in the four years since autoworkers inked their last contract.\n\nExecutive compensation is complicated to calculate, but the three companies' CEOs earn big pay packages. Mary Barra, chief executive of GM, received total compensation of $29 million in 2022, a 34% bump since 2019, according to an AP analysis. Total compensation for James Farley of Ford reached nearly $21 million, 21% more than his predecessor made in 2019. Carlos Tavares of Stellantis took home 23.5 million euros ($25.2 million in today's dollars), a 77% increase over compensation paid to the CEO of Fiat Chrysler four years earlier. Stellantis formed with the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group.\n\nMore broadly, the union wants to draw attention to the profitability of the three automakers. GM earned $10 billion in net profits in 2022. Ford reported increased revenue and earnings, although one-time charges left them with a net loss. Stellantis reaped net profits of almost $18 billion.\n\n'Cheering for the workers'\n\n“I think the overall tenor of the time is that people are cheering for the workers and think that the billionaires, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Elon Musk, are ripping off people,” said Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “I’d say the UAW has exceptional bargaining power.”\n\nThe three automakers were reeling in the Great Recession of 2007-2009 when autoworkers sacrificed much of the pay and benefits they now seek to recover.\n\nToday, automakers are thriving. The average price for a new car topped $49,000 at the close of 2022, compared with $39,000 just three years earlier.\n\nPandemic-era shutdowns and shortages slowed production. Demand outstripped supply. For the first time in recent memory, the auto industry became a seller’s market.\n\nIs now the time to buy a car?High sticker prices, interest rates have many holding off\n\nThe pricier models reap larger profits. Customers are paying more, loading up on teeth-rattling sound systems, futuristic navigation screens, leather seats and other options that push prices beyond what the average American earns in a year. Between 2017 and 2022, the share of new auto sales priced above $60,000 tripled from about 8% to 25%, according to Cox Automotive.\n\n“There’s no question that the automakers can afford to share, fairly, with their workers,” said Seth Harris, a senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University and former labor official in the Biden administration. “They can afford generous wage increases. They can afford cost-of-living adjustments.”\n\nDrive the company into bankruptcy\n\nThe automakers contend they have already offered workers an \"unprecedented economic package,\" to quote a GM release, including \"historic wage increases\" totaling 20%. Farley, the Ford CEO, suggested that meeting the UAW's terms might drive the company into bankruptcy.\n\nAnd there will be economic fallout, starting with the 13,000 striking autoworkers, whose $500 weekly strike pay falls well short of their lost earnings. The impact on the full U.S. economy depends \"very much on how long the strike lasts, and exactly who's affected by it,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday.\n\nA strike by all autoworkers could cost the economy $5 billion after just 10 days, according to an analysis by the Anderson Economic Group, which looked at the estimated impact on workers, suppliers and the wider auto industry. This 5-day-old strike involves about one-tenth of the membership, but Fain has warned that it could easily escalate. The last UAW strike, in 2019, lasted 40 days.\n\nAutoworkers launched their strike knowing they could expect support from President Biden, a Democrat who has called himself history’s most pro-labor president.\n\nFollowing the strike announcement last week, Biden urged the companies to share profits with workers and dispatched aides to Detroit to spur talks.\n\nMore:Donald Trump to skip next GOP debate, plans to meet with striking auto workers in Detroit\n\nThe autoworkers union was “expecting some political help, and they’re already getting it,” said Raymond Gibney Jr., an associate professor of management at Penn State Harrisburg.\n\nPublic support for labor unions stands near a half-century high. Sixty-seven percent of Americans approve of labor unions in 2023, according to an August Gallup survey of 1,014 adults from every state.\n\n“The polls show that people are more pro-union now than they’ve been in decades,” said Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, a professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University in Bloomington.\n\nLabor's big year\n\nLabor has had a big year. In July, UPS and the Teamsters reached a landmark deal to avert a massive strike. Workers won higher wages and the end of a two-tier pay system, among other concessions.\n\nThe American public broadly supports striking Hollywood screenwriters, who walked out in May over pay, job security and other concerns, and the actors who followed in July.\n\nCelebrities who have dared to cross picket lines have faced swift backlash. Over the weekend, actress Drew Barrymore reversed a plan to resume her talk show in the face of withering criticism.\n\nThen again, the writers' strike hasn’t appeared yet to inconvenience the American viewer, who can fill Drew Barrymore’s silence by streaming old “Suits” reruns. The walkout unfolded in an era of seemingly limitless film and television content as well as a wealth of video content on social media platforms from Instagram to TikTok and YouTube.\n\nSee the picket lines:UAW launches a strike, targeting big three Detroit automakers\n\nWhat if cars don't show up at dealerships?\n\nThe UAW strike encompasses only about 13,000 of the nation’s 146,000 autoworkers. If it drags on, consumers could see shortages of vehicles within several weeks, raising already-high prices at a time when car buyers are paying more to borrow. And then, they might look harder at the union’s audacious demands.\n\nWhile the public largely supports the autoworkers, Dau-Schmidt said, “If we have a big strike and cars stop showing up at dealerships, people may change their minds.”\n\nAsking for more than one expects is standard practice in negotiations. Fain, elected on a promise to get tough on the three automakers, proffered a list of demands so bold, some experts say, that he risks alienating the pro-labor public.\n\nThe union is asking for more money for less work, a weekly schedule shortened to 32 hours.

They’re not going to get the 46% wage increase that they first asked for.

Two rail unions on Wednesday announced further strike action by 14,000 of their members later this month.\n\nMore strikes could be on the way this fall, threatening unprecedented disruption across a range of industries. Teachers, doctors and nurses are set to vote on strike action in the coming weeks. Unions could even coordinate their walkouts. Unite and Unison — the country’s biggest unions with 2.7 million members in total — are calling for others to join them in synchronized action.\n\nIt is one of the most significant waves of industrial unrest the United Kingdom has seen since the “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s when rampant inflation pushed workers to stage mass walkouts. About 7.9 million working days were lost between November 1978 and February 1979, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nAbout 40,000 cleaners, signalers, maintenance workers and station staff walked off the job in June in Britain's biggest and most disruptive railway strike for 30 years. Matt Dunham/AP\n\nSoaring prices and years of stagnant wages are the backdrop to this year’s disputes. Consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 10.1% in July. Forecasters at Citigroup said last week that inflation could shoot past 18% at the start of next year, and Goldman Sachs thinks it could even hit 22% if gas prices don’t fall soon.\n\nWorkers are already feeling the strain. Average real wages, which account for inflation, fell by 3% between April and June, compared with the same period last year. That was the biggest hit to spending power in more than 20 years. Real wages barely increased in the decade to 2020.\n\nAnd average household energy bills — which have already risen 54% this year — are set to increase by another 80% to £3,549 ($4,124) in October. According to estimates by Auxilione, a research firm, average bills could hit £7,700 ($8,949) next April — equivalent to a £642 ($746) monthly bill.\n\nWorkers are mobilizing in response.\n\n‘Demoralizing’\n\nThe United Kingdom has “never seen [this] level of disruption across all sectors,” Chiara Benassi, an associate professor in comparative employment relations at King’s College London, told CNN Business.\n\nIn recent months, the cost-of-living crisis has acted as a “trigger” for widespread grievances that have been building up over a long period of time, she said.\n\n“These strikes affect not only [what] we would say [are] manual occupations or low-skilled jobs that more evidently would struggle with the cost-of-living crisis, but also highly-skilled jobs like junior doctors, British Telecom engineers, barristers, academics, teachers,” Benassi said.\n\nBT workers on strike over pay on August 30 in London, England. Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n\nDeepsha Agrawal, a junior doctor at Oxford University Hospital, told CNN Business that her colleagues are pushing for a bigger pay increase than the 2% the government agreed back in 2019.\n\n“It’s quite demoralizing, because the current inflation rate is expected to go very high next year,” she said.\n\nHer union, the British Medical Association, will soon ballot its members over whether to strike. Agrawal believes that they will. Many of her colleagues feel they cannot afford to buy houses or have children.\n\n“[Junior doctors] are as hardworking and as educated as other professionals. We are struggling and we are paying a price out of our pocket to do the work that we do,” she said.\n\n“With what happened during Covid, we should be rewarded for what we did, not punished for what we do every day,” Agrawal added.\n\nFewer union members\n\nThe current wave of industrial action cannot easily be compared to the 1970s and 1980s — if only because the government stopped tracking numbers of striking workers, and working days lost, during the Covid-19 pandemic. It recently started collecting data again, and will provide an update this month.\n\nRichard Hyman, a professor of industrial relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN Business that this years’ strikes would pale in comparison to those of earlier decades simply because union membership has fallen so dramatically.\n\n“Around about 1980, more than half the workforce was in a trade union. Today it’s less than a quarter, so there’s been a big decline,” Hyman said.\n\nStrikes used to be concentrated in sectors which have “more or less disappeared” like coal mining and steel, Hyman added. Now, union membership is more heavily skewed towards the public sector, or big utility companies that used to be owned by the government.\n\n“There’s been the rise in precarious work, so that a growing proportion of workers simply don’t have a proper job any more so are not in a position to go on strike,” Hyman added.\n\nBenassi said that during the 1980s, when UK manufacturing industry was shrinking rapidly, strikes were often about the survival of key sectors.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, thousands of coal miners went on strike after Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government threatened to close many of the country’s coal pits.\n\n“[Today] it’s a bit different, because we are talking only about pay. Of course, the disputes at the time were also about pay but it was also about, for example, not closing down the mines,” she said.\n\nMore restrictions coming?\n\nThis year’s strike wave is significant, though, for the breadth of industries affected and because of the hoops UK workers have to jump through to down tools legally.\n\n“Striking in the UK is very difficult. It’s way more difficult than anywhere in western Europe, especially after the Trade Union Bill in 2016,” she said.\n\nThe legislation, which came into force in 2017, made it much harder for unions to call a strike by requiring at least 50% of members to take part in the ballot, and at least 40% of the votes cast to be in favor of strike action. The law also increased the period of notice unions must give employers of their intention to strike from one week to two.\n\nIn comparison, Benassi said that neither a ballot nor a notice period are required in Germany.\n\nLiz Truss, UK foreign secretary and favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister next week, has said she would bring in even tougher limits on unions’ powers to call a strike.\n\nWaste overflows from bins during a strike by workers in Edinburgh, Scotland, on August 27. Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nShe has proposed raising the support threshold for strike action from 40% to 50% of votes cast, and extend the notice period to a month.\n\n“I will take a tough line on trade union action,” Truss told Sky News in July.\n\nLiz Truss’ leadership campaign declined to comment when contacted by CNN Business.\n\n“There’s quite an adversarial campaign from the side of the government to say well we’ll send agency workers to replace the workers on strike, or they should go back to work immediately, or there has already been a pay rise,” Manuela Galetto, associate professor of employment relations at the University of Warwick’s Business School, told CNN Business.\n\nDespite the obstacles, workers may feel more emboldened to strike at the moment, given the tight labor market, she said.\n\nUK unemployment was 3.8% between April and June this year, ONS data shows. That’s its lowest level in more than 50 years.

But two UAW local leaders who are on that council told the Free Press it is likely that even after that council vote, workers could remain on strike until membership ratification.

Download our app for the latest news. ]\n\nA source close to GM bargainers expressed concern at the possibility, saying a prolonged strike is bad for the company and for the workers. Analysts have said the production stoppage alone is costing GM $50 million-$100 million a day.\n\nLikewise, strikers will earn just $250 in strike wages each week and will have to have medical expenses reimbursed through COBRA. In addition, thousands of workers with GM suppliers have been temporarily laid off because of the strike, and GM's Oshawa, Ontario, plant has been idled, with some 4,000 workers temporarily laid off due to a parts shortage from the strike.\n\nRemaining on strike until a tentative agreement is approved is not unprecedented, said two labor experts, who recalled workers staying on strike in 1970 until the entire rank-and-file approved the new contract.\n\nAs of Sunday morning one of the main sticking points in talks was GM's refusal to allow temporary workers to receive profit sharing payouts and to create a pathway for them to become permanent workers. Two people familiar with the talks said that is one of about five key issues the parties remain stuck on.\n\nMore:Sources: GM offers 2% raises to UAW; company ends strikers' health care\n\nMore:How GM's profit sharing offer to UAW workers missed the mark\n\nElizabeth Warren visit\n\nOn the picket lines at Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose presidential campaign has seen a boost in recent polling, grabbed a “UAW on Strike” sign and joined picketers Sunday during a visit to Detroit.\n\nHundreds of union members and supporters came to catch a glimpse of the Massachusetts Democrat as she marched with strikers and sounded a strongly pro-union message.\n\nShe blasted GM, saying the company’s announcement last year that it would “unallocate” five plants in North America shows it has no loyalty to the workers or the people of America. She said that if the company could “save a nickel” by moving jobs to Mexico or elsewhere, it does so. Warren said it’s good to be with UAW workers who want to hold the company accountable.\n\n“They want a contract here that keeps these jobs in America,\" she said. \"They want a fair wage. They want benefits. They want what it takes to be part of America’s middle class and they want the same for themselves and for temporary workers. Everybody deserves a living wage in this country. When unions win, all American workers win.\n\n\"Let’s be clear, unions built America’s middle class, and unions will rebuild America’s middle class,” Warren said, sparking chants of “UAW” from the crowd.\n\nGM said it would not comment \"regarding any specific commentary by the politicians today ... except to say that our goal remains to reach a tentative agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.\"\n\nWarren was asked about a new Iowa Poll showing her in first place among the crowded Democratic field, but she said, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”\n\nDennis J. Laubernds was among those who came to see Warren. He carried a sign, reading “Temp Lives Matter,” that noted his position as a GM temporary worker since 2013. The St. Clair Shores man works at the Orion Assembly plant on the line.\n\nWhile he said the people with whom he works at Orion are nice, the 64-year-old noted that working as a temporary worker means less pay and fewer benefits. Before being laid off with the rest of his shift at Warren Transmission in 2017, he was making $21 per hour. When he came back to work this April at Orion, his pay was $15.78 per hour. He said GM is “making out like a fat cat” paying him at that rate.\n\nExpedited ratification\n\nBesides the people who described the union's thinking on the idea of waiting until ratification to end the strike, picketing workers and some other local leaders said they had heard of the possibility.\n\nTommy Wolikow, a UAW worker at GM's Flint Assembly, said he has heard that he and other strikers would remain on the picket line until the entire membership approved a deal and that makes sense to him. If members did not ratify it, it would be difficult to walk off the job again to go back on strike.\n\n“Until the membership approves the agreement, I was told we’re not going back to work,\" said a UAW worker at GM's plant in Bedford, Indiana, who asked to not be named.\n\nWhen the UAW's National Council reconvenes in Detroit to vote on a tentative agreement, whenever it comes, it will likely also vote to either end the strike or stay on strike until GM's 46,000 workers across its 55 facilities in the United States approve the deal, say those familiar with the process.\n\nIf the council does vote for the strikers to stay off the job until the entire membership votes, the UAW leaders can expedite the ratification process beyond the typical two weeks it takes under normal circumstances, said Marick Masters, business professor at Wayne State University who specializes in labor.\n\nMasters said the tactic makes sense from the union's standpoint.\n\n“One of the worst things they could have happen is to send the workers back to work and then they do not ratify,\" said Masters. \"Then where would their bargaining leverage be?”\n\nIt also is a show that UAW leadership is including its members in the contract negotiation process and meeting rank-and-file demands.\n\n\"It’s my understanding that they’ve been engaging the rank and file through their subcommittee negotiations to make sure that whatever tentative agreement they come up with, they can say it is percolating from the membership, not being dictated by the leadership.\"\n\nMany observers say the ongoing federal corruption investigation of the union, which has reached top leadership with a search of UAW President Gary Jones' home, erodes trust of leadership and could complicate ratification.\n\nThe minute they withdraw the leverage a strike gives the union, the harder it is to return to the bargaining table if the UAW needs to sweeten the deal. For example, in 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles workers rejected a tentative agreement.\n\n“The rejection was unexpected, but when it happened, UAW’s then-President Dennis Williams (who also is implicated in the corruption scandal) went back to Chrysler and they sweetened it slightly and then it was approved,\" said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who studies labor.\n\nThis strike is much longer, going on a full week, and it's a bit of unchartered territory, Shaiken said.\n\n\"There are a significant number of workers hired post-2007 who have never been out on a real strike, but you’ve got a real strike right now,\" said Shaiken. \"I think the union wants to be sure there’s a buy-in before everybody goes back to work.”\n\nBlocking an agreement\n\nThere five to six key sticking points in negotiations, according to two people familiar with the talks.\n\n\"They made some gains, but GM is saying a hard no to a few things,\" said a UAW local chairman familiar with the talks and who asked to not be identified because he is not authorized to speak for the union.\n\nEarlier in the week, one of those issues was the fate of GM's idled-plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The plant made the Chevrolet Cruze compact car until March when GM \"unallocated\" product to it and stopped the line. GM has said three other U.S. plants will be indefinitely idled including Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren and Baltimore transmission plants.\n\nThe union wants more details on how a promised $7 billion in GM investments over a four-year contract would be allocated to solve Lordstown's fate. GM has indicated a battery cell manufacturer could go there. And GM is still in talks with a group headed by electric-truck maker Workhorse, to buy another part of the plant.\n\nBut some close to the talks said the battery cell manufacturer could be a joint-venture and offer a separate UAW contract for workers, likely at lower pay rate than the GM contract. This is problematic, said three people familiar with the UAW's thinking, because in a decade or so, if battery cells replace traditional engines, gone are those higher-paying UAW jobs, replaced by the lower-paid jobs in the separate contract.\n\nThen, as of Sunday morning, a big sticking point was temporary workers. The UAW wants to have a path for the temps to become permanent employees and share in GM's profit sharing.\n\nAlso, GM is reluctant to reduce the number of years a lower tier wage person, known as \"in-progress\" worker, has to work to reach the higher wage scale. It's currently eight years.\n\n\"GM's stubborn about the temps – they still get no profit sharing in the last proposal GM made,\" said the chairman. \"They still don’t want the temps to have the piece of it and they want to keep the temps language in there meaning, GM can keep them temps as long as they want.”\n\nA GM spokesman declined to comment on the status of the talks or sticking points, other than to say, \"Talks continue.\"\n\nHere are some key differences between temporary workers, \"in-progression\" workers and permanent workers, according to the UAW:\n\nTemporary workers wages: $15-$19.\n\nA newly hired permanent production worker, called \"in progression,\" makes about $17 an hour, and can rise to $28 an hour after eight years.\n\nA legacy worker earns $28 to $33 an hour.\n\nA skilled trades worker, about 15% of the Detroit Three's workforce, is closer to $35 to $36 an hour. They often get heavy overtime.\n\nProfit Sharing: Temps get none\n\nInferior health care coverage for temps\n\nNo supplemental pay during layoffs and plant retooling\n\nLess paid time off\n\nNo retirement pay\n\nNo Seniority rights\n\nPermanently temporary\n\nShaiken said GM's reluctance to make its temporary workers permanent and give them profit sharing is not surprising.\n\n“It has little to do with flexibility and everything to do with a rock-bottom wage that will reduce GM’s costs,” said Shaiken.\n\nBut like many temporary workers and the union argue, it's hard to accept still being classified as a temporary worker if a person has worked in that job for several years.\n\n\"Those are workers who have no track to get better, they’re simply working hard, at rock bottom wages. That flies in the face of the very soul of the UAW.” said Shaiken. “What this indicates right now is that these rock-bottom wage workers are not a temporary moment to get through a crisis, this is a way of doing business.”\n\nBut it's no secret that changing the workplace composition, which includes the ratio of temps to permanent workers, has been a GM priority. Currently about 7% of GM's U.S. hourly workforce are temporary employees and GM would like to increase that. One person close to the talks said, \"If health care remains the same, then something has to give to make this piece of the pie work.\"\n\nIn its initial offer to the UAW, GM had proposed workers pay 15% of the costs for health care. The union rejected it and GM backed down, leaving it at the current 3% to 4%.\n\n\"If GM has given everything back on health care, clearly they’ve retreated on how much the workers pay from 15% to 3%,\" said Shaiken, making it likely GM is not going to bend on the issue of temporary workers. Which means a settlement could be a bit off because of that critical issue.\n\n\"The temp language would be very hard for the union to swallow in part because GM wants to expand the percentage of temps. They averaged 7% this year, that’s considerable,\" said Shaiken. \"You have rename this group permanent temporary workers because that’s what they are. This could be a far larger hang-up than GM supposed.\"\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau at 313-222-2149 or jlareau@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @jlareauan.

UAW strike will force Biden to 'pick a side'", "text": "Joe Biden, who has built his presidency around pandering to labor unions, launched his 2020 campaign by saying: “I make no apologies. I am a union man. Period.”\n\nHe has also claimed that he’s the “most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history.”\n\nIn return for his pledged support, unions donated generously (more than $27 million) to help get him into the White House.\n\nNow they expect Biden’s undying loyalty in return. That fealty is facing its ultimate test this week as the United Auto Workers threatens the largest strike in the union's history.\n\nIf Detroit's Big Three automakers don’t meet the union’s outrageous pay and benefit demands by Thursday, the roughly 150,000 members are set to go on strike – a move that would be unprecedented.\n\nGiven the ripple effects on the nation’s economy and automotive production, a strike would strain Biden’s role as labor’s guy in the Oval Office.\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group estimates that a 10-day strike on all three automakers “could result in a total economic loss of more than $5 billion.”\n\n“It would be extremely economically significant,” says Steve Delie, director of labor policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. “It could be potentially more devastating than strikes in the past.”\n\nBiden overtime pay law doesn't add up:Biden's overtime pay proposal is the last thing our economy needs. Employers must speak up.\n\nBiden told by union boss to 'pick a side'\n\nDespite their cozy relationship, tensions are running high between Biden and the UAW. Last week, Biden ticked off UAW President Shawn Fain when he said he didn’t think a strike was going to happen. Fain fired back in an interview on CNBC, saying it’s time for “politicians in this country to pick a side.”\n\nContract negotiations between Fain and Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis face a Thursday night deadline, and so far, offers by the companies have faced a hard “no” from the union.\n\nThe UAW is demanding a 46% pay hike over four years, a 32-hour work week (for full pay), the end of a tiered pay system for newer workers, as well as the return of pensions and retiree health care. It’s a big ask, and the union doesn’t seem interested in giving in on any of its demands.\n\nSuch significant increases in salaries and benefits would put the Big Three in an extremely uncompetitive position with foreign competitors and Tesla. If the UAW gets everything it wants, workers could earn about $100 an hour in total compensation – roughly twice what their nonunionized counterparts make. Even now, UAW workers make more an hour than the competition.\n\nThe negotiations come at a time when the Biden administration, driven by climate change zealotry, is forcing the U.S. auto industry to retool itself quickly for an electric vehicle future through new emissions standards.\n\nUAW leadership has expressed concern about the administration’s aggressive goals and how it could affect members.\n\nThe transition to electric vehicles also poses a much less certain future for Detroit automakers as they move away from the cars and trucks that continue to be profitable to invest in new technologies.\n\nIn other words, it’s not a great time, amid the upheaval in the industry, to force the automakers’ hand on costly pay and benefits.\n\nThat’s not making Fain shy away from his demands – nor his expectation that Biden act as a cheerleader.\n\nIs this a union resurgence?\n\nGiven all the attention unions have received in recent months – and the support of Biden and Democratic governors – it may seem like unions are gaining in power. The Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes are ongoing, and other unions have threatened to walk off the job.\n\nThe numbers tell a different story, however. Union membership continues to fall, and unionization in the United States reached its lowest rate (10.1%) in 2022, according to government statistics. That rate has fallen by half since 1983, the first year for which comparable data's available.\n\nRight-to-work laws, which give workers a choice about joining unions and paying dues, have been enacted in more than half the states, and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld right to work for all public-sector employees.\n\nRight to work:Michigan posts 'closed for business' sign to please unions. Biden wants the same for US.\n\nDemocrats, however, don't want workers to have that choice. Biden is pushing federal legislation that would overturn right-to-work laws across the country.\n\nAnd Michigan, where the UAW battle is taking place, recently overturned its decade-old right-to-work law, under the guidance of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. That will help boost unions' coffers and has no doubt contributed to the UAW's bold demands.\n\nIf the strike happens, it will hurt an already-faltering economy plagued by the lingering pain of inflation – an issue that is one of Biden’s largest shortfalls among voters. Consumers also will notice if new- and used-car prices spike as a result of a strike – or eventually because of sky-high worker wages and benefits.\n\nThe question remains: Will Biden side with powerful union bosses? Or will he do what's best for the country?\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

We are the victims here, being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" she said. \"They stand on the wrong side of history. We stand in unprecedented unity. At some point the jig is up, you can’t keep being marginalized and disrespected. The business model has been changed by streaming and AI. If we don’t stand tall right now, we’ll all be in jeopardy. At some point you have to say, no, we’re not going to take this anymore.\"\n\nActors strike live updates:'Shame on you!' says emotional SAG chief Fran Drescher\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2, holding out for improved payment contracts at a time when less-than-lucrative streaming deals are bumping up against the looming threat of artificial intelligence taking writers' jobs. Actors are also looking for better pay deals, especially from streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nThe strike caps a month of tense negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the major studios. On June 28, an open letter from more than 1,000 SAG members was sent to the union's leadership. The letter, signed by Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and other big stars, expressed the membership's sincere willingness to strike if they were not able to achieve all demands in a new contract.\n\nBoth sides had already extended talks by 12 days after their initial contract expired June 30.\n\nThe combined SAG and Writers Guild of America strikes mean the immediate shutdown of any TV show or movie currently in production, and includes promotional appearances ranging from red carpet walks to media junkets. While the duration of the strike is an unknown, some reports suggest studios are willing to hold out into the fall to win concessions.\n\n\"The studios are consolidating in a bid to compete with Netflix, the only one who seems ready for Hollywood's fully digital era,\" says Aymar Jean Christian, associate professor of communication studies and director of the Media and Data Equity Lab at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The streaming model is making the studios both more powerful and cost-conscious,\" he says. \"This will be a grind. Unless the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers) gives in quickly, which seems unlikely, this could be the longest production slowdown in history.”\n\nFor their part, studios shifted blame for the strike to actors for walking away from talks and said \"historic\" pay increases and other benefits had been offered. In a statement, the AMPTP said, \"This is the Union’s choice, not ours. ... Rather than continuing to negotiate, SAG-AFTRA has put us on a course that will deepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their livelihoods.\"\n\nExplainer:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows\n\nThis marks the first time in 63 years that both Hollywood actors and writers have been on strike simultaneously. Commercial actors last walked off the job for six months in 2000, while the last strike by film and theatrical actor members of SAG lasted 14 hours, back in 1986. The writers staged a 100-day walkout in 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe ongoing Writers Guild strike has meant that many TV shows and movies have had to cancel production, although animation (minus voice actors), reality TV and some projects shooting outside the U.S. with actors who aren't in SAG have been able to carry on. But with an actors' strike, very little can continue.\n\nFor movie theaters, already facing an uphill climb after the pandemic and a shift to at-home viewing, it means another big financial challenge after they're run through their supply of already-shot movies.\n\nStrike rules forbid actors from promoting their projects, a constraint writers have faced since May. That means no premieres, no talk show appearances and no glossy magazine cover stories that aren't already banked. (USA TODAY's interviews with actors for upcoming movies such as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were conducted before the strike began.)\n\nThe strike will also depress the fun at fan favorite events such as San Diego Comic-Con, usually chock-full of popular actors, writers and directors pitching their movies and TV shows to thousands of cosplaying admirers.\n\nThe Emmy Awards, planned for Sept. 18 on Fox, would likely be delayed until both strikes are resolved. If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), other major awards shows like the Oscars would be put on hold.\n\nThe actors will join the writers on picket lines at a transformational moment in the entertainment industry. The WGA is asking for a guaranteed minimum number of writing staffers, increased royalties for streaming TV shows and movies, and the regulated use of AI. Actors share many of the same concerns and demands.\n\nThe studios reached a deal with a third major Hollywood union, the Directors Guild of America, that was ratified by its membership on June 24. But that settlement did not move the writers or actors toward an agreement with the studios.\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt, USA TODAY\n\nA movie fan's guide to the strike:Wait, will 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' come out?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2018/04/19/arizona-educators-vote-redfored-walkout-teacher-pay-ducey-proposal/531028002/", "title": "Educators vote on whether to walk out as #RedForEd movement ...", "text": "Arizona educators and school employees fueling the teacher-led #RedForEd movement have voted in support of a walkout — an unprecedented action aimed at pressuring state leaders to act on their demands for more education funding.\n\nLeaders of the Arizona Educators United grassroots group and the Arizona Education Association announced the results of their walkout poll late Thursday.\n\n\"We are underfunding our students,\" said AEU organizer and teacher Noah Karvelis. \"We are throwing away an entire generation of students' opportunity of academic success.\"\n\nKarvelis said they will continue non-disruptive walk-in demonstrations on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and then walk out Thursday.

They framed their announcement as an ultimatum to state lawmakers: Address their demands by Thursday, or teachers will start walking out.\n\nThe organizers said they were confident school superintendents and school boards – both of whom would play a crucial role in the walkout’s sustainability – would support their effort.\n\n“We are truly in a state of crisis right now.” Karvelis said.\n\nParents, teachers, school boards and superintendents have remained on edge in recent weeks as educators intensified their discussions over whether to walk out of schools as their colleagues have recently done in West Virginia and Oklahoma.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey commented on the news via Twitter: \"No one wants to see teachers strike. If schools shut down, our kids are the ones who lose out. We have worked side by side with the education community to develop a sustainable plan to give teachers a 20 percent raise by 2020.

They withdrew their support Wednesday, saying the state doesn't have the revenue to support the proposal.\n\nRELATED: Save Our Schools, Arizona PTA drop support for teacher pay-raise plan\n\nMixed feelings from teachers\n\nTeachers and school staffers flooded the private Arizona Educators United Facebook page, which has nearly 48,000 members, with differing opinions.\n\nMany educators remained adamant in their support for a walkout, an enthusiasm that's been apparent since the early-March eruption of the #RedForEd movement.\n\nOthers believe that while Ducey's proposal does not address all of the demands educators have laid out, it is a good starting point.\n\nThey argued a walkout endangers the overwhelming public support teachers have mustered to push for the restoration of $1 billion in cuts to education funding since the recession.\n\nTeacher vote participation\n\nThe AEU group and AEA distributed ballots via union representatives and Arizona Educators United \"site liaisons,\" who are primarily teachers who volunteered to serve as the movement's point of contact for their schools. The 1,000-plus liaisons make up the communications system for the #RedForEd movement.\n\nBut hundreds of district and charter schools across the state did not appear to have any AEU or AEA representatives.\n\nRELATED: As Ducey touts support for teacher pay plan, some push back on details\n\nInternal documentation from the Arizona Educators United group showed about 70 Arizona school districts — many of them single-school districts in the state's rural pockets — did not have a site liaison.\n\nNearly 500 of the state's 550 charter schools did not appear to have a site liaison listed in the group's documents.\n\nTeachers in the Osborn, Kyrene and Chandler school districts told The Arizona Republic ahead of Thursday’s vote that several of their educators appeared split on the question of whether to walk out.\n\n“We have a range of teachers — teachers who were ready to walk out last week, and teachers who are scared to wear a red shirt,” said Alexis Aguirre, a teacher at Encanto Elementary School in Phoenix. “Our teachers are mothers and fathers, as well.

That will mark its seventh and final painful hike of the year, albeit a smaller one than the last four historically high three-quarter point increases.\n\nBut the main event at December’s meeting will be the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated Summary of Economic Projections and what’s known colloquially as the dot plot. Investors will be paying close attention to these forecasts for clues about the path of rate hikes in the new year and beyond. They’re worried that they’ll show a more aggressive monetary policy tightening path, indicating that more hikes are coming next year.\n\nWhat’s happening: At the end of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting this week, the central bank will release its economic outlook. That forecast, which is updated four times a year, includes a chart which plots out an array of dots, showing where each of the Fed’s 19 leaders expect interest rates to go in the future.\n\nFormer Fed chair Ben Bernanke first created the dot plot in 2012, mostly as a way to assure the public that Fed leaders planned to keep interest rates low for the time being. Now the opposite is true, the dots have become a signal that interest rates will remain elevated into the future — spooking investors and Fed watchers alike.\n\nThe problem is that it’s difficult to predict what the future actually holds. As economic data changes, so do Fed projections.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last year that “the dots are not a great forecaster of future rate moves,” and that they should be taken “with a big, big grain of salt.” But that doesn’t stop investors from reading into them.\n\nDot-plot madness: The dot-plot release could take a bite out of market sentiment this week, even as investors cheer an easing of rate hikes.\n\n“We think the markets are too sanguine on rates after the first quarter and we expect Powell to take a more hawkish tone and for the dots to indicate higher rates for a longer period of time than what is currently being priced in by the futures markets,” wrote Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth in a recent note. “A ‘hawkish’ step-down so to say.”\n\nThe question is how big of a jump will there be in the dots. Back in December 2021, the Fed was only expecting rates to finish this year at about 0.9%.\n\nIn a note on Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect the median “dot” to rise to a new peak in Federal fund rates of 5%-5.25%, up from 4.5%-4.75% in September. That would mean Fed officials expect to raise rates by half a percent more than they did three months ago, when the plot was last released.\n\nWhat else: Wednesday will also bring the Fed’s latest forecasts for the unemployment rate and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Those numbers will highlight whether Fed officials think recession is likely and how high their tolerance for pain is as they continue the fight to bring down persistent inflation.\n\nEconomists at EY-Parthenon believe that projections for real GDP growth will likely be revised down from 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to around 0%. Unemployment rate projections, they say, will likely approach 5% (from 4.4% in the September update).\n\nThe Federal Reserve announces its rate hike decision Wednesday at 2 p.m., followed by a press conference with Powell at 2.30 p.m.\n\n‘Unprecedented’ strike: 100,000 UK nurses set to walk off the job\n\nAs many as 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing will walk out across England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday in the first of two days of strikes this month to protest poor pay and working conditions. They plan to walk out again on December 20, reports my colleague Anna Cooban.\n\nIt’s the first time in its 106-year history that the RCN — the UK’s biggest nursing union — has gone on strike in England. The action has been sparked by a cost-of-living crisis that has slashed nurses’ spending power nearly three years after the start of a pandemic that pushed many to their limits.\n\n“It is pretty unprecedented,” Billy Palmer, senior fellow at Nuffield Trust, a health research firm, told CNN. While small pockets of nursing staff have walked out before, the country’s National Health Service has seen “nothing of this scale until now,” he added.\n\nThat is partly because, for most of its history, the RCN had a “no strike” policy. In 1995, the union changed its rules, allowing strikes as long as they did not compromise patient care.\n\n“Patient safety is always paramount,” the RCN says on its website, adding that some nursing staff would continue to work through the strike. The RCN has promised to maintain critical services, including chemotherapy and dialysis treatments, during this month’s stoppages.\n\nThe nurses join hundreds of thousands of other British workers who are striking this December, including rail staff, postal workers and ambulance drivers. At the center of these disputes is pay, which is failing to keep pace with inflation that hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October.\n\nIt is the broadest wave of industrial unrest since the country’s infamous “winter of discontent” in the late 1970s, when huge numbers of workers, from truck drivers to gravediggers, went on strike.\n\nThe chaos has prompted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to warn that “tough” new laws restricting strike action are on their way.\n\nTesla: Our ‘failure’ to make actual self-driving cars ‘is not fraud’\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said numerous times since 2015 that Tesla cars would be entirely self-driving in two years, or less. But years after his self-imposed deadlines have blown by, it still hasn’t happened. Even when equipped with a $15,000 technology package that is literally called “Full Self Driving Capability,” a Tesla car can’t actually drive by itself, reports my colleague Peter Valdes-Dapena.\n\nNow, lawyers for Tesla are arguing that while the company may have failed to live up to these lofty goals, that doesn’t mean it perpetuated a fraud, as alleged in a class-action lawsuit filed in September.\n\n“Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,” Tesla’s lawyers wrote in a November 28 court filing, asking that the suit be dismissed.\n\nThe lawsuit cited numerous times when Musk and others at Tesla had stated that, within a year or two, the cars would be fully self-driving thanks to software updates. For instance, in a 2016 Tweet, Musk stated that a Tesla car would be able to drive itself across the United States “by next year,” the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the California firm of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, also cited numerous cases of crashes involving the use of Tesla’s driver assist technology.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/07/26/dwayne-johnson-sag-donation-actors-strike/70468175007/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson donates millions to SAG for actors amid strike", "text": "Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson has made a \"historic\" seven-figure donation to SAG-AFTRA to provide assistance to union actors on strike.\n\n\"While we cannot disclose the amount, as it is a private donation, we can confirm that it is seven figures, and it is historic for our nonprofit organization,\" SAG-AFTRA director of communications Caroline O'Connor tells USA TODAY in a statement Tuesday.\n\nJohnson's donation is the largest total contribution received from an individual donor in the union's nearly 40-year history.\n\nThe wrestler-turned-actor's donation \"will help thousands in urgent need who have been impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike, and will receive emergency assistance for basic needs,\" O'Connor added.\n\nJohnson has yet to comment on his donation.\n\nHollywood actors voted to strike earlier this month, joining already-striking writers in a move that shuts down the production of countless movies and TV shows.\n\n\"I went in in earnest, thinking we could avert the strike, so the gravity of this move is not lost on me,\" Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher said on July 13 at a news conference in Los Angeles announcing the strike.\n\n\"We had no choice. We are the victims here, being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" she said. \"They stand on the wrong side of history. We stand in unprecedented unity. At some point the jig is up, you can't keep being marginalized and disrespected. The business model has been changed by streaming and AI. If we don’t stand tall right now, we’ll all be in jeopardy. At some point you have to say, no, we’re not going to take this anymore.\"\n\n'We are the victims here':Hollywood actors strike, shutting down the film, TV industry\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2, holding out for improved payment contracts at a time when less-than-lucrative streaming deals are bumping up against the looming threat of artificial intelligence taking writers' jobs. Actors are also looking for better pay deals, especially from streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nThe combined SAG and Writers Guild of America strikes immediately shut down TV shows and movies currently in production; it has already delayed “Challengers, ” starring Zendaya, which had been set to debut at Venice International Film Festival but has now been pushed to 2024.\n\nThe strike terms also halt promotional appearances ranging from red carpet walks to media junkets. While the duration of the strike is an unknown, some reports suggest studios are willing to hold out into the fall to win concessions.\n\nWriters strike 2023 explained:Why the WGA walked out, what it means for TV and film\n\nThis marks the first time in 63 years that both Hollywood actors and writers have been on strike simultaneously. Commercial actors last walked off the job for six months in 2000, while the last strike by film and theatrical actor members of SAG lasted 14 hours, back in 1986. The writers staged a 100-day walkout in 2007 and 2008.\n\nContributing: Kelly Lawler and Marco della Cava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}]}

Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - have signaled a variety of approaches in recent days.\n\nHere's a look at what each challenger needs to do and is trying to do to defeat Trump:\n\nDeSantis: Trump will 'sell you out' on abortion\n\nDeSantis, who needs to at least hold onto second place in the months ahead, has begun arguing in recent days that Trump is going soft on a major issue for religious conservatives: Abortion.\n\n“I think all pro-lifers should know that he’s preparing to sell you out,” DeSantis told RadioIowa.\n\nDeSantis - and other Republicans - are criticizing Trump for comments urging the party to talk about the abortion issue in a different way because otherwise it could hurt them in general elections.\n\nTrump, who supports exceptions in cases of rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother, also attacked a DeSantis-backed law in Florida banning abortions after six weeks, calling it a \"terrible mistake\" politically.\n\nDeSantis may also use the debate to argue that Trump is taking the nomination fight, and the voters, for granted.\n\n\"I think the former president believes he's entitled to be nominated,\" DeSantis told KCCI News. \"He's not doing the work it takes to really earn people's votes.\"\n\nHaley and the 'disliked' Trump\n\nThe goal of the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is to maintain the momentum from her well-reviewed performance in the Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee.\n\nThis time around, Haley is likely to cite a recent CNN poll showing her as the Republican most likely to defeat President Joe Biden in a general election. Other post-debate polls show her catching up to DeSantis for second place.\n\nHaley may also echo her most-quoted line from the Milwaukee event: \"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America. We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nPence, Trump and 'populism'\n\nThe former vice president will likely continue stressing contrasts with the former president who put him on the Republican ticket back in 2016.\n\nIn preparing for the debate, Pence made a high-profile speech in which he attacked Trump-style \"populism\" that stresses \"personal grievances and performative outrage\" over traditional conservative principles.\n\n“Should the new populism of the right seize and guide our party, the Republican Party as we have long known it will cease to exist,” Mr. Pence said during the heavily promoted speech in New Hampshire, site of the first Republican primary.\n\nRamaswamy: Take Trump's agenda 'even further'\n\nThe young businessman, who is running his first political race, is taking a unique approach to the campaign and the debate: He's trying to \"out-Trump\" Trump with \"revolutionary\" proposals that would give the president sweeping powers to eliminate a raft of federal agencies and employees.\n\nOn a pre-debate interview on Fox News Sunday, Ramaswamy said his \"core focus\" is to \"take the America First agenda even further than Donald Trump did.\"\n\nPresidents don't have the power to do many of the things Ramaswamy is proposing, but his plans and unique foreign policy proposals drew attention to him after the first debate − and criticism from other Republican candidates that is likely to be repeated in the second debate.\n\n“He wants to hand Ukraine to Russia, he wants to let China eat Taiwan, he wants to go and stop funding Israel,\" Haley said in Milwaukee, telling Ramaswamy: “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows.”\n\nAsked about the criticism, Ramaswamy told Fox: \"The reality is many people are annoyed by my rise and believe that a 38-year-old is too young to be U.S. president.\"\n\nChristie: Trump's legal problems are the issue\n\nThe former New Jersey governor has been the most outspoken Republican candidate about what some call this campaign's \"elephant in the room\": Trump faces up to four criminal trials next year.\n\nGrand juries in Washington, D.C., Georgia, New York, and Florida have indicted Trump in connection with efforts overturn his loss of the 2020 election, a hush-money scheme, and obstruction of justice in the handling of classified information.\n\nWhile Trump seeks to delay these cases until after the election, Christie said the charges will render him unelectable in a general election.\n\n\"Trump has no one to blame but himself,\" Christie said on social media platform X. \"His conduct is the cause.\"\n\nChristie has also attacked Trump for dodging debates.\n\nScott needs more time\n\nScott, who has become stagnant in the polls, is also warming up for the debate by hitting Trump on abortion.\n\n\"President Trump said he would negotiate with the Democrats and walk back away from what I believe we need, which is a 15-week limit on the federal level,\" Scott said during an event in Iowa.\n\nScott's main objective at the California debate: Get more air time.\n\nKall noted that Scott spoke for only around 8 minutes during the Milwaukee event, not enough to make a big impression.\n\n\"The debate learning curve is steep, but time is running out with only a few more debates available before voting begins in Iowa,\" Kall said.\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Doug Burgum try to make the stage\n\nHutchinson and Burgum, two other candidates who debated in Milwaukee, have a more basic challenge next week: Qualifying for the second debate.\n\nAt this point, Hutchinson and Burgum aren't polling high enough to meet the requirements set by the Republican National Committee.\n\nAnother candidate, former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., did not qualify for the first debate and probably won’t qualify for this one.\n\nTrump in Detroit\n\nThe former president will be a spectral presence at the California debate - he will certainly come up during the discussion.\n\nTrump is also scheduling a competing event, a trip to the Detroit area to speak with union members in the battleground state of Michigan.\n\nHis goal for the evening: Divert attention from his Republican rivals.\n\nA 'careful dance'\n\nIf the candidates use this debate to step up critiques of Trump, they'll need to do with care.\n\nCandidates have to draw contrasts with Trump without alienating his considerable number of loyalists - and without giving him free publicity in the process.\n\nSaid Mair: \"There's a careful dance to be done here.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/14/what-to-know-about-republican-presidential-debate-hosted-in-milwaukee-how-long-format-questions/70566198007/", "title": "What time does GOP presidential debate on Fox News, livestream ...", "text": "MADISON - Milwaukee will host the first Republican presidential primary debate Wednesday night.\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is skipping the event, eight other candidates have qualified and take the stage.\n\nHere's what we know about the debate format and who will appear onstage.\n\nMore:How to watch the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee\n\nMore:What you need to know about the Aug. 23 Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate will last around two hours. It will begin at 8 p.m. Milwaukee time and wrap up around 10.\n\nWill candidates give opening statements?\n\nCandidates won't give opening statements, though they will have 45 seconds for closing remarks, according to the format details obtained by Semafor.\n\nHow long will candidates talk?\n\nCandidates will have one minute to answer a question and 30 seconds for follow-up questions.\n\nWhat kind of debate is it?\n\nAll signs point to the first debate in Milwaukee following a traditional format, where candidates answer questions from moderators.\n\nOther types of debates include the town hall, during which candidates take questions from audience members. Candidates may also speak at forums that are hosted by private organizations, not political parties.\n\nWho will ask the questions?\n\nFox News anchors Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier are co-moderating the debate.\n\nSemafor reported that some of the questions will involve \"sound or video, including pre-taped questions submitted by students\" through the Young America's Foundation, which is a partner of the debate.\n\nThe group, which organizes young conservatives, is headed by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans are trying to make inroads with college-age voters, who have overwhelmingly turned out for liberals in recent statewide elections.\n\nHow many questions will be asked?\n\nIt's not clear at this point whether each candidate will have a chance to answer every question, or if candidates will be asked separate, specific questions about the issues.\n\nAt the early Republican primary debates in 2016, questions were posed to individual candidates about issues like abortion and foreign policy. For the first few debates, so many candidates ran that the group was split and debates were aired separately. Twelve debates and nine forums were held during the Republican primary that cycle.\n\nWhat is the 'spin room'?\n\nCandidates or their campaign representatives also make themselves available after the debate to meet with reporters and attempt to \"spin\" their performances.\n\nReporters and networks may conduct and air interviews from the spin room after the main debate event wraps up.\n\nWho will be onstage?\n\nWhile Trump plans to skip the debate and instead participate in an online interview with Tucker Carlson, eight other candidates have qualified and will appear onstage.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nTim Scott\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nChris Christie\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nMike Pence\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nCandidates will be placed onstage according to polling, with the highest polling candidate in the center.\n\nA few other candidates failed to meet the requirements, including Texas Rep. Will Hurd, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and radio host Larry Elder. Candidates had until 48 hours before the debate to meet the criteria.\n\nDo candidates need to sign a pledge?\n\nYes. Those who attend the Milwaukee debate must sign a series of pledges, including a promise to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nSome candidates, including Christie and Hutchinson, have criticized the pledge or suggested they won't follow it. Trump said Wednesday he wouldn't sign the pledge in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nIs this the only Republican debate?\n\nNo. The Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee is only the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. Fox Business will host a second debate Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\nThe qualifications to participate in that debate are tightened from the Milwaukee debate. A candidate will need 50,000 individual contributors, up from 40,000. A candidate also needs to poll at least 3% in two national polls or one national poll and two early-voting state polls, up from 1%.\n\nIn addition to letting voters hear from candidates about issues and allowing them to compare choices, debates also give candidates trailing in the polls opportunities to break out.\n\nMore debates will likely be announced ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which takes place July 15-18, 2024. Fiserv Forum will be the centerpiece of the convention, and the site of the debate.\n\nWill the candidates attend a town hall?\n\nMoms for Liberty, designated as an extremist antigovernment organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center, had planned a town hall with unnamed presidential candidates earlier on Aug. 23. That event has since been canceled.\n\nThe group will instead host a discussion with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson that afternoon at the Pfister Hotel, which will focus on Wisconsin students' proficiency in reading and math.\n\nTyler Katzenberger of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/20/republican-candidates-second-gop-debate/70899716007/", "title": "Here are the Republican candidates who made the second GOP ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — All eyes will be on the field of Republican presidential candidates as they hit the stage for the second GOP primary debate next week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute - but not every presidential hopeful will be on stage.\n\nThe requirements for the second debate in in Simi Valley, California, have a higher threshold than the first event. Candidates must have a minimum of 50,000 unique donors and poll at least 3% in two national polls or 3% in one national poll and 3% in one early state poll from two “carve out” states recognized by the Republican National Committee.\n\nThey must also have signed the “Beat Biden” pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it's one of their political rivals. The deadline to qualify for the debate is Sept. 25.\n\nSix candidates will likely hit the stage in California – a dip from the eight who qualified for the first GOP debate in Wisconsin last month.\n\nGOP frontrunner and former President Donald Trump said he would skip the debates, citing his large lead in polls. He instead plans to visit the Detroit area to speak with striking auto workers.\n\nHere’s who's' expected to appear at the debate next week.\n\nWho has qualified for the second GOP debate?\n\nSo far, six candidates appear to have qualified for the second debate:\n\nDuring the upcoming debate, Republican voters will likely be watching to see whether candidates boost their prior debate performance, or avoid traps from the last event.\n\nFor example, DeSantis didn't take swings at Trump during the first debate, but he could take aim at the Republican frontrunner next week.\n\nRamaswamy is also expected to be center stage again over his lack of political experience and recent controversial comments on Ukraine aid, ending H-1B visas and more. He is likely to have back and forth skirmishes with Pence, who has called for more traditional conservatism and has repeatedly said “this no time for on the job training.”\n\nWith Haley surpassing Pence in some national polls after her performance during the first GOP debate, she will likely face more attacks from her rivals in the upcoming event. A recent poll from CNN found that Haley would have the best chance of beating Biden in a hypothetical match-up.\n\nScott, who didn’t have a breakout moment at the first debate, is seeking a placement change on stage, according to Axios, likely trying to garner more buzz with his performance. Christie is expected to bring his anti-Trump perspective to the stage while also relying on his experience as a former prosecutor to talk about Trump’s indictments.\n\nWho hasn't qualified for a spot on stage?\n\nThe two candidates who don’t appear to have qualified yet are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nBurgum said he is “fully confident” he will qualify for the second debate in an interview last month. While he has met the donor threshold, he may still need to clear polling hurdles.\n\nHe has 0.2% of support in Republican primary polls, according to an average calculated by Real Clear Politics. However, a Politico analysis found that Burgum has reached at least 3% in one state poll.\n\nMeanwhile, Hutchinson said in an interview with KHBS-TV that he is close to making the second debate.\n\n\"My goodness, I think we had almost 4,000 new donors just on the night of the debate from all over the country,\" he said, referring to the first GOP debate. He also said he made three percent in one national poll and he’s going to keep “marching on.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/republican-gop-debate-live-updates/70653558007/", "title": "Republican debate recap: Highlights as GOP candidates face off", "text": "Eight Republican presidential candidates battled Wednesday over Ukraine, abortion and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as they gathered in Milwaukee for their first primary debate of the 2024 cycle.\n\nWith frontrunner Donald Trump absent, Vivek Ramaswamy took a lot of heat, with Mike Pence calling him a \"rookie\" and Chris Christie attacking him as an \"amateur.\"\n\nAs other candidates criticized Ramaswamy’s lack of experience, the Republican entrepreneur said his business background was a better asset to lead a \"revolution” and pitched himself as some who could offer a new generation of leadership.\n\nNikki Haley ripped into Ramaswamy for saying that the United States should cede eastern Ukraine to Putin. “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” she said.\n\nTrump’s name finally came up about an hour into the debate: The candidates were asked : Would you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\nWould you support Trump if he is convicted?

Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov.

Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen.

Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn’t need a president who’s too old, or a president who’s too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n“We need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,” Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n“There’s a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,” she said, later adding, “Parents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.”\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: “The job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he’d freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy “if we do the giveaway that you want to” and give Putin eastern Ukraine, “it's not going to be too long” before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did – though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would’ve done what he did.\n\n“Answer the question,” Pence said.\n\n“Mike did his duty,” DeSantis responded. “I’ve got no beef with him.”\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, “not grudging credit.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump’s two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence’s exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don’t support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a “pro-life” candidate, but there isn’t a uniform standard.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn’t having it.\n\n“Nikki, you’re my friend,” Pence said, “but consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n“It’s a moral issue,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in − and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‘A guy who sounds like ChatGPT’\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn’t hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here…” Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n“The last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n“This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,’” Haley said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,” Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he’ll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn’t having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n“The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,” she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n“You tell me who are the big spenders,” she said. “I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won’t spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n“Fight it out,” Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‘I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves’\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire’s crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n“I’m open to hearing somebody change my mind,” said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n“I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves,” Biel said, adding he’s open to “people who I disagree with.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n– Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‘softball’ interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a “softball” interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n“In his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he’s running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his “broken promises” to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely “double down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court’s decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n− Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis’ political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president’s record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump’s campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n“President Trump has already won this evening’s debate because everything is going to be about him,” Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n“In fact, tonight’s Republican undercard event really shouldn’t even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump’s team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there’s a good chance they’ll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire “Ending Inflation” plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week “three hours of solid debate prep” – to the basketball courts – North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O’Donnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy” in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he “will share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.”\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate − advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that’s where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the “most dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war” and said it’s clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, “but if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.”\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan – but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for “some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson’s campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren’t accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n“I am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,” Suarez wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates’ position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n“Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,” Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn’t the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‘as much as I can’ of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight’s Republican primary debate.\n\n“I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes,” Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. “I have none,” he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden’s reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme “MAGA” Republican Party.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. “You can’t stop the Trump Train,” senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon “walk through” said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n– Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024.

Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence,businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have also claimed to have qualified for the debate stage, but the RNC would only announce the final lineup on Tuesday.\n\nThey all have plans and possible pitfalls, even the nondebating Trump:\n\nDonald Trump: The man who won't be there\n\nPlan: The former president is gambling that his absence will drain attention – and television viewers – from the other candidates, rendering their debate a nullity. He is discussing the possibility of counterprogramming the debate by holding an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nPitfall: The other candidates get free shots at Trump, who faces four criminal trials and other legal proceedings that will distract him throughout the 2024 campaign. Don't forget: During the 2016 campaign, Trump skipped a debate in Iowa – and lost that year's caucuses to Ted Cruz.\n\nRon DeSantis: Stay in second place\n\nPlan: Use the debate to promote his record in Florida and reestablish himself as Trump's main competitor.\n\nIn recent months, DeSantis has seen his percentage of the Republican vote fall from the mid-to-low 20s to below 15%, according to the average of recent polls compiled by the Real Clear Politics website. DeSantis has slipped to third place in some individual polls, a development that Trump and his allies have harped upon.\n\nPitfall: DeSantis is not considered a good debater. A poor performance in the spotlight on Wednesday would open the door for one of others to emerge as Trump's top challenger.\n\n\"This strikes me as very make-or-break for DeSantis,\" said Republican political consultant Liz Mair. \"He has no real room for error.\"\n\nDeSantis allies said they fully expect the Florida governor to be the most attacked candidate during Wednesday's debate, just as he has been Trump's main target throughout the campaign.\n\n\"Every candidate on and off the debate stage will have their knives out for Ron DeSantis because they know this is a two-man race,\" DeSantis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said. \"If DeSantis wasn't the best candidate to beat Joe Biden, Donald Trump wouldn't have spent over $20 million attacking him.\"\n\nMike Pence: Pick up ground on Trump - and DeSantis\n\nPlan: The former vice president, touting his experience with the \"Trump-Pence administration,\" is one of the many candidates hoping to use the debate to move up against Trump – and DeSantis.\n\nPitfall: Pence is unable to break through the enmity of Trump supporters who still attack him for refusing the former president's demand to overturn the 2020 election, for which Trump is facing criminal trials in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.\n\n\"I always stood loyally by Donald Trump until my oath to the Constitution required me to do otherwise,\" Pence said Friday during a candidate forum in Georgia. \"But my differences with the president go far beyond that fateful day ... And I hope to have a chance to debate them with him.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Introducing himself\n\nPlan: Ramaswamy and supporters see him as the hot new thing in Republican politics, an outsider businessman who wants to shake up the system; they hope the debate can further that image and elevate him to second place behind Trump.\n\nIn a statement on the debate, the Ramaswamy campaign said that \"Vivek's job on Aug. 23 is to introduce himself and his vision to the American people.\"\n\nPitfall: The 38-year-old is new to prime time, and may face first-time attacks during the debate. DeSantis allies have urged him to challenge Ramaswamy over his lack of experience.\n\nNikki Haley: Hang on until South Carolina\n\nPlan: Haley hopes to elevate herself in the polls by stressing her experience in domestic and foreign policy affairs, as a former governor of South Carolina and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nThe only woman in the race is looking to keep her head above water in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary in January, and play for the late February primary in her home state of South Carolina.\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News, Haley said the debate will \"jump start\" the presidential race.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for the American people to see what their options are,\" Haley said. \"And it's the start of the season.\"\n\nPitfall: No breakout, and Haley stays mired in the low single digits.\n\nTim Scott: Also hang on until South Carolina\n\nPlan: Scott, the other South Carolinian in the Republican presidential race, is well liked by many segments of the Republican Party. He, like Haley, is expected to promote himself as part of a new generation of GOP leadership.\n\nThe only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate, Scott is also considered a running mate possibility for Trump or whoever else can capture the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nPitfall: Scott is seen more as a potential vice president than a president.\n\nAgain, like Haley, Scott also needs to do reasonably well in Iowa and New Hampshire in order to get to the South Carolina primary.\n\nChris Christie: Trump should be nervous\n\nPlan: Some memorable Jersey-style wisecracks during the debate about Trump's failings that resonate for months. The former New Jersey governor has made attacking Trump the focus of his campaign that is based mostly in New Hampshire.\n\nChristie is also the candidate who has made the most noise about Trump's likely absence.\n\n“If I had his record, I’d be nervous about showing up, too,\" Christie told reporters after his appearance at the Republican conference in Atlanta.\n\nPitfall: Republicans continue to rally around Trump over his four indictments, believing that opponents are using the legal system to attack him and the Trump movement politically.\n\nDoug Burgum: Getting to know you\n\nPlan: The North Dakota governor, whose campaign offered donors $20 gift cards for $1 donations, sees the debate as a chance to promote his economic and energy agenda - and to build name recognition.\n\nPitfall: Voters will continue to say, \"Doug Who?\"\n\nAsa Hutchinson: 'Speaking the truth' about Trump\n\nPlan: The former Arkansas governor, who has struggled to collect a sufficient number of donors, said Sunday he has qualified for the first debate. The former federal prosecutor who has called on Trump to withdraw from the race said he will \"continue speaking the truth when it comes to the responsibility that Donald Trump bears for the attacks on our democracy and justice system.\"\n\nPitfall: Not many Republican voters will listen.\n\nThe other candidates\n\nThe Republican National Committee is expected to announce Monday the full line-up of candidates who have qualified for the debate, based on donor numbers and poll results.\n\nLesser known Republican candidates are eager to hit the stage and try to boost name recognition.\n\nPerry Johnson: The Michigan businessman claims he has qualified for debates because of recent polls that put him at 1% or more. Pitfall: \"Perry who?\"\n\nWill Hurd: Like Christie and Hutchinson, the former congressman from Texas has attacked Trump over his legal problems and said he is running for president again simply in order to \"stay out of prison.\"\n\nFrancis Suarez. The mayor of Miami says he has enough donors to qualify for the debate, which he wants to devote to his own campaign.\n\n“From my perspective, I want to spend as little amount of time talking about the former president\" as possible, he told The Associated Press. \"He’s capable of handling himself, defending himself.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/17/first-gop-presidential-debate-aug-23/70405173007/", "title": "First GOP presidential debate: Here's a rundown of who will qualify", "text": "WASHINGTON - As the 2024 presidential election heats up, Republicans vying for the White House are preparing to face off during the first GOP primary debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee − the largest city in the key battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nBut who will qualify for a spot on stage?\n\nThe Republican National Committee set forth requirements in June that candidates must meet on status, polling, fundraising and pledging to take part in the debate.\n\nHow it works: Candidates must poll at least 1% in three national polls or 1% in two national polls and 1% from an early state poll from two “carve out” states recognized by the committee.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCandidates must also have a minimum of 40,000 unique donors part of their presidential campaign committee - with at least 200 unique donors per state - and sign a pledge agreeing to support the eventual party nominee.\n\nWhile top candidates in the Republican primary polls have qualified for a spot, other lesser-known candidates are struggling to make headway. Some candidates have refused to participate altogether.\n\nHere are the candidates who are on track to qualify for the first debate:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nTim Scott\n\nChris Christie\n\nHere are the candidates still working on qualifying:\n\nMike Pence\n\nWill Hurd\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nLarry Elder\n\nHere’s a deeper rundown of which Republican hopefuls might make an appearance − and which ones might not − on debate night.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump − the GOP frontrunner − will qualify for the debate.\n\nA survey from Morning Consult shows Trump has 56% of support from potential GOP voters, and he’s placed first in other national and state polls. His campaign said that he has also raised more than $35 million during the second quarter of the year - about twice the amount raised during the first quarter, Politico first reported.\n\nBut whether Trump will participate is still up in the air.\n\nTrump threatened to skip the debate in late June claiming on Truth Social that Fox News, one of the event’s sponsors, ignored his campaign events. He suggested to Fox News host Bret Baier on his show \"Special Report\" last month that he didn't want to spar with low-polling candidates.\n\n\"They're all very low,\" Trump said. \"So why would I allow people at one or two percent, at zero percent, to be hitting me with questions all night? You know, I don't think it's fair.\"\n\nHe's also considered scheduling a competing event for that night, according to NBC News.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s trailing behind Trump in the Republican primary polls, will hit the debate stage.\n\nHis campaign announced he raised more than $20 million during the first six weeks of his candidacy and has about 50,000 donors as of late June, according to the New York Times. The survey from Morning Consult shows that DeSantis has garnered 17% of support among potential GOP voters.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview two weeks ago with Fox News host Will Cain he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\n“I hope everybody who's eligible comes,” DeSantis said. “I think it's an important part of the process and I look forward to being able to be on the stage and introducing our candidacy and our vision and our leadership to a wide audience.”\n\nLast month, DeSantis dodged the question of whether he would support Trump if he becomes the nominee in 2024. However, DeSantis later said that he didn’t avoid the question and would \"respect the outcome of the process,\" according to The Hill.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nFormer Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on track to meet the requirements for the debate.\n\nHaley’s spokesperson told USA TODAY that she has “well over 40,000 unique donors” and is “looking forward to being on the debate stage.” The New York Times reported she’s raised over $7.3 million through her campaign and affiliated committees between April and June.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows she has registered 3% of support among GOP voters, which is on par with two of her rivals. She’s also maintained scoring above 1% in other polls.\n\nHaley indicated on Twitter she plans on supporting the eventual nominee for the Republican party.\n\n“Absolutely irresponsible that Trump, DeSantis, and others won't commit 100% to supporting the Republican nominee,” Haley tweeted. “There’s no room for personal vendettas in this battle to save our country.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has fulfilled the debate criteria, according to his spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\nMcLaughlin told USA TODAY that Ramaswamy has 65,000 donors. As part of his fundraising strategy, Ramaswamy has laid out incentives for supporters such as offering to give them a 10% cut of the total money he raises for his presidential bid, according to Axios.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Ramaswamy has received 8% support from GOP voters, surpassing former Vice President Mike Pence and trailing behind DeSantis. He’s also starting to receive double-digit figures in some polls.\n\nRamaswamy will take the loyalty pledge if the other candidates do, McLaughlin said.\n\nMike Pence\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who filed to run for president last month, is facing difficulty meeting the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has gained 7% support among voters, trailing behind Ramaswamy, and he's maintained over 1% support in other polls. However, the New York Times reported last week he has not yet received donations from 40,000 unique donors.\n\nHe’s also raised less than $1.2 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year − far below what his rivals have raised, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDespite announcing his candidacy late compared to his rivals, Pence − a familiar face among voters − has already garnered attention from voters as he campaigns across key states and maintains a critical position against Trump’s stances on abortion, immigration, criminal justice and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nPence said in a CNN town hall last month in Iowa he would support whoever ends up being the Republican nominee in 2024.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott said during an interview last month on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” that he's met the requirements for the debate.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he’s scored 3% support among GOP voters, and he’s also maintained an average 3.2% of support in the Republican primary polls, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nScott’s campaign told the New York Post they’ve been backed by 40,000 donors in early July and announced Wednesday that they’ve raised $6.1 million in the second quarter of fundraising, according to The Hill.\n\nScott indicated in a Fox News interview in May he will support the eventual nominee, saying “all Republican candidates would be better than any Democrat candidate.”\n\nChris Christie\n\nFormer Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has qualified for the debate.\n\nHe told CNN host Anderson Cooper on Wednesday he’s received more than 40,000 unique donors in just 35 days. He’s taken in fundraising from big donors such as Motorola Solutions CEO Greg Brown and Lewis Eisenberg, who was a former ambassador to Italy during the Trump administration, according to CNBC News.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he garnered 3% of support among voters − on par with two of his rivals − and has scored above 1% in other polls. Although his poll numbers are not as high as Trump's or DeSantis', he appears to be gaining momentum as a fierce rival against his running mates.\n\nLast month, Christie called the loyalty pledge a “useless idea” on CNN’s “State of the Union” but said he will do what is needed to be on the debate stage. In an ABC News interview, Christie said he will take the pledge “as seriously as Donald Trump did eight years ago,” when Trump signed the pledge but refused to agree to back the eventual nominee.\n\nWill Hurd\n\nFormer Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd is working to fulfill the debate requirements, according to his campaign spokesperson.\n\n“Will entered the race only a few weeks ago, but he fully intends on fulfilling the polling and donor thresholds,” a Hurd for America spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, the survey from Morning Consult shows Hurd received 0% of support among GOP voters, and he’s not included in some polls. He encouraged his followers on Twitter to donate $1 to support his campaign in late June so he could fulfill the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe spokesperson said Hurd won’t sign the loyalty pledge from the Republican National Committee.\n\n“This is not about whether or not he’ll support the Republican nominee, it’s about refusing to support Donald Trump,” the spokesperson said.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nWealthy Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is taking several steps to meet the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Burgum has received 0% support among GOP voters, but he has reached 1% in certain national or state polls, according to The Hill.\n\nBurgum reported raising $11.7 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year last week, but about $10.2 million of that amount was self-funded, according to NBC News.\n\nHis campaign is offering a $20 gift card to anyone who donates at least one dollar, and the offer lasts for the first 50,000 donors. Experts, however, have raised questions over the legality of this method, according to NPR.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is struggling to fulfill the debate criteria.\n\nHe's attracted crowds of no larger than 50 people to his Iowa events, according to the Des Moines Register. He also told radio host Hugh Hewitt in early July that he has more than 5,000 donors and has more work to do to reach the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has 1% support from GOP voters and a polling average of 0.8%, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nDespite his low numbers, Hutchinson told ABC News in May he is in the race for the long haul and that his support among voters will expand.\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nTexas business executive Ryan Binkley is working towards fulfilling the debate requirements, according to a campaign spokesperson.\n\n\"Ryan is engaged in a major ad blitz and canvassing effort to be able to qualify for the debate,\" his spokesperson told USA TODAY. \"He is winning over supporters and donors everywhere he and his digital footprint go.\"\n\nBut his name doesn't appear in most national polls or the survey from Morning Consult. He has also raised $2 million for his campaign overall - $1.8 million of which he self-funded, according to Forbes.\n\nBinkley's spokesperson said he is close to 5,000 donors and expects \"to exceed that by the end of the Turning Point Action conference.\"\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nRepublican Miami Mayor Francis Suarez might not qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nBut his spokesperson, Soledad Cedro, told USA TODAY Suarez' campaign is three weeks old and he will be on the debate stage.\n\nSuarez tweeted on Friday that his campaign committee had raised $1 million and will meet the criteria for the first debate, though he didn't specify how many donors he has. Suarez's major setback, however, are his low polling numbers.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult show he's received 0% support from GOP voters, and he has a polling average of 0.1% according to data from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nSean Freeder, a political science professor at the University of North Florida, previously told USA TODAY Suarez will have a difficult time leveraging himself as the top candidate given his late entrance and competition with two high-profile candidates from Florida.\n\nLarry Elder\n\nConservative commentator Larry Elder is unlikely to qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nHis campaign referred USA TODAY to an opinion piece he wrote for The Hill, in which he criticized the debate requirements and said he is running for president to give back to the country rather than serving “as a piggy bank for a political party.”\n\nHowever, he said in an interview with News Nation last month that he will work hard to meet the criteria.\n\nHe’s not included in the survey from Morning Consult, but data from RealClearPolitics shows he has a polling average of 0.5%.\n\nHis campaign spokesperson declined to say how many donors he has, but said Elder is \"optimistic\" he will reach 40,000.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/19/biden-campaign-hits-trump-for-planning-to-skip-milwaukee-debate/70632470007/", "title": "Biden campaign hits Trump for planning to skip Milwaukee debate", "text": "MADISON – President Joe Biden's campaign on Friday accused former President Donald Trump of wanting \"to avoid appearing in Wisconsin\" as it seems likely the current Republican frontrunner will skip the first GOP presidential primary debate in Milwaukee next week.\n\n\"Of course Donald Trump wants to avoid appearing in Wisconsin because he knows Wisconsin is a state that illustrates his failed leadership,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe campaign referenced Foxconn Technology Group’s project in Racine County that had promised 13,000 new jobs and had been touted by Trump but ultimately never came to fruition.\n\n\"Wisconsinites soundly rejected his ongoing efforts to ban abortion in the state’s Supreme Court election earlier this year,\" Munoz added. \"He cannot hide from the fact that Wisconsinites rejected him in 2020, and will reject the MAGA agenda again in 2024.\"\n\nMore:Janet Protasiewicz sworn in as Supreme Court justice, ushering in an ideological shift\n\nThe attack comes as Trump appears to be taking a pass on attending the debate, instead planning to participate in an online interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, according to news reports. The decision from the former president would end months of speculation as to whether he would be on stage in Milwaukee on Wednesday, though Trump has previously hinted he would not attend.\n\nOn his social media website Truth Social on Thursday, Trump noted that he is polling far ahead of his Republican rivals, writing of the debate: \"Reagan didn't do it, and neither did others. People know my Record, one of the BEST EVER, so why would I Debate? I'M YOUR MAN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nMore:Do other Republicans have any chance against Trump? Here's what early polls can tell us.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump in a statement to the Journal Sentinel did not confirm whether Trump plans to skip the debate. \"We look forward to debating the failed policies of a weak and failed Joe Biden — if he can get out of his basement long enough,\" the campaign said.\n\nDemocrats plan to use the Wednesday debate to attempt to paint Republicans as extreme and tie other candidates on stage to the former president as part of a sweeping media blitz. Officials from both the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee will be on the ground in Wisconsin engaging with voters.\n\nThey will post three billboards around Milwaukee ahead of the debate that will attempt to contrast \"the MAGA agenda with Biden’s record of accomplishments,\" according to Biden's campaign. Another mobile billboard truck will circle Fiserv Forum, the debate venue.\n\nTrump's apparent decision to skip the debate is a shot to both the Republican National Committee, which is organizing the debate, and Fox News, which will moderate the event. Both organizations had pushed Trump to attend in recent weeks. His decision also comes on the heels of his fourth criminal indictment — this time from a prosecutor in Georgia who accused Trump of leading a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMore:The indispensable state: Why Wisconsin could again be the electoral 'tipping point' in 2024\n\nStill, Trump is expected to have an impact on the debate.

Here's what's getting more expensive ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing, but food prices are still through the roof.\n\nFood costs spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAmericans browsing the supermarket aisle will notice most food items are far more expensive than they were a year ago. Egg prices soared 39.8%, while flour got 23.3% more expensive. Milk rose 17% and the price of bread jumped 16.2%.\n\nMeat and poultry also grew costlier. Chicken prices jumped 16.6%, while meats rose 6.7% and pork increased 6.8%. Fruits and vegetables together are up 9.4%.\n\nOverall, grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8%.\n\nEgg prices have soared over the past year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nWhy there’s no relief at the grocery store\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to tame inflation, but the central bank says that food prices are largely out of its control.\n\nThat’s because food prices are affected by global events, such as the war in Ukraine, which affects the costs of wheat and other commodities. Prices also reflect the impact of natural disasters like crop-killing droughts and diseases such as avian flu, which has constrained the supply of eggs and turkeys.\n\nPlus, it takes time for changes, such as decreases in ingredient prices, to funnel down to consumers. That means that relief from the surge grocery prices could lag declines in other areas.\n\nAnd demand for food isn’t flexible — consumers may be able to skimp on other items, such as clothing or gasoline, but they have to eat. Even so, shoppers are increasingly making changes to their diets and shopping habits to cope with rising costs.\n\nPeople are pulling back on certain items. Sales of frozen dinners and entrees have fallen about 11% by volume in August compared to the year prior, according to a report this week from IRI, a market research company. Cookie volumes and volumes of refrigerated juices fell nearly 9% and about 8%, respectively, in that period. Lower-income households in particular are skipping items like juice, snacks and candy.\n\nRecently, Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers, who may be trading down from more expensive restaurants. And Tyson (TSN) has noticed higher demand for chicken as shoppers buy fewer pricey steaks.\n\nWhat got more expensive\n\nThe seasonally adjusted prices of most grocery items ticked up from July to August, but there were some standouts.\n\nMargarine spiked the most, up 7.3%. Eggs were 2.9% more expensive and sugar was 2.4% higher, while flour and bread edged up 2.2%. Canned fruit prices rose 3.4% while fresh vegetables got 1.2% pricier.\n\nHot dog prices jumped 4.9%, while ham was up 1.3% and turkey rose 2.2%.\n\nSome meat prices fell, however. Bacon was .5% less expensive, while the price of pork roasts, steaks and ribs fell 1.9%.\n\nAnd some fruit prices moderated as well, with apples getting 2.3% cheaper and citrus fruits falling 1.6%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/business/dairy-farmers-food-inflation/index.html", "title": "Milk prices: Why you could be paying 50% more this year | CNN ...", "text": "Prices are rising at the fastest pace in decades, creating a cost-of-living crisis that’s forcing people around the world to make tough choices about what to buy.\n\nThe United Kingdom is no exception: inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% in April and is forecast to peak above 10% toward the end of this year. The high cost of fuel and heating is just part of the problem. Food prices have also leaped, climbing nearly 7% compared with a year ago, according to data released Wednesday.\n\nA big part of the problem is the soaring price of dairy products. The cost of milk, cheese and eggs — supermarket staples — shot up 9.5% in the 12 months to April. The price of whole milk rose more than 12%.\n\nIn the United States, wholesale milk prices jumped 38% last month year-over-year, while the retail price of fresh whole milk was up 15%.\n\nThere could be more pain to come, according to a recent analysis by Kite Consulting, which specializes in the UK dairy industry. Between 2020 and 2021, a standard four-pint carton of milk cost between £1.10 ($1.36) and £1.20 ($1.49). This year, it could reach £1.70 ($2.11), the consultancy said. That would mark an increase of more than 50% from the bottom end of the range.\n\nWhy the dramatic spike? It partly comes down to supply and demand. Covid-19 drove up the price of many goods as lockdowns distorted global supply chains. This weighed on milk production, as farmers dealt with more expensive fertilizer and animal feed as well as new environmental rules. Meanwhile, the appetite for dairy products, especially in developing countries, grew during the recovery.\n\nThen came the invasion of Ukraine, which further scrambled access to products like wheat, fertilizer and fuel, hiking costs for dairy farmers once again.\n\n“The war is the thing that’s causing the major problem at present,” Kite Consulting managing partner John Allen said.\n\nA customer shops for food items inside a Tesco supermarket store in east London. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe price of fertilizer\n\nOne of the biggest problems is the spiking price of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which are essential to dairy farming.\n\n“If you look at April 2022 compared to April 2021, you see fertilizer prices almost four times where they were before,” Robert Craig, who runs three dairy farms in northern England with about 1,500 cows.\n\nIf farmers cut back on how much fertilizer they use, they can’t grow enough grass to feed their cows while they graze. A recent lack of rain in England is making the problem even worse.\n\nJessica Langton, who helps run a family farm in Derbyshire with 100 cattle, is concerned.\n\n“We get the majority of our income from milk, so we need to be producing a large amount of grass to feed [cows] through the summer and the winter,” she said. Milk from her family’s farm is used to make cheddar cheese.\n\nLangton noted that a lot of other farms also rely on fertilizer to grow wheat, maize and barley to feed their cows. If they can’t produce enough, they could be forced to sell some of the herd, either to slaughter or to other dairy farmers.\n\nFertilizer prices were increasing before the invasion of Ukraine because of a spike in natural gas prices last year. Nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea and ammonium nitrate are produced from natural gas.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine made matters worse. Russia and its ally Belarus are major exporters of fertilizer, but few buyers want to touch their supply now. An estimated 18% of the UK’s urea comes from Russia and 7% of its ammonium nitrate, according to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.\n\n“Russia is such a big exporter of fertilizer, and they have so many sanctions,” said ICIS analyst Deepika Thapliyal. “That’s going to keep supply very tight.”\n\nThe price of fuel and animal feed\n\nEnergy prices aren’t just a factor in fertilizer production. Fuel is also essential to running a farm, where tractors and other machines can run for between 16 and 20 hours a day.\n\nLangton estimates that the cost of the diesel her family uses has more than doubled compared to last year.\n\nHeifers feed in a barn at a farm in Ashford, Kent. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe price of animal feed for cows, which supplements their diets, has surged, too. The UK’s National Farmers’ Union estimates that feed prices have climbed by 70% over the past two years.\n\nBefore the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for more than a quarter of global wheat exports. But the disruption caused by Russia’s blockades at Ukrainian ports sent prices to an all-time high in March. They’ve since come down slightly but remain extremely elevated, rising again in recent days as India banned exports.\n\nWheat, along with maize and soy, serves as a benchmark for feed prices, Allen of Kite Consulting said.\n\nCraig, the farmer, said that Ukraine produces the “vast majority” of feed for organic dairy cows in the United Kingdom. Now, that product is practically inaccessible.\n\nHow it shakes out\n\nIt’s not a given that grocery stores will hike milk and other dairy prices in line with dramatic forecasts. Stores are wary of raising the price of essential items too much, lest they scare away customers.\n\n“Some retailers will be prepared to take a much lower margin, if not potentially small losses, [to] make [sure] people come through the door,” said Tom Holder, a spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium. “No one wants to go to the supermarket that has the high-priced milk.”\n\nBut farmers like Langton and Craig worry that the dynamics hurting their businesses aren’t going away. Many have to contend with rising labor and transportation costs, too.\n\n“There’s literally nobody to employ. You advertise jobs and there’s very little response,” said Craig. Two of his farms produce milk for cheese. Milk from the third farm is dried and used in a cappuccino mix made by Nestlé (NSRGY).\n\nKite Consulting estimates that total costs of production for dairy farmers will rise by 29% from 2021 to early 2023. Government subsidies, meanwhile, are dropping, making it even harder to break even.\n\n“If we don’t see the milk price increasing alongside hyperinflation, we could see a lot of dairy farms exiting the industry across the UK,” Langton said, referring to the price at which her family can sell its milk to processors.\n\nRising food costs will hit poorer households the hardest. About a quarter of Britons have already skipped meals in response to the cost-of-living crisis, according to a survey published by Ipsos this week. That number rises to one in three for people with lower incomes.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the United Nations World Food Programme, has warned that rising food prices will cause social unrest in some parts of the world.\n\nAs prices are pushed higher to help farmers stay in business, demand is expected to begin to fall off, allowing the market to rebalance itself. But when that moment will arrive remains an anxiety-inducing unknown.\n\n“I don’t think it’s too expensive yet,” Kite Consulting’s Allen said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2019/02/28/average-grocery-store-bill-cost-is-driven-up-most-by-these-items/39094659/", "title": "Grocery store bill: Average cost is driven up most by these 20 items", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Charles Stockdale\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAmericans today pay an average of 19.1 percent more on grocery items than they did 10 years ago. Over the same time, the inflation rate was just 16.3 percent.\n\nSeveral key factors generally affect food prices in the long run. High oil prices increase the cost of shipping; droughts and floods cause shortages of certain crops; and a growing appetite for more expensive food from an increasingly affluent world population drives up overall demand – and prices – of food.\n\nAmericans may also feel the effects of recently imposed tariffs on goods traded between China and the United States in the checkout aisle. This is particularly true of certain items like canned goods.\n\nIn the short run, the supply and demand of food is subject to factors such as weather, disease outbreak, and changing consumer preferences. In recent years, the California drought, the 2015 avian flu outbreak, and an increasing appetite for higher priced items such as organic foods in the United States and meat and dairy products in developing countries have caused some goods to appreciate in price far faster than most food items.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nDangerous trend:Pedestrian deaths hit 28-year high, suggesting SUV boom raises safety risks\n\nSweat equity:How a little home DIY can help you avoid a down payment\n\nTo determine the groceries driving up food bills the most, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed changes in the consumer price index from 2008 to 2018 for over 300 goods using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTo avoid repetition, we excluded certain items from the list when a similar product had a larger increase. For example, two items classified on the CPI – uncooked ground beef and beef and veal – each had substantial price increases. Only beef and veal, which had the larger 10-year increase, remained on the list. The prices of 20 grocery items increased by at least 21 percent over the last 10 years.\n\nProperty crime:This is where shoplifting, burglary and car theft are highest in every state\n\nIncome inequality:States where the middle class is disappearing\n\n20. Rice, pasta, cornmeal\n\n10-year price increase: 21.5 percent\n\nMany crops are feeling the effects of climate change. Major heat waves across the world have made growing and harvesting crops like rice and wheat more difficult. The cost of rice has increased and, for the first time in six years, there was a global wheat deficit in 2018, according to Bloomberg. The price increase has likely had a profound effect on American grocery bills, as Americans consume 19.4 pounds of pasta per capita annually.\n\n19. Other fats and oils including peanut butter\n\n10-year price increase: 21.7 percent\n\nOne driving force behind the rising price of other fats and oils like peanut butter was likely the rising price of peanuts. As more farmers are switch from peanuts to more profitable crops like cotton, the amount of land used to grow peanuts in the United States shrunk by an estimated 18 percent in 2018. In recent years, peanut butter consumption has spiked in the United States. Partially as a result, In the last 10 years, the price of other fats and oils by climbed 21.7 percent.\n\n18. Bread\n\n10-year price increase: 22.4 percent\n\nA staple of the human diet dating back millenia, bread has become much more expensive over the past decade. Extreme weather across the world has affected wheat harvests. Major wheat producers like Australia and Russia have faced droughts and heatwaves. This has cut into supply, forcing bakeries to raise bread prices. In the last 10 years, the price of bread in the U.S. climbed 22.4 percent.\n\n17. Canned fruits\n\n10-year price increase: 22.5 percent\n\nThe yield of crops such as fruit, and therefore their price, is highly susceptible to unpredictable weather events like heatwaves and droughts. But canned fruits may be feeling the squeeze from newly imposed U.S. tariffs. New taxes on steel imported from China are raising packaging costs for makers of canned goods. In the last 10 years, the price of canned fruit climbed by 22.5 percent.\n\n16. Pet food\n\n10-year price increase: 23.0 percent\n\nOne of the likely contributors to the 23 percent spike in pet food prices is the greater demand for premium products. As millennials are delaying marriage and having children later in life compared to previous generations, they are getting pets instead and lavishing them with high-quality pet foods, according to a Business Insider report. Even though the total sales of pet food by volume declined in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016, the amount spent went up considerably.\n\n15. Bacon, breakfast sausage, and related products\n\n10-year price increase: 24.5 percent\n\nBacon and sausage is about 25 percent more expensive now than 10 years ago. As is the case for many food items on this list, the climb in the prices of breakfast meat is partially attributable to growing demand. Americans are projected to consume in 2019 an average of 52.3 pounds of pork, the most commonly used meat for bacon and sausage, up 7 percent from 48.9 pounds per capita in 2008, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nPork prices in the United States will likely be affected by the recently imposed Chinese tariffs. American pork is now subject to a 25 percent tax in China, which will likely reduce demand in that country and lower profits for American hog farmers. Where pork prices go from here remains to be seen.\n\n14. Frozen fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 24.7 percent\n\nThe U.S. aquaculture industry largely consists of catfish, trout, salmon, tilapia, hybrid striped bass, sturgeon, walleye, and yellow perch. Shrimp, salmon, and canned tuna make up more than half of seafood consumed in the United States. The vast majority of seafood Americans eat is imported. The increase in the price of seafood likely stems from rising demand for fish worldwide, particularly in China.\n\n13. Sauces and gravies\n\n10-year price increase: 25.6 percent\n\nSauces and gravies cover a wide range of condiments that can go on anything from pasta to a sandwich. While prices for specific sauces and gravies may vary, on average, their prices have gone up by 25.6 percent over the last 10 years, faster than the 19.1 percent increase in prices across all grocery items.\n\nThe price increase is likely due in part to growing demand. Sauces and gravies are used to add flavor to food, and as such they are an unnecessary expense Americans today can better afford. Americans have more disposable income now than they did 10 years ago -- the beginning of the Great Recession.\n\n12. Fats and oils\n\n10-year price increase: 25.6 percent\n\nThere was a 25.6 percent increase in the price of fats and oils in the last decade. As is the case for many foods on this list, the climbing price of fats and oils was driven largely by growing demand -- particularly for olive oil. The United States consumed 339,512 tons of olive oil in 2015, up 250 percent from 1990. Over the same period, global olive oil consumption climbed by a lower 73 percent. Olive oil contains certain healthy dietary fats and antioxidants, it may lower the risk of heart disease. Because of its purported health benefits, consumption is projected to continue to climb in the future as Americans become increasingly health conscious.\n\n11. Canned vegetables\n\n10-year price increase: 25.7 percent\n\nCanned vegetables have a longer shelf life than fresh produce as well as lower shipping and handling costs. While these factors generally contribute to lower prices, the rising demand of canned vegetables seems to have contributed to rising prices. According to the USDA, canned vegetable consumption tends to rise with age. The considerable growth of the U.S. elderly population over the last decade likely led to an increased demand for canned vegetables overall, contributing to the product's sharp rise in the price.\n\n10. Fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins\n\n10-year price increase: 27.2 percent\n\nTraditional biscuits, rolls, and muffins share many of the same ingredients, but butter may be the one factor contributing most to their 27.2 percent price increase in the last 10 years. Over the last decade, butter prices have climbed 43.6 percent in the United States, driven by growing demand. Due in part to Americans' awareness of benefits associated with natural fats found in butter that are more healthful than those in margarine, butter sales climbed by an annual average of 7 percent in North America from 2012 to 2017.\n\n9. Cakes, cupcakes, and cookies\n\n10-year price increase: 27.6 percent\n\nThe price of cakes, cupcakes, and cookies rose slightly faster than the price of flour, which is a main ingredient in many of these baked goods. The rising cost of butter has likely contributed to the increase in baked goods prices. The price of butter rose by 43.6 percent over the last decade, more than nearly any other food item.\n\n8. Frankfurters\n\n10-year price increase: 27.6 percent\n\nPerhaps no food is as iconically American as the hot dog. According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, Americans consume an average of 70 hot dogs a year -- despite the common belief that eating more than two per year is unhealthy.\n\nFrankfurters are one of several meats to rank on this list. In the last decade, the average price of a frankfurter climbed by 27.6 percent. Frankfurters are traditionally made from pork and beef, the former of which has surged in demand -- and price -- in recent years. What effect that will have on demand for frankfurters remains to be seen.\n\n7. Salt and other seasonings and spices\n\n10-year price increase: 31.5 percent\n\nOne factor contributing to the increase in the price of salt overall may be the rapid growth of the gourmet salt market, which includes products such as Himalayan salt, sel gris, and fleur de sel. While a rise in price can reduce demand for a consumer good, sodium consumption among Americans has remained largely unchanged over the past 10 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n6. Oranges, including tangerines\n\n10-year price increase: 37.6 percent\n\nOrange growers in Florida, the largest orange-producing state, have had to deal with several issues in recent years. The state was hit with an incurable disease in 2017 that depleted citrus trees. Hurricane Irma was also a destructive force that year. While Florida's crops are recovering, the state is also facing now international competition from countries such as Brazil.\n\n5. Prescription drugs\n\n10-year price increase: 39.1 percent\n\nDespite heavy competition, pharmaceutical companies have raised the prices of prescription drugs in recent years. The prices of four of the 10 most popular prescription drugs in the United States -- including arthritis drugs Humira and Enbrel -- have more than doubled since 2011. Despite the rising costs, demand for drugs has continued to grow in recent years. The share of Americans using at least one prescription drug a month has risen from approximately 38 percent two decades ago to nearly half of all Americans, according to the CDC.\n\n4. Beef and veal\n\n10-year price increase: 42.4 percent\n\nThere is currently no shortage of meat in the United States. Meat's high cost is primarily driven by strong demand, especially for beef and veal. Exports of these meats hit a record of 2.9 billion lbs in 2017 with Japan the top buyer. This demand has contributed to the increase of 42.4 percent in the price of beef and veal in the United States.\n\n3. Shelf stable fish and seafood\n\n10-year price increase: 42.5 percent\n\nOne factor affecting the cost of fresh fish is the rising cost of fishmeal, which has increased production costs of farmed seafood. Additionally, as the average consumer has become wealthier, demand for more expensive, high-end fish such as tuna and salmon increased, which drove the price of fresh seafood higher.\n\n2. Margarine\n\n10-year price increase: 50.2 percent\n\nWhile butter and margarine are considered substitute goods – increased in demand (in this case butter) for one often coincides with a decline in demand for the other – the prices of both rose in the past decade. The increase in margarine prices, however, outpaced the increase in butter prices over the past decade, spiking by 50.2 percent – faster than nearly any other grocery product.\n\n1. Tobacco and smoking products\n\n10-year price increase: 88.7 percent\n\nThe price of tobacco and smoking products in the United States nearly doubled in the past decade, rising by 88.7 percent from 2008 to 2018 – the largest increase of any grocery item in the country. The rise was largely because of a federal tax hike implemented on April 1, 2009, that increased the tax on cigarettes by 61.7 cents per pack. As a result, cigarette sales declined by 8.3 percent in 2009 alone – the largest decline in nearly 80 years.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Last year's farm income hit the highest level since 2016, with corn and soybean prices closing in on record highs set in 2012 and 2013.\n\nFarming is a significant economic driver in Iowa, which leads the nation in corn, hog and egg production, and is second to Illinois in soybean production. Agriculture ripples through the state's economy, with ties to equipment manufacturing, insurance, seed and renewable fuel production — another category Iowa leads.\n\nThe state ranks second only to California when it comes to the size of its farm economy.\n\nLance Lillibridge, president of the Iowa Corn Growers board, said he believes U.S. farm income will be lower this year than the agriculture department predicts in its forecast, released Friday, with production costs exploding.\n\n\"I think incomes will be significantly in the red,\" said Lillibridge, who grows corn and soybeans and raises cattle near Cedar Rapids.\n\nMORE: Deere strike adds to Iowa farmers' worries about getting parts, equipment now and next year\n\nThe agriculture department expects the costs to raise crops and livestock will grow 5.1% to $411.6 billion over the 2021 figure, with the price of fertilizer climbing 12% and for livestock feed, 6.1%. This year's expected hike in expenses comes on top of a 9.4% increase last year, the forecast said.\n\nLillibridge, however, said the increases he's seeing are far greater. He said his fertilizer costs are up 300% and the costs of herbicides, pesticides and other crop protection products are up 100% to 150%.\n\n\"It makes you want to throw up,\" he said, adding that he expects his fertilizer costs will be $190,000 more than last year's by the time the season ends.\n\nThe forecast said soybean growers should expect to get 8.9% more when they sell their crops this year, and corn growers should receive 4.8% more, with both increases primarily due to larger quantities sold.\n\nCash receipts for soybean are expected to hit a record high, Litkowski said.\n\nCash receipts for dairy producers are expected to be 22.1% higher, the forecast said, and 8.5% higher for calf and cattle operators, both based on strong price growth.\n\nHog producers can expect to get 10.3% less for their animals this year, coming off strong prices in 2021, Litkowski said.\n\nWhile the prediction of improved prices for cattle is encouraging, Lillibridge said, receipts probably won't keep pace with increased costs.\n\nMore: Iowa farmers get big break with good harvest, high prices. But will their luck hold?\n\nFarmers have a lot on their minds going into the next growing seasons, he said. In addition to higher production costs, Iowa farmers are concerned about whether they'll have equipment and parts next season, given supply-chain issues, and remain concerned about the possibility of a drought.\n\nMore:Competition is fierce for Iowa's used farm equipment, attracting bidders from across the world\n\nIowa and large parts of the Midwest struggled with drought conditions last year. Many farmers said they received rain just in time to preserve crop yields.\n\nThe latest U.S. Drought Monitor report, released Thursday, showed almost 55% of Iowa experiencing abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions in the week ending Feb. 1. That was up from about 52% the previous week and about 48% a year ago.\n\n\"It probably wouldn't take much for us to drop back into a drought,\" Lillibridge said.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

But it was so much ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUS prices for just about everything – from cars and gasoline to food and clothing – are rising at the fastest pace in decades.\n\nOverall, consumer prices rose in 2021 at the fastest pace in 39 years, meaning this is the worst inflation experienced by anyone not on the cusp of retirement or older.\n\nBut, as those older Americans can tell you, as unwelcome as it is for consumers, today’s price increases are nowhere near as bad as they were in the 1970s and early 1980s. And most importantly for policymakers trying to deal with today’s price hikes, what fed the double-digit prices increases in those days are not a factor today – nor are they likely to be ever again.\n\n“We learned our lessons from that experience,” said Louis Johnston, economics professor at College of Saint Benedict in Minnesota.\n\nPresidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, both tried and failed to bring prices under control. Ford’s efforts included a “Whip Inflation Now” or WIN campaign, complete with shiny red buttons, that did little to help with prices. Inflation hit 12.2% in late 1974, soon after he took office, nearly twice the annual pace of increase through November of last year.\n\nThe inflation rate hit a record high of 14.6% in March and April of 1980. It helped to lead to Carter’s defeat in that fall’s election. It also led to some significant changes in the US economy.\n\nToday the annual inflation rate stands at an unadjusted 7.1%, the highest 12-month change since June of 1982.\n\nHere’s some of the key factors different from today’s US economy and the economy of the 1980s:\n\nWages tied to prices\n\nOne of the major differences between inflation then and now is that a much greater percentage of the US population were unionized workers, and many of those workers had what was known as Cost of Living Adjustments, or COLAs, built into their contracts. That raised their wages automatically as prices increased. So higher prices led to higher wages, which put more money in the hands of consumers and raised costs for businesses. It created what was known as the “wage-price spiral” that fed higher prices.\n\nEven non-union employers would raise wages to keep pace with inflation or risk losing the workers to unionized employers – or risk giving an argument to union organizing campaigns at their companies.\n\nA close-up of a WIN (Whip Inflation Now) button, President Ford's symbol of the fight against inflation in 1974. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nToday, only about 12% of workers are represented by unions, about half the rate of 1983, the earliest year for which the government recorded that data. Today’s unionized workers are primarily government workers, such as teachers, police and firefighters. Only 7% of workers in the private sector are union members. And most of those don’t have COLA clauses in their contracts. During the extended period of low inflation over the past couple decades, unions were willing to give up COLAs in return for other improvements in wage and benefit.\n\nAbout the only widespread COLA now in effect is for Social Security recipients, and employers don’t feel a need set wages to compete with those benefits.\n\nWages are rising because of a record number of unfilled job openings and a shortage of workers. But even those wage increases are less than the rate of inflation, so it’s not likely to feed into higher prices.\n\nA global check on prices\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, higher costs could be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices more readily than now because competition from overseas imports wasn’t as great then as it is today.\n\nCompetition from overseas certainly existed then, but in many sectors of the economy, businesses only had to worry about domestic competitors. That’s not the case any longer.\n\nA surge in global trade has kept inflation in check in recent decades. Part of today’s inflation is being attributed to problems with the global supply chain, which has led to a worldwide increase shipping costs. So that has limited the supply of low-cost competition, which in turn has allowed even leading domestic companies to raise their prices as well.\n\nOil shocks hurt worse back then\n\nOne common factor between the record inflation of the 1970s and 1980s and today is rapidly surging energy prices.\n\nThe 1973 Arab-Israeli War prompted Arab members of OPEC to impose an embargo on oil shipments to the United States that lasted into 1974. And the Iran-Iraq war of 1979 choked off supply as well.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter giving a speech on the economy and inflation in March 1980. Chuck Fishman/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nThe limited supply sent prices soaring. Drivers were hit with a 69% increase in gas prices in early 1980 compared to a year earlier, which was even worse than the 58% annual increase through November of this year.\n\nThis time, large percentage increases in oil and gas prices are partly due to comparisons to the very low prices of 2020, when stay-at-home orders and widespread temporary job losses created a glut of oil, and temporarily resulted in negative oil prices.\n\nThose lower prices prompted producers to cut oil output, and some refineries to close. When demand returned this year, the tighter supply and strong demand combined to drive up prices.\n\nAlthough oil and gas prices could very possibly stay or climb even higher in the months ahead, the good news is that the US economy is much less dependent on oil today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.\n\nMoving from an economy built around energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing to one driven by service industries has reduced the relative dependence on oil.\n\n“One of the most overlooked changes is the reduced energy intensity of the American economy,” said Johnston.\n\nComparing total energy consumption to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity, shows the US economy uses about a third of the energy per inflation-adjusted dollar of economic activity that it did in 1970, and about 44% of what it used when inflation peaked in 1980.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s oil shocks significantly reduced oil as a source of fuel for electricity generation to the point where it is well less than 1% today. And more importantly, much more fuel-efficient cars also limited oil consumption despite many more miles being driven. That means Americans are spending far less on oil compared to other items.\n\nDeregulation\n\nAnother significant change in the US economy is that the government is much less involved in setting prices than it was then.\n\nDeregulation of industries such as telecommunications, airlines and trucking all started partly as a response to the high prices of the 1970s and 1980s, said Johnston. Government-controlled prices generally limited competition and kept prices and services offered to consumers artificially high.\n\nAlthough the actual changes in the law didn’t take effect until after the inflation dragon had been slayed, the deregulation has worked to keep prices for many of those goods and services lower than they likely would have been otherwise.\n\nInflation finally did come under control, thanks largely to the Federal Reserve under chairman Paul Volcker jacking up the federal funds rate to a record 18.9%, sparking recessions in both 1980 and another in 1981-82. By the time the second recession ended, the inflation rate was down to 4.5% and it wouldn’t hit 5% again until 1990.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/business/grocery-prices/index.html", "title": "Food prices are skyrocketing, and it's not just because of inflation ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing overall, but food prices are still sky-high.\n\nOver the last 12 months, grocery prices soared 13.1% — the largest annual increase since the year ending in March 1979, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.\n\nThe prices of nearly every grocery item have ballooned over the past year.\n\nThe cost of eggs has soared 38%, and prices for other goods have also jumped: Flour is up 22.7%, chicken 17.6%, milk 15.6%, ground beef 9.7% and bacon 9.2%. Fruits and vegetables got 9.3% more expensive.\n\nGrocery items are still going up. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the rise in food costs: A deadly avian flu has meant fewer eggs in the United States, a severe drought in Brazil slashed coffee crops and the war in Ukraine led to a spike in wheat prices in the spring.\n\nWhile commodity prices are falling, it will take time before those lower costs pass through to consumers. Plus, plenty of other costs for producers — such as fuel, labor and packaging — have also been high.\n\nAnd as supply has been disrupted, demand has grown.\n\nDemand for groceries grows\n\nUnlike discretionary items, consumers can’t simply stop buying food when prices rise. They may, however, opt for less expensive options. Producers, grocers and restaurant operators have noted that consumers are indeed trading down — swapping out higher-priced items for more affordable ones.\n\nEarlier this week, Tyson (TSN) said demand for steak is falling while interest in chicken is rising. Wendy’s (WEN) traffic has been hit because some customers are deciding to pack lunches or eat breakfast at home, CEO Todd Penegor said during a post-earnings analyst call Wednesday.\n\nPenegor added that about 82% of meals were eaten at home pre-pandemic, but that figure jumped three percentage points since then and has stayed there.\n\n“The consumer has been a little more strapped, so there’s a few more meals prepared at home,” Penegor said. “Inflation has been high, so net disposable income has been a little bit pinched.”\n\nRestaurants have also been raising prices, but at a slower clip: In the 12-month period through July, menu prices rose 7.6%, less than overall inflation.\n\nPlus, food prices are largely unaffected by current government efforts to curtail spiraling costs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged as much during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, saying that raising interest rates to fight inflation wouldn’t lower food prices.\n\nThe Fed believes that “food and energy are influenced by global commodity prices in a way that tells them, ‘Hey, these items aren’t really directly under your control,’” noted Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America Global Research.\n\nEssentially, the thinking is this: Because the US can’t control international factors such as the war in Ukraine and higher shipping costs, it can’t fully control domestic food prices.\n\nWhat’s more, the US government doesn’t have a stockpile of food as it does of oil, noted Rob Fox, director of the knowledge exchange division at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses.\n\n“There’s no ability for the government to release extra stalks of wheat and corn and cheese and so on,” Fox said.\n\nWhat got more expensive in June\n\nThe result has been steadily higher prices in the grocery aisle, with some items seeing larger month over month spikes than others.\n\nIn July, adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices popped 4.3% compared to June. Coffee and peanut butter each got 3.5% more expensive. Flour rose 3.2% and bread prices went up 2.8%. Cheese jumped 2%, while chicken got 1.4% pricier.\n\nThere was some relief, however. Citrus fell 3.2%, and whole milk dropped 1.4%. Uncooked beef roasts fell 1.3%, and uncooked steaks fell 1.1%. Ham got 1% cheaper.\n\nThe biggest decline was in hot dog prices, which dropped 6.1%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/20/24-7-wallst-fastest-rising-food-prices/7882819/", "title": "The 10 fastest-rising food prices at the grocery", "text": "Alexander E.M. Hess and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nFood prices at the grocery store are up, following an increase in production costs and wholesale prices. In March, retail food prices rose 0.4% from the preceding month, matching February's increase. These marked the largest monthly gains in food prices since September 2011, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nFood prices are often volatile and are affected by a number of factors. While certain factors reflect human decision — such as the changing tastes of consumers and farmers' planting choices — others are forces over which farmers have very little control. Issues such as weather conditions and diseases can cause severe supply shortages that cause the price of products to rise.\n\nIn recent years, drought in the western U.S. has driven up the prices of meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables. Parts of California, the Southwest, and the Great Plains have suffered from three consecutive years of drought, according to Brad Rippey, meteorologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). More than two-thirds of California is currently covered by extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.\n\nOf course, drought directly impacts crops. \"Agriculture uses about 80% of California's water,\" Rippey told 24/7 Wall St., and, because of cutbacks in water delivery, \"a lot of fields may have to lay fallow.\"\n\nDrought has also driven up meat prices because it caused feed prices to spike in recent years, Rippey added. The higher feed prices increase the cost of raising cattle for slaughter and, in the end, the meat prices for consumers. Bacon prices have gained more than nearly any other food tracked by the BLS since the start of the decade, rising 35% to $4.13 per pound.\n\nThe price of the only food product that has risen more than beef is bacon, which soared 53% since January 2010. This is due in large part to the spread of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv) in hogs. Although the disease has no effect on humans or food, it can be fatal for young pigs and is therefore expected to cut into hog production considerably. Ham and pork chop prices have also increased since 2010, up 32% and 24%, respectively.\n\nDiseases are hardly limited to livestock. Citrus fruit, too, has suffered from a disease. Production of both oranges and grapefruits has dropped as citrus greening disease has damaged Florida crops — which account for the majority of grapefruits and oranges produced in the U.S. Trade publications, national media, and even the USDA have portrayed the disease as a threat to the survival of the citrus industry.\n\nDemand is another key factor that drives food prices. According to Steve Freed, vice president of research at ADM Investor Services, the agricultural world pays attention to a number of trends that can drive prices. These include the state of major economies, such as the U.S. and China, as well as consumer tastes. \"We'll be watching any change in U.S. and world diet,\" he added.\n\nTo identify the food prices that have risen the most, 24/7 Wall St. examined average retail price data published by the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the period January 2010 through March 2014. Similar kinds of products, including certain beef and pork products, were grouped together to avoid duplication. We also reviewed data on commodity futures from CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange Group for a range of products. A number of reports produced by the USDA were also considered.\n\nThese are the 10 fastest rising food prices.\n\n1. Bacon\n\n> 4-yr. change: +53%\n\n> 1-yr. change: +13%\n\n> Current price: $5.55 per lb.\n\nSliced bacon cost an average of $5.55 per pound as of March, up from $3.63 per pound in January 2010. In the last year alone, the price of bacon increased 13%. One factor that may contribute to this recent increase may be the spread of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv) in hogs. While PEDv poses no risk to humans or food safety, the disease is expected to cut into hog supplies. Sam Hines, executive vice president of the Michigan Pork Producers Association, told CBS Radio that \"U.S. production is going to decline this year about seven percent and that will probably translate into 10 to 20 percent higher prices for pork.\" Currently, lean hog futures — settling in May — are up over 20% on the year, and consumer prices of products such as pork and ham may increase further. Ham prices are up 32% since January 2010, and 6% since last March. Similarly, pork chop prices are up 24% and 8% during those periods.\n\n2. Ground Beef\n\n> 4-yr. change: +35%\n\n> 1-yr. change: +8%\n\n> Current price: $4.13 per lb.\n\nDrought in the Western U.S. and declining numbers of cattle being sent to slaughter are both major causes of higher beef prices, according to the USDA. Futures for live cattle — which are cattle ready for slaughter — reached an all-time high earlier this year. These higher futures prices appear to be showing up at the register. The price of a pound of uncooked ground beef has risen 35% since 2010. And for some types of beef, the price increases have been even greater. For example, lean and extra lean ground beef now costs $5.27 per pound, a 55% increase from January 2010 as well as an all-time record.\n\n3. Oranges\n\n> 4-yr. change: +35%\n\n> 1-yr. change: +23%\n\n> Current price: $1.21 per lb.\n\nFlorida citrus growers have had to contend with citrus greening, a disease spread by a small invasive insect called the Asian citrus psyllid. The disease has hit citrus growers hard, cutting significantly into crop production. The lower supply, in turn, has led to increased prices, both in the futures market for frozen orange juice concentrate, as well as for consumers. Since the start of 2010, the price for navel oranges has risen 35%. However, much of this increase was just in the last year, as consumer prices for oranges rose 23% between March 2013 and March 2014 — more than any other food product. And prices may continue to rise. According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. national orange production is forecast to decline 18% from the previous year to a total of 166 million\n\n4. Coffee\n\n> 4-yr. change: +31%\n\n> 1-yr. change: -17%\n\n> Current price: $5.00 per lb.\n\nBrazil, the world's largest supplier of arabica beans, has suffered from a severe drought this year. But because many producers have amassed stockpiles, and top coffee retailers such as Starbucks have locked-in short-term prices, consumers have yet to feel the pinch from the poor crop year. Coffee futures, however, have risen considerably — up nearly 70% year-to-date. For consumers, coffee prices have actually declined in the last year — although coffee prices in general have risen 31% since the start of 2010. Higher prices may eventually reach consumers. A USDA study found that retailers were less likely to considerably raise prices in response to short-term increases in commodity prices. However, where higher costs lasted for longer periods, costs would be shifted to customers.\n\n5. Peanut Butter\n\n> 4-yr. change: +30%\n\n> 1-yr. change: -2%\n\n> Current price: $2.71 per lb.\n\nLike several food products with rising prices, the poor growing conditions for peanuts in recent years are behind the increase in peanut butter prices. While prices are down slightly from a year ago, peanut butter still costs an estimated 30% more than it did in 2010. Much of the price increase followed the abysmal 2011 growing season in the Southern U.S. — nearly half of the nation's peanuts are produced in Georgia. Output in 2012 was considerably better, but in 2013 production fell again, down 38% from 2012. A significant uptick in Chinese demand in 2012 may have also increased prices, although exports to China have since leveled off.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But it’s not the only cause of the spike.\n\nNumerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.67 a gallon Wednesday according to AAA’s survey.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired in Eastern Europe or economic sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\n“I think we reach $5 somewhere between this weekend and Juneteenth/Father’s Day weekend,” he said.\n\nIt was back in March that prices first broke the record of $4.11 a gallon, which had stood since 2008. That now seems like the good old days: The national average has been rising steadily for the past month, setting 27 records in the last 28 days.\n\nMore than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than $5 a gallon for regular, and just more than half are charging $4.75.\n\nThere are 10 states, plus Washington, DC, where the average price is already at $5 or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Several more are within a penny of $5, so those states’ prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark.\n\nThat’s because there’s a number of reasons beside the disruption of Russian oil exports driving prices higher according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. And making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult. Wednesday’s record is already higher than Kloza a few weeks ago expected prices would reach. As school let out and summer travel picks up, so will gasoline demand and price, he said.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said.\n\nHere’s what’s behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. In 2021 Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led Western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nBut in March the United States announced a formal ban on all Russian energy imports. And Monday the EU announced a ban on imports of Russian oil by ship, which represented about two-thirds of the oil European nations imported from Russia. Russia’s oil is slowly and steadily being removed from global markets.\n\nChina lockdowns ending\n\nOne factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of Covid cases, and strict lockdown rules in much of the country. That was a major drag on demand for oil.\n\nBut as the Covid surge has started to retreat, the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as Shanghai. And more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nLess oil and gas from other sources\n\nOil prices plunged when pandemic-related stay-at-home orders around the world crushed demand in the spring of 2020, and crude briefly traded at negative prices. In response, OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed to slash production as a way to support prices. And even when demand returned sooner than expected, they kept production targets low.\n\nUS oil companies don’t adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand. Many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n“The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,” Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said earlier this spring. “People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.”\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n“They can’t find people, and can’t find equipment,” McNally added. “It’s not like they’re available at a premium price. They’re just not available.”\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, said earlier this spring. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks, instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nOne of the starkest examples: ExxonMobil (XOM) last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan, far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production lagging behind pre-pandemic levels, US refining capacity is falling. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. Some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products.\n\n“Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,” said Kloza.\n\nAnd with prices in Europe even higher than in the United States, both Canadian and US oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent. That has also limited the US supply.\n\nStrong demand for gas\n\nBut supply is only part of the equation for prices. Demand is the other key, and while it’s very strong right now, it’s still not back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US economy had record job growth in 2021, and while those gains have slowed, they remain historically strong. Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office.\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend is likely to spark the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 10% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\n“Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,” said Kloza.\n\nCommuting may remain down slightly. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, and the total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels. But there will be periods, most likely this summer, with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic, Kloza predicts.\n\n“Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,” Kloza said. “Now it’s a question of how much we break the record by.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/11/10/consumer-prices-surge-october-highest-inflation-rate-since-1990/6368816001/", "title": "Consumer prices surge in October, highest inflation rate since 1990", "text": "Christopher Rugaber\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON – Prices for U.S. consumers jumped 6.2% in October compared with a year earlier, as surging costs for food, gas and housing left Americans grappling with the highest inflation rate since 1990.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in the consumer price index exceeded the 5.4% rise in September, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. From September to October, prices jumped 0.9%, the highest month-over-month increase since June.\n\nInflation is eroding the strong gains in wages and salaries that have flowed to America's workers in recent months, creating political headaches for the Biden administration and congressional Democrats and intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve as it considers how fast to withdraw its efforts to boost the economy.\n\nDuring remarks at the Port of Baltimore Wednesday, President Joe Biden noted that the United States economy faces challenges with inflation.\n\n\"Many people remain unsettled by the economy and we all know why. They see higher prices,” he said. “Everything from a gallon of gas to loaf of bread cost more. It's worse even though wages are going up. We still face challenges.”\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n“We’re tracking these issues and trying to figure out how to tackle them head on,” he added.\n\nDriving the price spikes are persistent supply shortages resulting from robust consumer demand and COVID-19-related factory shutdowns coming out of the pandemic recession. Ports across the world have become bottlenecked. America's employers, facing labor shortages, have also been handing out sizable pay increases, and many of them have raised prices to offset their higher labor costs, thereby contributing to inflation.\n\nMore:Fed says it will reduce purchases of bonds as inflation rises, economy recovers following COVID-19 recession\n\nThe result has been accelerating prices for a broad range of consumer goods, from food, heating oil and patio furniture to paints, chemicals and window blinds. After initially affecting mainly goods in pandemic-disrupted industries, surging inflation has broadened into the many services that Americans spend money on, notably for restaurant meals, rental apartments and medical services, which jumped 0.5% in October.\n\nJob gains and pay raises have been much healthier during the pandemic recovery than they were after the Great Recession roughly a decade ago. But in contrast to the years that followed that downturn, when inflation was low, rising prices are diminishing Americans' confidence in the economy, surveys have found.\n\nThe president attributed some supply chain issues to more Americans staying home and buying more goods as a result of increased wages and stimulus checks that went out earlier this year.\n\n“On the one hand, we're facing new disruptions to our supplies. At the same time, we're also experiencing higher demand for goods because wages are up, as well as people have money in the bank because of the strength of our economic recovery,” he said.\n\nBiden noted that he spoke with major retailer CEOs, including Walmart and Target, to assure that store shelves will continue to stay stocked this holiday season amid supply chain shortages. The White House also announced this week new investments to create pop-up container yards in Georgia and North Carolina to ease congestion in the supply chain.\n\nMore:Gas prices rise to a seven-year high. Here's a look at states where drivers pay the most\n\nIn October, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices rose 0.6% from September. Core prices are now up 4.6% compared with a year ago.\n\nEnergy costs soared 4.8% just from September to October, with gasoline, natural gas and heating oil surging for the same reason that many other commodities have grown more expensive: Demand has risen sharply as Americans are driving and flying more, but supplies haven't kept up.\n\nIn the past year, energy costs have jumped a whopping 30%, with gasoline soaring nearly 50%. Natural gas prices are also soaring, and so is heating oil. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that these increases will bite hard this winter, with Americans expected to spend 30% more on natural gas and 43% more on heating oil.\n\nMore:Food prices and inflation keep going up but here are 3 tips to save on your groceries\n\nEconomists still expect inflation to slow once supply bottlenecks are cleared and Americans shift more of their consumption back to pre-pandemic norms. As COVID-19 fades, consumers should spend more on travel, entertainment and other services and less on goods such as cars, furniture, and appliances, which would reduce pressure on supply chains.\n\nBut no one knows how long that might take. Higher inflation has persisted much longer than most economists had expected. And inflation is spreading well beyond items like appliances and new and used vehicles that are directly affected by the pandemic.\n\n\"The inflation overshoot will likely get worse before it gets better,\" Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note Sunday.\n\nFor months, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had described inflation as \"transitory,\" a short-term phenomenon linked to labor and supply shortages resulting from the speed with which the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession. But last week, Powell acknowledged that higher prices could last well into next summer.\n\nPowell announced that the central bank will start reducing the monthly bond purchases it began last year as an emergency measure to boost the economy. Investors now expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate twice next year from its record-low level near zero – much earlier than they had predicted a few months ago.\n\nMany large companies are passing on the cost of higher pay to their customers, and in some cases, consumers are paying up rather than cutting back.\n\nFast food prices soared 7.1% in October from a year earlier, the government said Wednesday. That was the largest such increase on record, reflecting higher costs for beef and other foods as well as rapidly rising labor costs.\n\nTo attract workers, for example, McDonald's boosted hourly pay 10% to 15% over the past year. To help cover those higher labor costs as well as more expensive food and paper, the company said last month that it raised prices 6% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier. Yet even so, company sales leapt 14% as virus restrictions eased.\n\nOther companies have been more cautious. One of them, Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, said last week that its costs are rising as factories in Asia have shut down amid COVID outbreaks, ports are jammed, and labor costs have surged. But the company isn't necessarily passing along all those higher costs.\n\n\"We are in a mass-oriented business where the average customer does not have an unlimited discretionary budget,\" said Michael Fleisher, Wayfair's chief financial officer. \"Inflation is rampant across the economy, and there are competing demands for their time and wallet share.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/08/18/future-gas-prices-predictions/70622402007/", "title": "Why are gas prices going up? Costs soar to 10-month high", "text": "Gas prices have been climbing again, hitting the highest level since October 2022, according to motor vehicle club AAA.\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline last week reached $3.87, 31 cents higher than last month and a nickel more than the week prior, AAA said. The price is still below the $3.93 people paid one year ago, but Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at gas price tracker GasBuddy, sees the potential for prices to rise above that before summer ends.\n\nThat increase could derail budgets for Labor Day travel and fan inflation again, analysts said. Gas prices are getting perilously close to $4 per gallon, seen as a tipping point for Americans, AAA said. Among 1,051 Americans AAA surveyed in February 2022, 59% said they would make changes to their driving habits or lifestyle if the cost of gas rose that high.\n\nWhile July inflation data “looked pretty good with energy prices well below their year-ago level, August data isn’t going to look nearly as friendly,” De Haan said. Annual inflation in July rose 3.2%, down sharply from July 2022’s 8.5%.\n\nWhy are gas prices climbing?\n\nGas prices reflect the steady rise in oil costs since June and a slowdown at refineries as record heat bakes portions of the nation. Add to those issues a new concern: hurricane jitters.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n◾ Oil prices account for about half the price of a gallon of gasoline, followed by refining costs. Refiners convert oil into usable products like gasoline.\n\nOil prices have been rising partly from production cuts by Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies as well as soaring demand. August saw record world oil demand, boosted by strong summer air travel, increased oil use in power generation and surging Chinese petrochemical activity, the International Energy Agency said in a report.\n\n◾ Extreme heat across the nation prevents refineries from running at full capacity. AAA estimates extreme heat shut down 500,000 barrels per day of refining capacity this summer. “Petroleum engineers can tell you that when ambient temperatures get to the 100-degree neighborhood, it is difficult to run at maximum levels,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service.\n\nAccuweather predicts that the heat dome that's been scorching the southern United States for weeks will expand across more of the central part of the country this weekend into next week.\n\n◾ Hurricane season has begun with Hurricane Hilary, which was downgraded to a tropical storm when it hit southern California, and parts of Nevada and Arizona last weekend. Even if Hilary doesn't inflict pain on the oil and gas industry, the risks of a storm that could cause problems have risen. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters this month increased the likelihood of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season to 60%, up from 30% in May. “The U.S. is especially vulnerable to supply issues for a strong storm that strikes between Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas, coastline,” Kloza said, referring to an area with a concentration of refineries.\n\nHow high can gas prices go?\n\nWeather is the wildcard, analysts said.\n\n“These looming weather concerns are a roadblock to falling pump prices,” said Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson.\n\nIf a hurricane hits Gulf refineries, supply could be curtailed and gas prices would rise not just in the U.S. but across the world, Kloza said.\n\nCaught in the middle:President Biden faces criticism from oil and gas, environmentalist after New Mexico visit\n\nWhere is gas the most expensive?\n\nAccording to Monday's data from AAA:\n\n◾ California, $5.255\n\n◾ Washington, $5.048\n\n◾ Hawaii, $4.776\n\n◾ Oregon, $4.716\n\n◾ Alaska, $4.514\n\n◾ Nevada, $4.459\n\n◾ Arizona, $4.234\n\n◾ Utah, $4.228\n\n◾ Illinois, $4.144\n\n◾ Idaho, $4.116\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

But many leaders from the 193 UN member countries were in the United Kingdom for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, forcing their missions to the UN to scramble to reschedule speeches and rendezvous.\n\nPerhaps most prominent among the changes, US President Joe Biden will speak on Wednesday morning instead of taking America’s traditional second speaking slot after Brazil on Tuesday. Biden has also built in time for chats with country leaders in London, which may limit some discussions in Manhattan.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the only world leader to speak by video, occupied as he is by the war in his country. The Assembly on Friday overrode Russian objections to permit Zelensky to speak virtually.\n\nNot ‘business as usual’\n\nThe invasion of UN member country Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, could cast a shadow over the entire General Assembly:\n\n“The General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril,” UN Secretary-Antonio Guterres said at a press conference last week. “Geostrategic divides are the widest they have been since at least the Cold War. They are paralyzing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face.”\n\nDon’t expect this year’s General Assembly to be “business as usual,” US Assistant Secretary for International Organization Affairs Michele Sison said on Friday. “Russia’s unprovoked, ongoing assault on Ukraine raises serious questions about its commitment to diplomacy, the UN Charter, and the territorial integrity of nations.”\n\nMany UN diplomats say that Russia has put the UN’s credibility and image at stake this year by invading another UN country, with the UN unable to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop.\n\nThe great majority of UN membership strongly opposes Russia’s war in Ukraine. Expect Western countries to use their official speeches to bash Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will speak on Saturday, but no Western country has said if they have bilateral planned with the Russian visitor.\n\nOthers fear Russia’s war has displaced other issues of global importance, like the climate crisis. “This would have been a climate UNGA but Russia has taken care of that with its invasion of Ukraine,” one diplomat told CNN.\n\n“It does occupy a lot of space,” said Stefan Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary General, during a press briefing on Monday. “Because we know that the war in Ukraine is having a global impact, on food, on grain, on the energy crisis. It’s having a knock-on impact on the fight against climate change, where – because of the energy crisis – we see member states reverting back to polluting sources of energy.”\n\n“It is however not stopping the Secretary General from raising all these other issues,” he added.\n\nBut the US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, emphasized the need to take a broad view, telling reporters on Friday that “next week will not be dominated by Ukraine, but we will not ignore Ukraine. We know that as this horrible war rages across Ukraine, we cannot ignore the rest of the world,” she added.\n\n“[There are] a lot of leaders who feel [Russia’s war in Ukraine] is a distraction from problems in their own region,” International Crisis Group’s UN director Richard Gowan also said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, there will be a ministerial Security Council session on Ukraine, with Lavrov the highest ranking member of the Russian government to attend.\n\nStill, some may wish for fewer verbal attacks on Moscow, seven months into the conflict. One diplomat told CNN that poorer countries on the sidelines feel a calmer tone could assist in finding an end to the conflict – and need Russian oil or food supplies.\n\nFood security is another major topic for the global forum, with the world economy hard-hit by the pandemic, inflation and struggling supply chains. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to chair a meeting on food during the high-level week.\n\n“What we’re hoping to do is really bring the world together to address all of the issues related to food insecurity. So it’s bringing both the south as well as countries – developing countries and donor countries together in the room to address these issues,” said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nStill, it’s another year where citizens of the world may wonder what the UN really does, given the nightmare in Ukraine and low levels of donations from member countries towards other crises.\n\n“The UN as an organization is not in position to deliver anymore because everything is upside down,” another UN diplomat said.\n\nBut at least it can put on a big show again, with many world leaders making their first appearance in several years. There will be hundreds of speeches, handshakes, parties and panels. An estimated 140 heads of state and government will attend. And chasing them will be hundreds of media members from around the world.\n\nAs another diplomat put it, everyone is a “moving target” at UNGA.", "authors": ["Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/09/20/biden-un-general-assembly-2023-key-meetings/70863350007/", "title": "Takeaways from Biden's UN speech, meeting with Bibi Netanyahu at ...", "text": "NEW YORK – The war in Ukraine. U.S. tensions with Russia, China and Iran.\n\nAnd Bibi finally got his meeting with President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden and other world leaders had an agenda chock-full of issues involving social and diplomatic concerns when they gathered this week for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nBiden, who spent three days in New York for the gathering, sat down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday on the sidelines of the summit. It was a meeting Netanyahu had wanted, but not exactly what he had in mind.\n\nNetanyahu had been pushing to meet with Biden at the White House since his return to power last December. But Biden, upset over Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul Israel’s judicial system and concerned about his commitment to democratic checks and balances, was reluctant to give him a high-profile Oval Office meeting.\n\nSo they met at a Manhattan hotel instead.\n\n“We're going to discuss some of the hard issues,” Biden said.\n\nBiden, who has known Netanyahu for years, stressed that even with their differences, the U.S. commitment to Israel is “ironclad.”\n\n“Without Israel,” he said, “there's not a Jew in the world who is secure. Israel is essential.”\n\nNetanyahu said one thing will never change: Israel’s commitment to democracy.\n\n“We will continue to uphold the values that both our proud democracies cherish,” he said.\n\nThe meeting ended but not before Biden invited Netanyahu to visit Washington by year's end.\n\nHere are three other takeaways from the U.N. summit:\n\nWorlds apart:NYC migrant crisis is one of several shadows looming over Biden at United Nations\n\nBiden, Zelenskyy warn of 'aggression'\n\nBiden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy both addressed the members of the general assembly on Tuesday and warned of the consequences of pulling back on support from Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nIn his annual address to the body, Biden cast solidarity with Ukraine as a necessary step to deter other would-be aggressors. Russia believes the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence, he said. If U.N. member nations abandon their core principles and appease an antagonist, no one will be safe, Biden said.\n\n“If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?” Biden asked. “I respectfully suggest the answer is no.”\n\nBiden’s stark message seemed to be directed at Washington as much as those world leaders in the audience. As American support for the war in Ukraine has softened, some congressional Republicans are resisting his request for $24 billion in military and humanitarian aid for the war-torn country.\n\nA few hours after Biden spoke, Zelenskyy echoed his remarks, warning in his address to the body that Russia’s aggression won’t stop with Ukraine and that its invasion of his country is pushing the world toward a “final war.”\n\n\"Many seats in the General Assembly hall may become empty – empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nWho wasn’t there for either speech? Russian President Vladimir Putin, who skipped the U.N. gathering.\n\nZelenskyy:If Ukraine loses, U.S. must choose between the collapse of NATO or going to war\n\nIran leader slams US, other 'old powers'\n\nEbrahim Raisi, Iran’s hardline president, attacked the United States for pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2018 and accused America of imposing sanctions as a political tool.\n\nHis remarks came the same day five Americans who had been imprisoned in Iran returned home as part of a prisoner exchange the Biden administration negotiated with Tehran.\n\nRaisi told journalists the exchange could help build trust between the nations. But he didn’t hold back in his address to the General Assembly.\n\nRaisi said through an interpreter that U.S. sanctions on Iran haven’t worked and “old powers will keep their current downward trajectory.”\n\n“They represent the past,” he said, “and we are the future.”\n\nAs Raisi spoke to the General Assembly, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, walked around the room holding up a banner with a photo of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman who died last year while in police custody after allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. Erdan later walked out of the assembly hall with other Israeli diplomats.\n\nAmericans are freed from Iran:So, why is the prisoner swap controversial for Biden?\n\nBiden on Bette Midler, Trump and 2024\n\nIn between his meetings with world leaders, Biden also carved out some time for fundraisers for his reelection campaign.\n\nNew York’s Times Square, a hectic zoo of humanity even without a presidential invasion, grew even more chaotic and congested as Biden’s motorcade zipped across West 46th Street to Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Monday night for one of the campaign events.\n\n“Broadway for Biden,” announced a red, white and blue marquee outside the theater. Inside, Biden took the stage as an orchestra played “All That Jazz.”\n\nIn his brief remarks, Biden spoke to the crowd of actors, theatrical producers and others about Bette Midler, Donald Trump and what’s at stake in next year’s election.\n\nYears ago, Biden said, when his sons Beau and Hunter were younger, he took them to a Midler show on Broadway. The bawdy performer spotted the boys in the crowd and asked who on earth would take kids to a show like this, Biden recalled.\n\nOn Trump, Biden said the former president, who is also the GOP front-runner for 2024, and MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy democracy. “I’m running because democracy is at stake because democracy is on the ballot once again,” he said.\n\nIf voters send him back to the White House, Biden said, \"we will have saved democracy.\"\n\nMichael Collins and Maureen Groppe cover the White House.

The combined effects of the prolonged conflict and economic uncertainty have created a dark mood among world leaders gathering in New York this week for the annual high-level UN meetings.\n\nBiden had already planned to make the Ukraine war a centerpiece of his yearly UN address, with aides previewing a harsh message for Moscow. But Putin’s announcement that he was ordering a “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens in the Ukraine war and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons dramatically increased the stakes for Biden’s address.\n\nBiden accused Putin of making “irresponsible nuclear threats” in his speech, and declared “a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought.”\n\n“Let us speak plainly: A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase the sovereign state from the map,” he said.\n\nHours earlier, in his 20-minute speech, Putin warned he would use “all the means at our disposal” if he deemed the “territorial integrity” of Russia to be jeopardized. The mobilization means citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, Putin said, adding that the necessary decree had already been signed and took effect on Wednesday.\n\nIn response, Biden said Putin was waging a war meant to demolish the Ukrainian nation.\n\n“We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression, period,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video: Putin's threats and military escalation explained 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden warned that the basis of the United Nations’ charter is “under attack” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, which he cast as a “shameless” violation of the body’s founding document.\n\n“As we meet today, the UN charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage,” Biden said, noting that the 1945 charter was negotiated by citizens “united in their commitment to work for peace.”\n\nPutin’s escalation came after stunning Russian setbacks in the war, which has dragged on for more than six months. Biden, who has led efforts to isolate Russia and supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, had already been planning to underscore those efforts in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nPutin’s national address, which occurred after Biden had arrived in New York late Tuesday, caused White House aides to update some of the language in Biden’s speech, according to an official. But a total rewrite wasn’t necessary because White House officials had anticipated some of what Putin would say.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also planned to address the UN later on Wednesday.\n\nAfter making his debut UN address last year under the cloud of a messy Afghanistan withdrawal and stalled domestic ambitions, Biden’s aides believed he entered his sophomore outing with a stronger hand.\n\n“We believe that the President heads to New York with the wind at his back,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, citing a mostly-united western alliance and recent wins on the domestic front, including a historic investment in fighting climate change.\n\nQuestions about US leadership\n\nEven as Biden proclaimed renewed US leadership Wednesday, deeper questions persist over his ability to maintain that position in the years ahead, as fears of a global recession looms and threats to American democracy fester.\n\nBiden has spent ample time underscoring those threats in recent weeks, primarily for a domestic audience but with foreign capitals also listening intently. He has recounted in recent speeches sitting around a table at last year’s Group of 7 summit in Cornwall, England, telling fellow leaders that “America is back.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Biden has told audiences, asked him: “For how long?”\n\nThat question still hangs over Biden’s efforts on the world stage, even a year-and-a-half into his term, as his predecessor continues to wield influence over the Republican Party and prepares to mount another run for the White House. Biden himself said in an interview that aired Sunday that while he intends to run for reelection, a final decision “remains to be seen.”\n\nOne of the issues currently at the forefront of global affairs – the pained negotiations to restart the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew – only underscores the effects of pendulum swings in American leadership.\n\nIn his speech, Biden reiterated his stance that the US will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon as negotiations to revive a nuclear deal have failed to make significant progress in recent months.\n\n“While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Biden said.\n\nFor Biden, the yearly UN speech was another stab at explaining to the world how he has steered the United States back into a position of leadership after the “America First” years of Donald Trump.\n\nHe called for expanding the United Nations Security Council, saying countries should refrain from using their veto powers except in rare circumstances.\n\n“The United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent” Security Council members, Biden said in his speech.\n\nHe said constant vetoes from countries on the Council were harming its effectiveness, and said only using vetoes in “rare, extraordinary situations” would ensure the council “remains credible and effective.” Russia has consistently vetoed resolutions at the Security Council that have blocked action on Ukraine and other areas.\n\nIn his speech, Biden also announced $2.9 billion in US assistance to help address global food insecurity. The $2.9 billion investment, the White House said in a fact sheet, is aimed at shoring up food supply amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflation and other supply chain issues, and builds on $6.9 billion already committed by the US this year.\n\nIt includes $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance through USAID, the US Agency for International Development.\n\nLater Wednesday morning, Biden will host a pledging session for the Global Fund to Fight HIV, AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the evening, Biden and the first lady will host a leaders’ reception at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSpeech drafted over weeks\n\nBiden and his aides have been drafting the address for several weeks, a period that coincided with Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive taking back some Russian-held territory after months of occupation. The initiative had been coordinated with American officials, including through enhanced information and intelligence sharing, and sustained by weaponry provided by the US and its allies.\n\nUS officials have cautioned Ukraine’s current gains don’t necessarily signal a wider change in the outlook of the war, which remains likely to be a prolonged conflict. A day ahead of Biden’s speech, two Russian-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine announced plans for referendums on officially joining Russia, votes the US has previously warned would be “shams.”\n\nOne of Biden’s objectives in his speech Wednesday was stressing the importance of maintaining unity among western allies in supporting Ukraine in the uncertain months ahead.\n\nThat effort is made more difficult by a looming energy crisis as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas to Europe as winter sets in. Higher costs spurred in part by withering western sanctions on Moscow have led to an economic calamity that is causing political turmoil for many leaders in Biden’s coalition, including himself.\n\nMeeting new British leader\n\nThe President meets with one of those leaders, British Prime Minister Liz Truss, later Wednesday. It will be their first formal in-person talks since Truss entered office earlier this month following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\n\nShe inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. While few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation – Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\n\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\n\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hardline approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\n\nBiden’s message for China\n\nPutin is not attending this year’s general assembly, though his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov was in New York for the event. Chinese President Xi Jinping also did not attend the UN in person this year.\n\nThe two autocratic leaders, who met in-person last week, have deepened ties between their countries as relations with the west deteriorate. Biden has warned Xi against supporting Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, a theme he’s expected to reiterate in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nBiden said in his speech the US was not seeking “conflict” with China or other nations.\n\n“We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partners,” Biden said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/21/u-n-speech-biden-call-unity-around-international-rules/10429869002/", "title": "In UN speech, Biden to call for unity around international rules", "text": "Launching into his impassioned 30-minute speech at the United Nations Wednesday, President Joe Biden accused Russia of having \"shamelessly violated\" a core tenet of the U.N. charter prohibiting the taking of another country by force.\n\nEverything the U.N. stands for is at risk if Russia can take another nation by force, Biden told the annual gathering of world leaders as Russia takes steps to rebuild its military.\n\n\"Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe,\" Biden said, \"that should make your blood run cold.\"\n\nSpeaking days after he angered China by once again promising to come to Taiwan's aid if China attacks, Biden said the United States continues \"to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/23/india-un-security-council/2857697/", "title": "India upset over UN Security Council paralysis", "text": "AP\n\nIndia%2C%20Brazil%2C%20Germany%20and%20Japan%20all%20want%20to%20join%20UNSC\n\nU.N.%20has%20discussed%20change%20since%201979\n\nIndia%27s%20U.N.%20ambassador%3A%20UNSC%20is%20%27completely%20paralyzed%27\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) — India says frustration is building among U.N. member states over paralysis in the Security Council and its inability to respond to international crises.\n\nThe South Asian nation is promoting its years-long effort for expansion of the U.N.'s most powerful body during the annual gathering of world leaders this week.\n\nIndia, Brazil, Germany and Japan all want to become permanent council members and are pushing for a reform proposal that world leaders can consider in 2015, when the U.N. holds its 70th anniversary summit.

But every proposal has been rejected, primarily because of rivalries between countries and regions more concerned about their own self-interests than the improved functioning of the U.N.\n\n\"I think the frustration is being felt now by the international community because they find that the Security Council is completely paralyzed. It does not respond in time to various crises,\" Mukerji said. He said the council is unrepresentative and so can't carry out its mandate in maintaining international peace and security.\n\nPermanent members Russia and China have been at odds with Britain, France and the United States over whether a resolution on destroying Syria's chemical weapons should be backed up by a threat of force.\n\nThe diplomatic wrangling over how to respond to the two-year civil war in Syria is the latest international crisis to put a spotlight on the division among the five veto-wielding members of the council.

She witnessed contamination in the water that spilled over from the Lerma River.\n\n\"This paralyzed me for a long time,\" Bastida said.\n\nIt turned her into an environmental activist, like her parents.\n\nBastida, now a 21-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, marched through the streets of New York City along with some 75,000 other activists on Sunday to demand the end of fossil fuels. She was also a part of the Climate Ambition Summit youth delegation convened by United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres.\n\nNotably absent from the summit was President Joe Biden, who skipped the event even though he was in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nTo Bastida, Biden’s absence was one more indication that he’s out of step with many young Americans when it comes to climate change. Many Gen Zers, those born after 1996, said they feel they are being asked to grab the reins and demand that leaders take action, when it should be the other way around.\n\nLeaders need to recognize all the tools they have at their disposal right now to make real change instead of waiting for younger Americans to grow up and do it themselves, said Jilly Edgar, 24, who works at the Climate Museum in New York City and joined the march on Sunday.\n\nShe added: \"By then, it will be too late.\"\n\n'Climate-proofing' the world\n\nAt the U.N. General Assembly, Biden and other world leaders spoke of the urgency of addressing climate change.\n\nBiden said in his remarks to the high-profile gathering on Tuesday that the world is already seeing the effects of climate change. He pointed to record-breaking heatwaves in the United States and China, wildfires in North America and southern Europe, a fifth year of drought in the Horn of Africa, and flooding in Libya that has killed thousands of people.\n\nClimate impact:Extreme heat, coupled with chronic health issues, is killing elderly New Yorkers\n\nClimate change is un-burying graves:It's an expensive, 'traumatic,' confounding problem.\n\n“Together, these snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and begin to climate-proof the world,” he said.\n\nGuterres, in his opening remarks, bluntly warned that actions to deal with climate change have fallen “abysmally short.” He called on countries to stop the expansion of coal, oil and gas production, saying “the fossil fuel age has failed.\"\n\n“We cannot afford the same old broken record of scapegoating and waiting for others to move first,” Guterres said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro called climate change “the mother of all crises” and complained that mankind has “dedicated itself to war,” which he said has distracted attention and resources to deal with climate change.\n\nBut climate activists who protested in the streets ahead of the U.N. meeting said they want action, not words. They want a phase-out of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nA U.N. climate report released this month said the world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 to fight climate change. The world needs to reduce emissions by 43% in the next seven years to reach the goal set under the agreement, the report said.\n\nBastida said leaders have not kept their promises on climate change. She points to Biden's campaign promise that he would ban fossil fuel extraction on federal land.\n\n\"When he was campaigning, he said he'd ban fossil fuel extraction of federal land. Next thing he does is sell oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, \" said Bastida, an ambassador of the nonprofit Climate Clock.\n\n“It's just incredibly frustrating because the politicians that are deciding our futures, they're not going to be around in 30 years when I'm in my 50s,\" she said. \"When I have kids, they're going to see a different world than the politicians are shaping now with their decisions.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden delivered on one major demand of climate activists with the announcement of the nation’s first-ever American Climate Corps, which will seek to train and provide career paths to young people who want to take on the climate crisis.\n\nThe initiative, which seeks to enlist 20,000 people in year one, will train Americans on the conservation and restoration of lands and waters, deploying clean energy, bolstering community resilience to climate change, and advancing environmental justice, among other areas.\n\nThe concept for the civilian climate corps is based on former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps, which put millions of Americans to work on public works projects during the Great Depression.\n\n“We’re not just opening up pathways to decarbonization,” said Ali Zaidi, White House climate adviser. “We're opening up pathways to good-paying careers, lifetimes of being involved in the work of making our communities more sustainable, more fair, more resilient, in the face of a changing climate.\"\n\nBiden has taken a number of other steps to fight climate change.\n\nA year after taking office, he set a new national goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and pledged to make the U.S. power sector 100% carbon-pollution-free by 2035. Biden also has signed an executive order setting a target for zero-emissions vehicles to account for half of all automobiles sold in the U.S. by 2030 – a thorny issue with striking laborers such as United Auto Workers.\n\nBiden's Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last year, put in place a comprehensive set of clean energy initiatives. These include tax credits to help Americans buy electric vehicles, energy-efficient heat pumps and rooftop solar panels.\n\nEnvironmental groups hailed the law as the most significant piece of climate legislation in U.S. history.\n\nStill, the fact that the Civilian Climate Corps, which was pushed by many environmental groups, wasn't in the original Inflation Reduction Act was a huge disappointment, said Edgar of the Climate Museum.\n\nBut she was glad to hear of the new announcement since, she said, creating the climate corps is crucial for a just transition.\n\n“We need to make sure that we actually have a robust workforce changing the way that we are physically structured and also economically structured to align with averting the climate crisis,\" she said.\n\nBiden angered environmentalists, including young climate activists, in March when his administration cleared the way for a scaled-down version of the Willow project, the largest new oil and gas developments on federal land in Alaska in 20 years. Conservation groups have sued to block the project.\n\nBiden made some amends with his critics two weeks ago when he canceled the seven remaining oil and gas leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. His administration proposed stronger protections for more than 20,000 square miles of land in the reserve in the western Arctic.\n\nFederal data show the Biden administration approved 6,430 permits for oil and gas drilling on public lands in its first two years, outpacing the Trump administration’s 6,172 drilling-permit approvals in its first two years, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThat shows the wide gulf between what people of her generation are demanding and what Biden is doing, Edgar said.\n\n“It's really important to keep putting pressure on him because he entered office with a big commitment that he has since broken,” she said.\n\nBiden's 'wishy-washy' on climate action\n\nFor 24-year-old Ayisha Siddiqa, a research scholar at New York University Law School studying the intersection of human rights and climate change, Biden’s policies are “wishy-washy.”\n\nWhile Biden has showcased himself as a climate president and has had progressive policies related to climate, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the actions of the administration don’t often represent what they are saying, Siddiqa said.\n\n“Biden's been playing a game of ‘let’s see how many people it makes angry and how much potential damage I can cause. And then last minute when I realize it's the wrong decision, I'm going to take it back’,” said Siddiqa, who serves as a youth advisor to the Secretary General of the United Nations.\n\nYoung voters list climate as a top issue across party lines. Nearly 60% of those ages 18 to 29 believe climate change should be a priority, even at the risk of slowing economic growth, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nSaskia Randall, 26, who participated in the march with the Climate Museum team where she works, said it was important to show up for these protests. They demonstrate the force and the desire that young people have to end fossil fuels.\n\nAttending these marches gives an extra boost of energy, Randall said.\n\n\"And serves as a reminder,\" she went on, \"there are so many people who care about the climate crisis and really want serious action taken and serious climate policy.”\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/28/5-things-you-need-know-tuesday/72956912/", "title": "5 things you need to know Monday", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n1. U.S. foreign-born population nears high\n\nThe foreign-born population living in the USA has increased so rapidly that it could break a 125-year-old record within the next decade, according to a Pew Research Center report out Monday. The percentage of people living in the USA who were born outside the country reached 13.7% in 2015 and is projected to hit a record 14.9% in 2025, the report said. The country's previous high of 14.8% was set in 1890, when waves of Irish, Italian, Polish and other immigrants were coming to the USA.\n\n2. Trevor Noah era begins on 'The Daily Show'\n\nSouth African comedian Trevor Noah, 31, begins his tenure as the third host of The Daily Show Monday, seven weeks after Jon Stewart ended his 16-year run at the helm of the Comedy Central news satire. Noah has promised some changes to the way the show approaches stories. Unlike Stewart, who was easily riled up by hyperactive cable-news outlets, Noah will start out focusing more on people making news than those delivering it. Kevin Hart is his first guest, followed later in the week by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and singer Ryan Adams, a sign of the show's continued interest in a blend of politics and entertainment.\n\n3. Trial of guide in Cecil the lion killing due\n\nA professional hunter accused of failing to stop a Minnesota dentist from killing Cecil the lion is due to be tried in a Zimbabwean court Monday. Theo Bronkhorst faces charges of failing to prevent an unlawful hunt at the court in Hwange town. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison. Bronkhorst acted as a guide for dentist Walter Palmer in the July 1 killing of Cecil, a much-loved lion in the Hwange National Park. Palmer has said he believed the hunt was legal. At his last court appearance in August, Bronkhorst branded the case against him \"frivolous and wrong,\" and told reporters he believed he had the right permits, and did not break the law.\n\n4. NASA to announce 'major science finding' about Mars\n\nNASA says it will reveal a \"major science finding\" from its exploration of Mars on Monday in a press conference at its Washington, D.C. headquarters. Many people are likely already thinking of little green men since NASA's tantalizing news release, \"NASA to Announce Mars Mystery Solved.\" The revelation will more likely deal with water on Mars, since three of the scientists who will be participating in the news conference are among the authors of a paper that asserts images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show the existence of flowing water on the surface of Mars. Such as discovery could have an important impact on NASA's quest to send a manned mission to Mars by the 2030s.\n\n5. World leaders gather for United Nations summit\n\nAbout 160 world leaders will gather in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly's annual ministerial meeting, to address unrest in the Middle East and other global issues related to peace and international security. While some leaders are arriving specifically for the session that opens Monday, others have already spoken at a separate three-day U.N. summit that ended Sunday and was focused on new U.N. development goals. Addressing a U.N. meeting on sustainable development Sunday, President Obama called on all countries to \"step up\" efforts to eradicate poverty, and by scheduling a meeting on Tuesday with Cuban counterpart Raul Castro.\n\nAnd, the essentials:\n\nWeather: There will be rain for much of the country Monday, but it's should be a very pleasant day out West.\n\nStocks: U.S. stock futures were lower Monday, as investors looked ahead to Chinese and U.S. economic data.\n\nTV tonight: Wondering what to watch tonight?

It said that according to national security prosecution investigations, some of those arrested have allegedly sent videos calling for protests over social messaging apps. Some were also charged with abuse of social media, spreading false news and joining terrorist organizations – a repressive charge commonly used by the security apparatus against activists.\n\nIndian climate activist Ajit Rajagopal was detained in Cairo last Sunday after setting off on a protest walk from the Egyptian capital to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the COP27 conference will be held from November 6 to 18. Rajagopal was released after a brief detention in Cairo along with his friend, lawyer Makarios Lahzy, a Facebook post by Lahzy said. Reuters, which spoke to Rajagopal following his release Monday, cited the Indian activist as saying he was still trying to get accredited for COP27 but did not plan to resume his march.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nEgypt went through two mass uprisings in 2011 and 2013 which eventually paved the way for then-military chief Sisi to take power. Thousands of activists have since been jailed, spaces for public expression have been quashed and press freedom diminished.\n\nWhile protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt, a looming economic crisis and a brutal security regime have spurred renewed calls for demonstrations by dissidents seeking to exploit a rare window of opportunity presented by the climate summit.\n\nOne jailed activist, British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abdelfattah, escalated his hunger strike in an Egyptian prison this week, amid warnings by relatives over his deteriorating health. “Alaa has been on hunger strike for 200 days, he’s been surviving on only 100 calories of liquid a day,” said Sanaa Seif, Abdelfattah’s sister, who is staging a sit-in outside the UK Foreign Office in London.\n\nA place for dialogue\n\nCOP, the annual UN-sponsored climate summit that brings together the signatories of the Paris Agreement on combating climate change, is traditionally a place where representatives of civil society have an opportunity to mingle with experts and policy makers and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see a young activist approaching a national delegation walking down the corridor to their next meeting or an indigenous leader chatting to a minister on the sidelines of a debate.\n\nAnd while security is always strict – this is, after all, a gathering attended by dozens of heads of states and governments – peaceful protests have always been part of COP. Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of last year’s host city of Glasgow, Scotland, during the summit.\n\nYet Egypt has tightened the rules on who can access the talks.\n\nAs in the past, this year’s COP conference will take place across two different sites. The official part of the summit is run by the UN and is only accessible to accredited people, including the official delegations, representatives of NGOs and other civil society groups, experts, journalists and other observers.\n\nThen there is a separate public venue where climate exhibitions and events take place throughout the two weeks of the summit. But while this public part of the summit was in the past open to anyone, people wishing to attend this year will need to register ahead of time.\n\nThe chance to protest will also be restricted.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government has pledged to allow demonstrations, it has said protests will have to take place in a special “protest zone,” a dedicated space away from the main conference site, and will have to be announced in advance. Guidelines published on the official COP website say that any other marches would need to be specially approved.\n\nAnyone wanting to organize a protest will need to be registered for the public part of the conference – a requirement that may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\nRights groups sound alarm\n\nThe UN has urged Egypt to ensure the public has a say at the conference.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said it was “essential that everyone – including civil society representatives – is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh” and that decisions about climate change need to be “transparent, inclusive and accountable.”\n\nSeparately, a group of five independent human rights experts, all of them UN special rapporteurs, published a statement last month expressing alarm over restrictions ahead of the summit. They said the Egyptian government had placed strict limits on who can participate in the talks and how, and said that “a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists.”\n\n“This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt,” the group said in a statement.\n\nA group of Egyptian civil rights groups has launched a petition calling for the Egyptian authorities to end the prosecutions of civil society activists and organizations and end restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n\n“The Egyptian authorities have for years employed draconian laws, including laws on counter terrorism, cyber crimes, and civil society, to stifle all forms of peaceful dissent and shut down civic space,” the groups said in the petition.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth and scores of other groups have also spoken up, demanding the release of detained activists.\n\nIn the lead-up to the climate conference, the Egyptian government presented an initiative pardoning prisoners jailed for their political activity. Authorities also pointed to a new prison, Badr-3, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Cairo, where other prisoners were moved to purportedly better conditions.\n\nBut rights groups said the government’s initiatives amounted to little change.\n\n“Ahead of COP27, Egypt’s PR machine is operating on all cylinders to conceal the awful reality in the country’s jails, where prisoners held for political reasons are languishing in horrific conditions violating the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.\n\n“Prisoners are facing the same human rights violations that have repeatedly blighted older institutions, exposing the lack of a political will from the Egyptian authorities to bring an end to the human rights crisis in the country.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/04/cop-27-climate-summit-trumps-ongoing-legal-issues-5-things-podcast/8264866001/", "title": "COP27 climate summit, Trump's ongoing legal issues: 5 Things ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: What to know about the COP27 climate summit\n\nUSA TODAY national correspondent Elizabeth Weise has a preview.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 4th of November, 2022. Today, what can we expect at the Climate Summit that kicks off this weekend? Plus how healthcare concerns are swaying midterm voters, and what a survey can tell us about sheriffs around the country.\n\n♦\n\nClimate leaders, activists, protestors, and more will gather in an Egyptian resort town beginning Sunday for the annual United Nations Climate Meeting, known as COP27. But will it be a place where real climate action takes place? Or is it the latest example of greenwashing that actually makes little progress?\n\nI talked with USA TODAY national correspondent Elizabeth Weise to find out. So Elizabeth, what is COP27?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nThis all goes back to 1992 where a bunch of countries, like 154, got together and said, \"Huh, something's going on with the climate. We probably need to start doing something about it.\" And then because it's the UN and it's a very bureaucratic system, ended up creating a yearly conference. And it is the Conference of the Parties, that's where COP comes from, because it's Conference of the Parties who signed the original agreement. So it was COP 1, 2, 3, 4. We're up to 27 now.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what can we expect to happen at this year's summit?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nCOPs tend to have a specific goal, usually, that was set the year or two before. So for this one, one of the big topics, it's called Loss and Damage financing. Basically, it means there are a lot of poor and developing countries in this world who are being really slammed by increasing weather disasters driven by climate change. And they're not the ones who burned all the fossil fuels that created climate change. Like that's on the US, it's on Europe, to a certain extent China, India. And so there's been a lot of discussion about how wealthier nations, and nations that got rich burning a lot of coal to create their wealth, need to compensate or create some kind of an aid fund to help the people living in countries who are on the forefront, and who are really bearing the worst of it right now.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what do critics say about this gathering?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nI mean, one, it's being held in Egypt. Egypt is not known for having a robust ability to allow people to protest things its government does. One of the main sponsors of this year's COP is Coca-Cola, which is also one of the biggest, if not the biggest, producer of plastic in the world. So there are those who say COP, by allowing companies like Coca-Cola to be sponsors, allows them to greenwash, and seem greener than they actually are. And so that'll also be some of the protests you see or some of the complaints.\n\nCritics are saying, and they're totally right, we should have done more and we should have done it faster. We need to totally remake our entire industrial system to move away from carbon producing energy sources. And all of that is true. And yet, it is also true that the last 26 COPs, and this framework for discussion amongst nations, has led to some pretty remarkable shifts. And so we've seen China and India both shifting to renewable fuels. The US, our greenhouse gas emissions peaked, I believe, it was in 2007. They're still not as low as they should be, but they peaked in 2007.\n\nElectric vehicles now make up more than 5% of all the new cars purchased in the United States. And in China, that number is 24%. Some of the scientists that I have spoken with, and actually I spoke with a business professor from Columbia University, and he said this is one of those things where it is a big ship and it takes a really, really long time for it to turn. And so it's kind of imperceptible. But he said, we started making some of these changes 20 years ago and we're starting to see that bear fruit. And yes, it wasn't fast enough and it wasn't enough, but all hope is not lost by any means.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find more of Elizabeth's coverage on COP27 with a link in today's show description and on USATODAY.com.\n\n♦\n\nHealthcare concerns - including Medicaid coverage gaps, expensive prescription drugs, and high medical bills - are swaying midterm voters in swing states. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY politics reporter Ken Tran, to find out more on how healthcare may affect Tuesday's elections.\n\nKen Tran:\n\nDemocrats are winning the messaging on healthcare. According to a survey from Pew Research Center, they're winning 51% to 27%, but it's very hard to sell healthcare and legislative victories in this election where everyone is concerned about inflation. It's very unclear if that's going to work out for Democrats.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKen, according to the CDC, one in 10 Americans have diabetes and one in five don't know they have it. But we've heard for years how expensive it can be for diabetics to get insulin. In you're reporting, are you talking to people who may be changing their votes because of healthcare costs?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nI spoke with this one teacher who is an Independent voter, but she's voting for Democratic challenger, Mandela Barnes, because she cares about healthcare the most. She's a diabetic voter and she pays a lot for insulin and insulin supplies. She saw Republicans, in both Congress and Wisconsin State Legislature, shoot down insulin caps for private insurers, and that was enough to convince her to vote Democratic this year.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nKen, what about at the state level? What role does healthcare play in those races?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nIn Alabama, one voter told us that the Medicaid gap affected her and her daughter. Her daughter had undiagnosed breast cancer, and they found out too late because they couldn't afford a mammogram, because they had no insurance. And by the time it was diagnosed, the cancer has spread to the rest of her body and she eventually died. Alabama has yet to expand Medicaid, so things like this can still keep happening for voters, and eventually it might move the needle in a way that could flip races.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe judge hearing a massive civil fraud lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, his businesses, and three of his adult children, ordered a monitor yesterday to oversee all Trump Organization financial reporting. New York Attorney General Letitia James's September lawsuit against Trump and his family amounts to $250 million. Her court filing argued that's how much Trump should pay for a 10-year scheme that allegedly inflated his personal net worth by billions of dollars, and then used the higher values to convince banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms. Those actions would've violated New York state laws. Yesterday's ruling from the Manhattan Supreme Court, means that Trump businesses must give the monitor access to all financial statements. The judge ruled that the monitor will help ensure there won't be further fraud pending the lawsuit's final disposition. Trump is expected to appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump lawyers filed a lawsuit against Letitia James in Florida Court earlier this week. They argued her office lacks jurisdiction to seek internal details of a Florida-based trust that holds all of Trump's businesses.\n\n♦\n\nIn an exclusive survey of more than 500 sheriffs, the Marshall Project, a journalism non-profit focused on criminal justice, found that sheriffs are key to our debates on policing, immigration, and much more. PJ Elliott spoke with Maurice Chammah, from the project to find out more.\n\nMaurice Chammah:\n\nSheriffs have this strange place in American politics and law enforcement, because they're directly elected, and because they both create policies and then also enforce those policies. There's a really clear way in which, what they personally believe shapes the way that they approach policy-making. So for example, many sheriffs in our survey are extremely anti-immigrant, a substantial portion of them even clicked, \"agree\" to a statement like, \"Immigrants to this country, take more than they give.\"\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nMaurice, let's jump to abortion. With Roe being overturned and abortion laws moving to a local level, what's the role that sheriffs could be playing in enforcing those new laws?\n\nMaurice Chammah:\n\nGiven that sheriffs are, by and large, very conservative, one can presume that at least a substantial number of them share a kind of Republican party's view on abortion, and will be the frontline law enforcement going after people seeking abortions and going after clinics. And the news stories of that sort have not really emerged yet, but it's only a matter of time I think.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nWell, let's jump to social issues and George Floyd. What did your survey find on incidents where civilians lose their lives at the hands of law enforcement?\n\nMaurice Chammah:\n\nSheriffs, as a whole, see these deaths as isolated incidents. They see racial inequality as a problem of the past that America has, by and large, mostly solved. And those beliefs, influence the unwillingness that sheriffs have about systemic solutions to these problems in policing, that lead to deaths of civilians.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find a link to Maurice's full story in today's show description.\n\n♦\n\nU2's lead singer Bono, is touring to promote his new memoir, Stories of Surrender. But as USA TODAY entertainment host Ralphie Aversa tells us, the tour's shows are different than any U2 performance.\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nThis was nothing like a U2 stadium production and Bono acknowledged as much right from the get-go because it's a little jarring. If you're a huge fan of U2, even if you've only seen them once at one of these big football stadiums, and suddenly you're walking into the Beacon Theater on New York City's Upper West Side with a capacity of under 3000 people. And there is Bono, this incredible rockstar, with three musicians who you probably haven't heard of, none of which are his band mates. A couple of chairs, a table and two projection screens, and you're like, \"Wait, this is the show? This is what it's going to be?\" So it's nothing that you've ever experienced at a U2 show.\n\nThere we were at this iconic theater, and there was Bono on stage really interweaving, both his stories in the memoir and these anthems that we've come to know him and U2 for, in such a meaningful and well-produced way.\n\nHis parents, and particularly his father, were really central figures in this. His father and he, kind of having this tug and pull over Bono's success and his father's expectations, and his father's skepticism at times. But then, ultimately, his father's death in 2001, as he succumbed to cancer. He talked about this idea that you either were going to have fun or do good, but you couldn't do both. Kind of wanted to challenge that as a kid.\n\nSo really, when the band became famous, and we're talking \"Joshua Tree\" era and after, that fame began to be a sort of currency that Bono perceived. And from there, he was able to start the ONE Campaign, which was basically just on the notion that regardless of our differences, there's all one thing that we can agree on and that we could work towards, accomplishing in the world.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find more of Ralphie on Entertain This, USA TODAY'S flagship entertainment video series.

The higher price point on iOS appears to be an effort to account for Apple’s 30% app transaction fee, which Musk recently railed against.\n\nAs part of the new verification system, Twitter will offer gold checks for companies, gray checks for government entities and other organizations, and blue checks for individuals, whether or not they are celebrities. The gold business verification check mark started appearing Monday on the accounts for various companies, such as The New York Times and Taco Bell. Later on Monday, the option to subscribe to Twitter Blue returned to the platform.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that individuals who had been verified under the old system — because they are journalists, celebrities or public figures — would have their checks removed if they did not pay for Twitter’s new subscription service. On Monday, he tweeted that “all legacy blue checks” would be removed “in a few months.”\n\nSome Twitter users have started to see a new explanatory note when they click on the blue checks of accounts that were verified before Musk’s takeover that reads: “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.”\n\nMusk has also said that Twitter, which has cut more than half its staff and lost many others to attrition, would “manually authenticate” all verified accounts before approving their check mark. The company will also temporarily remove check marks pending authentication if verified users change their account names. It’s unclear what that authentication process will involve, beyond verifying that users have a functional phone number. Crawford said in a tweet: “we don’t have ID verification in this update.”\n\nThe company says subscribers to the new Twitter Blue will also eventually have their tweets prioritized at the top of replies, mentions and search; see half the number of ads; and be able to post longer videos.\n\nMusk initially said the relaunch of the new system would take place at the end of November, but it was delayed several times over concerns about the safety of the feature.\n\nThe billionaire Twitter owner has promoted the ability to pay for verification as a way of leveling the playing field. But such an option also threatens to undermine the original purpose of verification — to help users know they can trust information being shared by prominent figures.\n\nIn attempting to use the paid verification option to boost its subscription revenue, Musk also risked further alienating many of the advertisers who still make up the vast majority of its sales. Within hours of launching the paid verification option last month, major brands including Nintendo of America and Eli Lilly had their accounts impersonated.\n\nThe additional gold and gray verification categories appear aimed at addressing some of those concerns, but it’s not clear what a requirement for individuals to pay to be verified would mean for trust in prominent individual users.\n\n“All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes ‘notable’ is otherwise too subjective,” Musk tweeted last month. “Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/business/2-dollar-bill-history/index.html", "title": "What happened to 2 dollar bills? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation has made it hard to buy much with a buck these days.\n\n$1 pizza has disappeared. Dollar stores aren’t dollar stores anymore.\n\nSo wouldn’t it make more sense to start paying with $2 bills instead?\n\n“If you had a $2 bill, perfect,” said Heather McCabe, a writer and $2 bill evangelist who runs the blog Two Buckaroo chronicling her spending with twos and other people’s reactions. “It’s a very useful thing to pay for a small amount.”\n\nYet the $2 note is the unloved child of paper currency.\n\nIt’s considered a curiosity to some and scorned by others in the United States. The myths around the $2 bill — nicknamed “Tom” by fans because it features Thomas Jefferson’s portrait on the front — are endless. Many Americans think $2 bills are rare, are not printed anymore or have gone out of circulation.\n\nWrong.\n\n$2 bills are lighter to carry around in our wallets than ones, cleaner and more efficient. MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty Images\n\nThe Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) will print up to 204 million $2 bills this year, based on an annual order from the Federal Reserve System. There were 1.4 billion $2 bills in circulation in 2020, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBut $2 bills account for just 0.001% of the value of the $2 trillion worth of currency in circulation.\n\nBEP doesn’t have to request new $2 bills each year, like it does for other bills. That’s because $2 bills are used so infrequently and last longer in circulation. The Fed orders them every few years and works down the inventory.\n\n“Many Americans have pretty dubious assumptions about the $2 bill. Nothing happened to the $2 bill. It’s still being made. It’s being circulated,” McCabe said. “Americans misunderstand their own currency to the extent they don’t use it.”\n\nBad luck\n\nThe United States first issued $2 bills beginning in 1862, around the time the federal government first started printing paper money. Alexander Hamilton’s portrait was on the two until a new series was printed in 1869 with Jefferson.\n\nBut the deuce was unpopular and never gained a foothold with the public.\n\nA major reason: The the $2 bill was considered bad luck. Superstitious people would rip off the corners of the bill to “reverse the curse,” making the bills unfit to use.\n\n“He who sits in a game of chance with a two-dollar bill in his pocket is thought to be saddled with a jinx,” the New York Times said in a 1925 article. “They have been avoided as ill-starred.”\n\nThe two was also known for keeping controversial company. It was associated with gambling, where it was the standard bet at racetracks, and prostitution.\n\nAnd during the nineteenth century, crony candidates frequently used $2 bills to bribe voters. Someone holding a $2 bill was thought to have sold a vote to a crooked politician.\n\nThe Treasury Department during the 1900s tried unsuccessfully several times to popularize the use of the $2 bill. In 1966, it gave up and discontinued printing the bills “because a lack of public demand.”\n\nBut a decade later, as the United States approached the bicentennial, the Treasury designed a new $2 bill series with a portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.\n\nThe aim was to cut the number of $1 bills in circulation and save the Treasury money on production costs.\n\nBut the relaunch in 1976 failed. People viewed the new version as a collector’s item and hoarded them instead of going out and spending them.\n\nThe Postal Service offered to stamp them only on April 13, the first day they were issued in honor of Jefferson’s birthday, unintentionally adding to the idea that they were commemorative bills -— a misconception that continues to this day.\n\n“The press and public now tend to link the $2 bill with the Susan B. Anthony dollar under the general heading of ‘fiascos,’” the New York Times said in 1981.\n\nThere’s no rational reason why $2 bills aren’t as popular as other bills, said Paolo Pasquariello, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan. But people exhibit a preference for multiples of 1 and 5, he said.\n\nAnother reason $2 bills never took off: Cash registers, invented in the late 1800s, were never designed with a place to hold them, so cashiers didn’t know where to stash them.\n\n“There wasn’t an alteration of cash registers for $2 bills,” said Heather McCabe. “The infrastructure of paying for things didn’t change. There was not an adjustment of how people work with that bill.”\n\nIf cash registers had a familiar slot for $2 bills, the bill would be more popular, she argued.\n\n$2 subculture\n\nBut there are people who swear by $2 bills. In fact, communities and subcultures have developed around them.\n\nUS Air Force pilots who fly U-2 spy planes always keep a $2 bill in their flight suits.\n\nSince the 1970s, fans of Clemson University’s Tigers football team have paid and tipped with $2 bills -— “Tiger Twos” — in other cities’ restaurants, bars, shops and hotels. The tradition started as a way to prove to Georgia Tech in Atlanta that it would benefit the city to schedule games against Clemson.\n\n“There is a degree of popularity to them. There is a sense of excitement,” said Jesse Kraft, a curator at the American Numismatic Society. “But as far as putting them back into circulation, that’s the key that’s missing.”\n\nKraft is a proponent of adopting $2 bills more widely.\n\nClemson fans mark their \"Tiger Two's\" with orange paws from a stamp pad and spend them to give businesses on the road the idea of their economic impact. Ken Ruinard/The Greenville News/USA Today Network\n\nHe notes that it’s about half as expensive for the Treasury to print a $2 bill than higher denominations, which come with costlier security features on the paper. It’s also more efficient to print $2 bills than $1 bills because the Treasury can print twice as much for the same amount of money and requires less storage.\n\nJohn Bennardo, who made a 2015 film about $2 bills called “The Two Dollar Bill Documentary,” has made it his mission to “educate people and enlighten them and start using $2 bills in their life.”\n\nIn short, he concludes, $2 bills are underappreciated in the United States and a way for strangers to meet and engage.\n\n“You will get remembered if you use a $2 bill,” Bennardo said. “It has this ability to connect people in way that other bills don’t. It opens up a dialogue between you and the cashier.”\n\n“It’s a practical bill with inflation. But it’s social currency as well.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/09/23/covid-vaccine-insurance-denials-cancellations/70918394007/", "title": "Consumers seeking COVID vaccine face insurance denials ...", "text": "Some consumers trying to get updated versions of the COVID-19 vaccine this week have encountered red tape, canceled appointments and delays getting private insurance to cover the shots.\n\nThe major snarl comes amid a systemic shift, as the federal government no longer pays for or distributes all COVID-19 vaccinations. Public and private-sector health insurance providers must pay the full cost of the shot plus an administrative fee. Uninsured patients can still get free shots through a federal government program. In response to an uptick in cases, the Biden administration announced plans Monday to restart another federal program that allows consumers to order four free tests per household.\n\nMillions of doses of the updated vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been shipped to pharmacies and clinics since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved new versions. The agency has recommended that everyone older than 6 months get updated shots, which target more recent variants of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nWhile chain pharmacies busily give customers their shots, it's been stressful for many people looking to get vaccinated. Dozens have turned to social media to share stories about insurer roadblocks, delays in appointments or out-of-network denials.\n\nExperts say the marketplace is bound to experience hiccups with such a large vaccine rollout shifting from government to private-sector insurers.\n\n\"It's pretty much par for the course with the U.S. health care system and the patchwork nature of it,\" said Sabrina Corlette, founder, and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\n'Very difficult to be responsible'\n\nPatrick Dye, a resident of Vienna, Virginia, began making calls as soon as the new vaccine shots became available but he hit roadblock after roadblock.\n\nWhen he learned his doctor's office didn't carry the vaccine, he contacted his insurer, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, to ask about options. The insurer told him he'd only be covered if he got a shot from his \"health provider\" or the doctor, who had already told him his office didn't have the updated shot.\n\nIn all, Dye made more than a half dozen calls to his doctor, insurer, a hospital clinic affiliated with his doctor, Walgreens and an independent pharmacy. He finally was able to get a shot Friday at a CVS pharmacy. He said his situation was complicated by the fact that he has a low-deductible, pre-Affordable Care Act health insurance plan, known as a grandfathered plan, which operates under different rules than ACA plans.\n\nStill, he said consumers shouldn't have to work so hard to get vaccinated to protect themselves and others.\n\n\"It's very difficult to be responsible,\" Dye said.\n\nHealth expert struggles to get vaccinated\n\nAs vice president and director of the ACA at the health policy foundation KFF, Cynthia Cox is well versed in the nuances of the health insurance industry and U.S. health care system.\n\nYet even she struggled to get a timely shot.\n\nShe tried to get vaccinated on Tuesday ahead of a work trip next week, but her health insurer's in-network pharmacies didn't have any vaccines in stock.\n\nShe was willing to pay the $200 out of pocket at a Washington D.C.-area Walgreens pharmacy that wasn't part of her insurer's network. When she attempted to do so, the Walgreens employee contacted her insurer, and a representative for the insurance provider informed Cox that she would need prior authorization to get vaccinated out of network. The insurer even requested that Cox track down her doctor's fax number as part of the process.\n\nThe end result – Cox didn't get the shot, even though she was willing to pay out of pocket. She couldn't land an appointment at local CVS stores, and staff at a non-chain pharmacy told her they wouldn't get doses until next week.\n\nShe searched her insurer's directory of in-network pharmacies that carry the shot, and she found one in Baltimore, a trip \"that's not really a solution for the vast majority of people who live in or around Washington D.C.,\" she said.\n\n\"It was ultimately the insurance bureaucracy that kept me from being able to get the shot, despite the fact that I've been working on insurance policy for over a decade,\" Cox said.\n\nBiden administration, insurers vow improvements\n\nBiden administration officials, health insurers and pharmacies have acknowledged early bumps in the rollout.\n\nA U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said the agency is aware some vaccine seekers had \"unexpected insurance coverage denials at the point of service.\" The federal agency has reached out to insurers to make sure computer systems are up to date and remind them they must cover COVID-19 vaccines without cost sharing to insured consumers. For the uninsured, the CDC's \"bridge access\" program will pay for vaccines.\n\nIn July, Chiquita Brooks-LaSure , administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, sent a letter to insurers, urging them to update systems by mid- to late-September to be ready for the vaccine's release.\n\nHealth insurers will cover the full cost of the shot \"when obtained through a network provider,\" said James Swann, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group that represents major private health insurers. He added that insurers are working with pharmacies and others to \"quickly ensure patient access to COVID-19 vaccines with zero cost sharing and address any issues relating to newly added billing codes quickly.\"\n\nCVS spokesman Matt Blanchette said some insurers' systems aren't yet set up to cover the updated vaccine. In such cases, consumers can pay cash or pharmacy techs can reschedule appointments.\n\nCVS stores have been administering the updated COVID shots since last week and continue to get shipments of doses. Consumers can check CVS.com to confirm whether a store has vaccine doses and make an appointment, Blanchette said.\n\nA Walgreens spokesman said the pharmacy is \"committed to ensuring no patient pays and everyone who is eligible and wants a vaccine receives one.\"\n\nConsumers scramble for shots\n\nJoe Anderson Jr., 36, a health clinic director in Austin, planned to attend the coveted Beyoncé tour in New Orleans next week. To be safe, he wanted to get a COVID-19 booster, even if it wouldn’t provide full protection until a week later.\n\nHe found that city, county and federal government websites had little information about boosters, and his private insurance portal and major retailers such as CVS and Walgreens didn't have much either. On Wednesday night, a Walgreens representative called him to say his appointment the next day was canceled, forcing him to scramble for another vaccine in the Austin area.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, he found an appointment at a Walgreens and was unsure whether his insurance would cover it. But when he showed up for the shot, the pharmacy didn't ask him to pay anything out-of-pocket. He then scheduled an appointment Friday for his mother in Dallas.\n\nThough it took a little work and a little luck to find an appointment, his persistence paid off.\n\n“It’s kinda like we have to ask them,” he said. “And it’s really reactionary instead of being proactive.”\n\nCOVID cases, testing on the upswing\n\nThe new vaccines arrived as COVID-19 infections continued to rise, since early July, but the infection rate remains far below previous peaks. Hospitalizations were up 7.7% during the week ending Sept. 7 and COVID deaths were up 12.5% in the week ending Sept. 16, but totals remain lower than during previous upticks.\n\nIn another indicator of concern for public health officials: the share of positive COVID tests climbed from about 4% in early June to over 14% as of Sept. 9. The CDC testing data typically doesn't include home COVID tests unless someone visits a doctor who orders a test through a lab.\n\nConsumers can request their four free COVID home tests per household beginning Monday through the government-run website CovidTests.gov. The federal government plans to award $600 million to a dozen domestic COVID-19 test manufacturers to shore up the government's supply of these tests. The availability comes as chain retailers have reported periodic shortages of home tests.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/04/30/fafsa-changes-2024-25/11760352002/", "title": "FAFSA form to be simplified for 2024-25 year. Will it mean less aid?", "text": "A new, simplified Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form is coming in December.\n\nAlong with the easier-to-complete form, there'll be changes in how your aid is calculated.\n\nMost people will get more money for school, but some will lose out. Here's how it breaks down.\n\nAs families finalize college decisions and line up financing for 2023-2024, some might want to start thinking about the following academic year because aid may be tougher to get.\n\nAlong with the launch in December of a simplified Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form to request financial help for the 2024-25 year, the Department of Education is also changing its formula to determine who will qualify for aid and how much they’ll receive. The changes fulfill legislation passed in 2020 aiming to make student aid easier to get.\n\nWhile students overall will gain billions in funds, students with siblings in college likely could lose some financial aid, according to a recent analysis by the research group Brookings Institution.\n\n“These changes, and others, will have profound effects on students’ eligibility for financial aid,” Brookings said. “There will be winners and losers,” and those students who may end up paying more “are unlikely to know that these changes are coming.”\n\nCollege worth:Is college worth it? Scorecard changes could give prospective students the encouragement they need.\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nWaiting on forgiveness:With Biden's student loan debt forgiveness in limbo, lawmakers consider colleges' role\n\nWho’s the biggest loser?\n\nSome students with siblings in college could be hard hit, researchers say.\n\nStudents at the lowest income levels won’t be affected, but people or their parents with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 will see reduced Pell Grants, according to nonpartisan EconoFact, a publication that analyzes economic and social policies.\n\nBeyond that, the amount of aid from schools that these students will be eligible for “could be reduced by thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands of dollars, relative to the current formula,” EconoFact said.\n\nThe reductions are due to the elimination of what’s called the sibling discount. The expected family contribution is reduced proportionally to the number of that student’s siblings who are enrolled in college, but the new calculation doesn’t consider siblings.\n\nFor example, if a family had two members in college and had an expected family contribution of $5,000, that total was split between the two college-going individuals. Under the new formula, that contribution would be for each family member in college, increasing the financial burden for families with more than one member in college. In addition, it may affect their eligibility for some financial aid programs.\n\nSaving for college:Stranded college savings plan can soon be rescued. New law lets 529 dollars roll into retirement\n\nPlease, hold:When student loan repayment starts, servicers predict long wait times, advise early action\n\nBrookings estimated that almost 900,000 students with one sibling in college will maintain eligibility for financial aid under the new formula. Those students stand to lose almost $3,000 each in institutional grant aid, totaling $2.5 billion. Another 157,000 will lose all eligibility, which could have provided up to $7,900 each in aid, totaling $1.2 billion, Brookings said.\n\n“Students with siblings in college will ... stand to lose thousands of dollars in financial aid,” Brooking said. Students already in college “will be shocked by the large increase in their net price.”\n\nOf course, schools could choose to reinstate temporarily or permanently the sibling discount, but that could create a budgetary problem. “Without the provision eliminating the sibling discount, FAFSA simplification will increase eligibility for institutional grant aid, not reduce it,” it said.\n\nProve your worth:'Prove you're a low-income student': After filing FAFSA, some college students are audited\n\nOther money:California helps college students cut their debt by paying them to help their communities\n\nWho else might lose?\n\nFamilies with an adjusted gross income of $60,000 and own farms or small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Those items would now be added to what the government considers financial assets, which could then be used to pay for college on FAFSA. Currently, those assets are exempted.\n\nFor example, a family with a farm valued at $1 million would be expected to contribute more than $7,600 toward an education. Under the new rules, that same family would be responsible for more than $41,000, potentially making those students ineligible for some federal and state aid programs and more reliant on student loans.\n\nIn late April, U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Jon Tester, D-Mont., and five others introduced the Family Farm and Small Business Exemption Act to reverse those FAFSA changes, saying farm assets are unlike other liquid assets that can be sold easily for cash.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture says family farms account for almost 96% of the farms in the U.S. and about 87% have gross annual sales under $250,000.\n\nMore help available:You can still get student loan forgiveness in these states even if Biden's debt plan fails\n\nCredit dent:Student loan forgiveness could ding your credit score.

Here's how borrowers should prepare.\n\nWhat changes will promote eligibility?\n\nLarger income protection allowances (IPA): IPA covers a family’s basic daily living expenses and is excluded from the financial aid eligibility formula. Larger IPAs lower the income students and parents can contribute to college expenses, which will increase their financial aid eligibility.\n\nIPA will increase by 20% for parents, up to about $2,400 (35%) for most students, and up to about $6,500 (60%) for students who are single parents.\n\nAutomatic Pell Grants based on income and household size: Families making less than 175% and single parents making less than 225% of the federal poverty level will receive the maximum award, while minimum grants will be guaranteed to students from a household earning below 275%, 325%, 350%, or 400% of the poverty level, depending on the household structure. This makes it quicker and easier for people to know they’re eligible. The Pell Grant is the federal government’s primary grant aimed at low- and middle-income students, helping more than 6 million students afford college in the 2021-22 school year.\n\nState Higher Education Executive Officers, a national association that helps develop education policies, projects that 42.9% of students previously ineligible for a Pell Grant may become eligible under the new calculation. That's approximately 2.1 million more students than under the old formula, it said.\n\nPell Grant awards in the middle ranges of eligibility would be determined the same way they are now, by using assets to calculate what families can contribute to college.\n\nRestoring Pell eligibility : Incarcerated students and students who have been convicted of drug-related offenses will be eligible again for financial aid.\n\n: Incarcerated students and students who have been convicted of drug-related offenses will be eligible again for financial aid. A negative contribution score : Family contribution amounts could be as low as minus $1,500, instead of zero.

Although federal financial aid cannot exceed the cost of college attendance, the negative score could be used to distinguish among the neediest students, allowing states and institutions to more accurately target need-based aid. Simpler FAFSA application: The application will be pared down to just 36 questions from an unwieldy 108, including detailed financial information, and make it easier to import income data from tax records. A shortened, streamlined FAFSA is expected to lead to increased completion rates and improve college access and affordability by making billions of dollars of financial aid available to students. A study by NerdWallet found that the high school graduating class of 2018 missed out on $2.6 billion in available federal aid because eligible students did not complete the FAFSA.\n\nJust don't go there:Is it possible to avoid student debt?

Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2021/07/02/congress-credit-score-overhaul-proposal-act/46965135/", "title": "Credit score overhaul: New bill aims to put government in charge", "text": "Amid all of this week's news, one potentially game-changing piece of legislation seemed to slip under the radar: the idea of dramatically overhauling the U.S. credit reporting industry.\n\n\"Good credit is a gateway to wealth,\" said House Committee on Financial Services chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said Tuesday. \"Yet, for far too long, our credit reporting system has kept people of color and low-income persons from access to capital to start a small business; access to mortgage loans to become homeowners; and access to credit to meet financial emergencies.\"\n\nWaters added that the House passed two bills out of the committee before the pandemic – the Comprehensive CREDIT Act and the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2021– which \"provide long overdue reforms to our credit reporting system.\"\n\nBoth bills are now back under consideration.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Waters and her committee heard from consumer-protection advocates like Chi Chi Wu of the National Consumer Law Center, who proposed replacing the privately-run three-credit bureau system with a public credit registry. It would operate under the umbrella of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which guards consumers against unfair or abusive practices.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\n\"While public agencies are not perfect, at least they would not have profit-making as their top priority,\" Wu told the House Committee on Financial Services during her testimony. \"They would be responsive to public pressure and government oversight. They could also be charged with developing credit scoring models to reduce the yawning racial and economic inequality in this country.\"\n\nWu added, \"The fact that these are private, profit-seeking companies explains why the credit bureaus are constantly expanding their products into uses, such as employment, insurance, and tenant screening, that ultimately harm Americans and contribute to the massive inequality in our nation.\"\n\nWaters noted that creating a credit reporting agency that is consumer-oriented \"would be a major upgrade over today’s broken, biased credit reporting system.\"\n\nIn addition to the single credit bureau idea, Wu also proposed several other policies, that, if implemented, could improve the financial lives of Americans struggling to improve their credit scores and financial lives:\n\nProhibiting the use of credit score information for purposes unrelated to credit decisions . This means most employers could no longer use credit reports in their candidate screening process.\n\n.

Protect economic victims of COVID-19. The lawmakers hope to put a moratorium on the reporting of negative information incurred during the pandemic and other disasters.\n\nTo illustrate the impact of COVID on consumer credit, Waters shared a story:\n\nLast week, I received a letter from a gentleman in Ohio. In this letter, he explained how he had lost his job because of the pandemic. Without his salary, and with no help from any of his creditors, he couldn’t afford to cover all of his bills. Though he had never before missed a credit card payment, his credit score has suffered so badly, he wrote – and I quote – 'I couldn’t get credit now if I paid someone to give me credit.'. He closed his letter by asking what this Committee was doing to protect consumers like him.\n\nHow things work now\n\nCurrently, Americans have multiple scores from each of the three major reporting bureaus. Scoring models vary in how which factors are weighted more heavily but all credit scores are used to evaluate a person's ability to manage credit and debt. They're used to decide who gets a car or home loan, credit cards, apartment.\n\nThese factors include:\n\nPayment history (Are you consistently on time or late paying your bills?)\n\n(Are you consistently on time or late paying your bills?) Credit utilization (How much of your total credit are you currently using?)\n\n(How much of your total credit are you currently using?) Length of credit history (How long have your credit cards and loans been open and are they in good standing?)\n\n(How long have your credit cards and loans been open and are they in good standing?) New credit (Have you been frequently applying for credit lately?)\n\n(Have you been frequently applying for credit lately?) Credit mix (Do you have a variety of credit, such as loans and credit cards?)\n\nThe goal: Eliminate errors, ensure fair practices, end confusion\n\nFixing mistakes on a credit report (let alone, all 3 versions) can be a byzantine system of filling out forms and phone calls.\n\n\"The fact that their customers are creditors and other users of information explains the unacceptable error rates and bias against consumers who complain about errors,\" Wu argued, adding that, \"if consumers are not able to obtain legal redress for FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) violations, a key means of enforcement disappears, making the broken credit reporting system much, much harder to fix. A public credit registry would replace or provide an alternative to this broken system.\"\n\nBoth Wu and Waters referenced a recent Supreme Court decision, which narrowed the case brought by an Arizona man who had successfully sued Transunion for relief after a car dealership's credit check incorrectly flagged him as being on a terrorist watchlist.\n\nBut even smaller errors can cost you over the long haul in the form of higher interest rates on mortgages and car loans – or possibly getting a mortgage or rent application denied, even if you satisfy the income requirements.\n\nCrucial FICO scores in need of updates\n\nIn order to help consumes protect their credit during the pandemic, the bureaus have extended the availability of free credit reports until 2022. However, these reports usually do not include your FICO scores. Those you usually have to pay the credit bureaus for – especially if you want to see the ones that will be used when you go to buy that house or car and get an idea of which rate your qualify for.\n\nAnother problem related to mortgages: Although both FICO and Vantage scores have been recalibrated to reduce the impact of medical debt, those aren't the ones used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the mortgage-underwriting process. So to streamline the process, many lenders use the same less-forgiving FICO 5 (Equifax), 4 (Transunion) and 2 (Experian) scores and often take your middle score. And again, these are scores that consumers usually have to pay to see. They're also used to evaluate rental applications.\n\nYour credit score also impacts your auto insurance payment, determining whether you can afford to drive that car to work. It might even factor into whether you get that job.\n\n\"It’s essentially the report card for a consumer’s financial life,\" Wu said. \"Yet for such an important record, credit reports and scores suffer from profound problems and abuses.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2022/08/24/bidens-student-debt-forgiveness-what-to-know/7876380001/", "title": "Do I qualify for student loan forgiveness?

If you received a Pell Grant, you can get up to $20,000 forgiven.\n\nIf you're not eligible for any student debt forgiveness, your pause on repayments continues to be paused until year end. The Department of Education is also working on a proposal introducing a new repayment plan to ease the burden on borrowers.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic in 2020, borrowers haven't had to pay a cent on their federal student loans. During this time, the pressure grew for the president to cancel the debt. It was one of the platforms Biden ran on for president in 2020.\n\nThough the plan was welcomed by many, it still garnered criticism. Many had sought higher forgiveness amounts – $50,000 or even all amounts, no matter how large.

Borrowers who provide an email address at studentaid.gov are to receive an email notification when the application is available. Applications can take four to six weeks to process. The pause on federal student loan repayments terminates Dec. 31.\n\nBorrowers will have more than a year to apply once the application form is available.\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be automatically eligible to receive relief because relevant income data is already available to the Department of Education.\n\nWhat’s Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan?\n\nIndividuals with an annual income of less than $125,000 (or under $250,000 for married couples or heads of households) are entitled to have up to $10,000 in federal student loans canceled. No private loans will be forgiven.\n\nThose who received a Pell Grant in college will be eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation.\n\nFor those who still have student debt, the repayment pause since March 2020 will be extended to the end of the year. Borrowers will resume payments in January.\n\nBIDEN COLLEGE CAREER:Biden mentions own education in loan relief speech\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWhat is a Pell Grant?\n\nFederal funding that’s usually awarded only to students who display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate or professional degree. Sometimes, a student enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program might receive a Pell Grant.\n\nUnlike a loan, a Pell Grant does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances. Those include a change in enrollment status or if you received outside scholarships or grants that reduced your need for federal student aid.\n\nPELL GRANTS:Who qualifies? What to know from Biden student loan plan\n\nAre current students eligible for loan forgiveness?\n\nLoans awarded to current students and graduates with undergraduate, graduate and Parent PLUS loans are eligible, so long as the loans were disbursed on or before June 30, 2022. Consolidated loans must contain only underlying loans disbursed on or before June 30, 2022 to qualify.\n\nWhat's the cost of student loan forgiveness?\n\nA one-time maximum debt forgiveness of $10,000 per borrower will cost the U.S. government around $300 billion for borrowers with incomes less than $125,000, according to analysis published on Tuesday by Junlei Chen and Kent Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, based at the University of Pennsylvania. This cost increases to $330 billion if the program continues over the standard 10-year budget window.\n\nBefore the announcement, the Government Accountability Office estimated that alone, the payment pause since the start of the pandemic cost the government $102 billion. That amount included suspending all payments due, interest accrual and involuntary collections for loans in default from March 13, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2022.\n\nWho benefits most from the student debt forgiveness plan?\n\nMostly higher-income households. Between 69% and 73% of the debt forgiven accrues to households in the top 60% of the income distribution, Chen and Smetters said.\n\nA New York Federal Reserve study in April, though, said that the income cap to the forgiveness \"substantially reduces the cost of student loan forgiveness and increases the share of benefit going to borrowers who are more likely to struggle repaying their debts.\"\n\nFor example, an income cap of $75,000 for a $10,000 cancellation raises the share of forgiven loan dollars going to borrowers in low-income neighborhoods to 35% from 25% and the share going to lower credit score borrowers to 42% from 37%, it said.\n\nIncome caps also increase the share of loans forgiven that were delinquent before the pandemic to 60% from 34%.\n\nLIFE'S NOT FAIR:Is student loan forgiveness fair to those without college degrees? Americans remain divided over costs\n\nAVOIDING STUDENT DEBT:Middle class, minus debt: Apprenticeships, certificates offer low-cost option to college\n\nHow many Americans have student loans outstanding?\n\nAbout 45 million Americans hold federal student loan debt, according to federal data. The loan forgiveness plan should provide relief to about 43 million borrowers and cancel the full remaining balance for nearly 45% of those borrowers.\n\nThe total outstanding balance for federally owned (including defaulted) student loans in December 2021 was $1.38 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in April.\n\nMost (67%) student loan borrowers are under 40 years old, but 57% of all balances are owed by those under 40. That means those with larger balances are more likely to be older or to have taken out loans for graduate school, it said.\n\nThe White House estimates that its initiative will cancel the full remaining balance for roughly 20 million borrowers.\n\nWhat’s the average outstanding student loan debt amount?\n\nThe average federal student loan debt balance is $37,667 while the total average balance (including private loan debt) may be as high as $40,274, according to Education Data Initiative, which collects data and statistics about the U.S. education system.\n\nDISSECTING STUDENT LOANS:Free college or federal student loans? These alternatives could help solve student debt crisis\n\nPOLITICAL FORGIVENESS:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nIs student loan forgiveness taxable?\n\nThe debt relief isn’t counted as taxable income for federal income tax purposes, the White House says.\n\nWould canceling student loan debt increase inflation?\n\nSome prominent economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, who was chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have been vocal critics, saying student debt forgiveness would stoke 40-year high inflation and may be unfair.\n\n“Student loan relief is not free,” Furman tweeted on Aug. 19. “Part of it would be paid for by the 87% of Americans who do not benefit but lose out from inflation. Part of it would be paid for by future spending cuts & tax increases—with uncertainty about who will bear those costs.”\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Biden’s plan “would more than undo the deflationary pressures from the Inflation Reduction Act and add 0.15 percentage points of additional inflation in the near-term,” noted Sarah Foster, Bankrate analyst.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive rate-raising cycle to cool demand, but giving people spending money could stymie that effort.\n\nAnd those economists aren't the only ones worried. Hit already by hefty inflation, 59% of Americans are concerned student loan forgiveness will make inflation worse, according to a CNBC survey, conducted online by Momentive among a national sample of 5,142 adults from Aug. 4 to 15.\n\nEVERYDAY GETS EXPENSIVE:These everyday items saw the biggest price increases from inflation in July, CPI report shows\n\nJOB WORRIES:With 80% of workers afraid of losing jobs during a recession, business owners trim costs\n\nWhat is discretionary income?\n\nThe money you have left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount of money you have left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on your discretionary income.\n\nDISCRETIONARY INCOME:What is it? Why it matters in student loan repayment.\n\nIf you qualify for student debt forgiveness, what should you do with any extra money?\n\n“Student loan forgiveness will likely decrease your monthly payment or get rid of it entirely,” said Dan Casey of Bridgeriver Advisors in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.\n\nTake that freed up money to pay off high-interest debt like credit cards, build up your emergency fund, or invest it in your retirement.

The White House has warned that this will be the final extension.\n\n\"It’s time for the payments to resume,\" Biden said Wednesday.\n\nBorrowers who qualify for the payment pause and loan forgiveness should stop paying off loans if they owe less than the $10,000 cap (or $20,000 cap, for Pell Grant recipients) to take full advantage of the loan forgiveness program.\n\nOthers who earn more than $125,000 (or $250,000, for married couples) or have more than $10,000 in loans (or $20,000, for Pell Grant recipients) should be ready to start making loan payments again.\n\n\"We recommend to continue making payments for now if you can afford to because these payments go 100% toward principal until January,\" said Isabel Barrow, director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"While it’s impossible to know what will happen in the future, such as another forgiveness program, we would not recommend delaying or stopping loan payments in anticipation of future changes.\"\n\nThere is also subset of borrowers who did not have their loans paused. These borrowers should continue to make loan payments \"to keep the loan in good standing,\" according to Ameriprise financial private wealth advisor Rebecca Hall.\n\nLoans not eligible for the COVID-19 payment pause include:\n\nNondefaulted Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nDefaulted and Nondefaulted federal Perkins loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nNondefaulted Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) loans\n\nPrivate student loans\n\nWhich student loans do not qualify for forgiveness?\n\nThe Department of Education says the \"vast majority\" of borrowers with loans held by the department are eligible for forgiveness, including those in the following programs:\n\nWilliam D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program\n\nFederal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program (if held by the Department of Education or commercial guaranty agencies or lenders)\n\nFederal Perkins Loan Program (if held by the Department of Education)\n\nTeacher Education Assistance for College Education and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program Grants do not qualify for forgiveness unless they have been converted to direct unsubsidized loans.\n\nThe Biden administration is working to determine whether borrowers with other Federal student loan programs will be eligible to receive loan discharges, according to an emailed statement from a Department of Education spokesperson.\n\n\"Over the next couple of months, the Department of Education will work with private lenders to ensure commercially-held federal student loan borrowers can also benefit from relief,\" the email reads. \"In the meantime, borrowers with privately-held FFEL, Perkins, and HEAL loans consolidating into the Direct Loan program will be eligible for relief.\"\n\nCAN'T AFFORD IT:Is college worth it? Americans say they value higher education, but it's too expensive for many\n\nI paid off student loans recently. Am I eligible for a refund?\n\nThe federal government first announced the student loan payment pause on March 13, 2020. The U.S. Department of Education says borrowers who made payments during the pause – including auto-debit payments – can request a refund with their loan servicer.\n\nBorrowers can look up their loan servicer on the agency’s website.\n\nIf you don’t qualify, should you start repaying in January?\n\n“If you haven’t made a student loan payment since the pause began, it’s important to understand how much you’ll owe each month,” Daniel Milan, advisor at Cornerstone Financial Services, said.\n\nThen, review the interest rates on your loans and start paying off the highest interest ones first, enrolling in autopay so you don’t miss any payments while you get back into the habit of paying regularly and consider refinancing if it lowers your payments.\n\n“Moving multiple loans into one loan can also help you keep better track of how much you actually owe,” he said.\n\nSTOKING INFLATION?:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nWhat’s ahead for future borrowers?\n\nTo “substantially” reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers and protect more income from loan payments, the Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nHere are some things being proposed:\n\nCutting the amount borrowers have to repay each month and curbing interest so a balance won't grow so long as borrowers make their required monthly payments.​​​\n\n\n\nLoan balance forgiveness after 10 years, instead of 20, under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. This will allow nearly all community college borrowers to be debt-free within 10 years, the White House said.\n\n\n\nStarting next summer, the Department of Education can automatically pull borrower’s income information each year, avoiding the hassle of needing to recertify their income annually and make it easier for borrowers to stay enrolled.\n\n\n\nPublic servants will also have an easier time claiming credits for time of service to go toward debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The Department of Education has already made some temporary changes toward that end. To apply for forgiveness or payments to count toward forgiveness under the temporary changes, visit the PSLF Help Tool.\n\nA full list of proposed regulations will be published in the coming days on the Federal Register, and the public is invited to comment on the draft rule for 30 days.\n\nTRUE COST OF COLLEGE:It's not just tuition and fees: College students are facing increasingly high rent prices, too\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWould Parents PLUS loans be forgiven?\n\nParent PLUS loans are federal student loans issued directly to parents with dependents in school, meant to supplement school, state and other federal financial aid offered for a dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half-time.\n\nParent PLUS loans held by the Department of Education are included in the cancellation policy, along with federal graduate and undergraduate loans.\n\nWhat’s being done to keep the cost of college from spiraling?\n\nThe Department of Education will publish an annual watch list of programs with the worst debt levels in the country, so students registering for the next academic year can steer clear of programs with poor outcomes. It will also request plans from colleges with the most concerning debt outcomes on how they intend to lower debt levels.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

It's complicated | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and other politicians will tell you inflation is Corporate America’s fault. Corporate America blames the administration’s pandemic assistance programs for putting too much cash into the economy.\n\nThe reality, economists say, is that it’s all of those things. And more.\n\nWhichever of the two main inflation gauges you read — the Consumer Price Index or the Fed-preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -— the verdict is the same: inflation has soared to a nearly four-decade high.\n\nInflation isn’t inherently a bad thing. In the United States, for the past 40 years or so (and the better part of this century), we’ve been living with an ideal low-and-slow level of inflation that comes with a well-oiled consumer-driven economy, with prices going up around 2% a year, if that. The current surge in prices reflects an economy roaring back to its fighting weight. What concerns economists and policymakers is when prices keep rising, and when wages don’t rise in kind.\n\nAlthough wages broadly are also going up, they so far haven’t kept pace with the rising costs of food, energy, housing and everyday consumer goods. People are, understandably, frustrated. Although there’s no one single culprit to blame, here are some of the forces — Covid-19, greedy businesses, the supply chain crisis, the government — you can take your rage out on.\n\nThe pandemic\n\nThis is an easy one. The pandemic upended everything about our lives, and when the world shut down in the spring of 2020, it was like pulling the plug on the global economy.\n\nBut by that summer, demand for consumer goods started to rebound. Big time. Congress and President Biden passed an historic $1.9 trillion stimulus bill in March that put cash directly in Americans’ wallets. And rather than spending money on travel or dining out, we spent on stuff. Lots and lots of it.\n\nDemand went from zero to 100, but supplies couldn’t bounce back so easily. Factories were on lockdown or navigating Covid-19 restrictions, and raw materials were harder to get because of the sudden swell in demand. Shortages of just about everything cropped up, especially workers to unload goods and drive them to their destination. We’re still untangling the mess at ports around the world.\n\nCorporate America\n\nIt can feel morally satisfying and politically convenient to blame Corporate America. After all, profit margins are up across industries even as the costs of production have risen.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the largest publicly traded US companies have reported fatter profit margins so far this year than in the same period in 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal. In other words, even as costs for raw materials, labor and transportation have increased in response to the pandemic, a lot big corporations are offsetting those costs by raising prices on consumers.\n\nAlthough analysts say it’s almost impossible to verify how much price increases reflect rising production costs versus a desire to juice profits, companies aren’t exactly hiding their price flexes. In fact, some are on record bragging about their “pricing power” — corporate-speak for sticking customers with a bigger bill.\n\nDemocrats and consumer advocates are calling these companies out. Earlier this week, Senator Elizabeth Warren blasted Hertz for spending $2 billion on a stock buyback — a common but controversial way to reward shareholders — rather than investing its excess cash in rebuilding its fleet, which could bring down record-high prices for consumers.\n\nAlthough there’s some truth to the argument that corporations are making inflation worse, there is a bigger structural problem underpinning the issue: for decades, lax antitrust enforcement has put the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few giants.\n\n“Viewed this way, the underlying problem isn’t inflation per se. It’s lack of competition,” wrote Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, in an op-ed for the Guardian last month. “Corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits.”\n\nThe Biden Administration\n\nRepublicans have been hammering Democrats and the Biden White House on inflation.\n\nAfter Friday’s price index report came out, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wasted no time when it came to pointing fingers. “It is unthinkable that Senate Democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days,” he tweeted.\n\nIt’s true that government spending boosts inflation, but economists have pushed back on the idea that Biden’s ambitious social safety net expansion will inflame price surges. “Worries that the plan will ignite undesirably high inflation and an overheating economy are overdone,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in July.\n\nMoody’s analysts noted that government spending on items such as rental housing for low-income Americans, reducing prescription drug costs and making childcare more affordable is aimed at cooling off prices and easing shortages.\n\nRepublicans blaming inflation on Biden are also conveniently forgetting the trillions of dollars in spending passed in 2020 supported by Republicans and signed by then-President Donald Trump, which economists say have also contributed to inflation.\n\nThe Fed\n\nMoney has essentially been free for the past year and a half, thanks to the Fed’s double-barrel shotgun approach to economic stimulus — interest rates near zero and a massive investment in bonds that keeps yields near rock-bottom.\n\nThat stimulus has staved off a lot of financial and economic pain, and was always meant to be temporary. But for months the Fed brushed off inflation concerns, vaguely dubbing price surges “transitory” before that word became almost comically devoid of meaning.\n\nThe Fed is finally tapping the breaks. Last month, Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress “the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high,” so it would be appropriate to consider tapering its asset purchases more aggressively.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/24/president-biden-groceries-online-snap-benefits/4235153001/", "title": "President Biden increased SNAP, but many can't buy groceries online", "text": "When the coronavirus first hit, Miranda Wilt knew a grocery store run could be fatal to her children.\n\nBoth 10-year-old Aiden and 8-year-old Rosie are on the autism spectrum and legally disabled. Wilt, a 35-year-old single mom, said she's too scared to leave the house herself, let alone go outside with her kids, who can't wear face masks.\n\nShe turned to online grocery shopping to stay safe, but her monthly SNAP allotment of $55 barely covers the family's essential needs, and that's before the tip and delivery fee.\n\n\"I have no other choice. I have a child who has a disease that has no treatment and no cure,\" Wilt said.\n\nThe federal government has said Americans should stay home and buy groceries online, leading to a 300% explosion in online food shopping. But a majority of Americans who depend on food stamps have no choice but to shop in person because the federal government allows online shopping with SNAP benefits only in limited circumstances in 47 states. For those who are able to shop on the web, the costs can be shocking for families who barely have enough to eat in part because SNAP benefits cannot be used to pay for delivery fees or tips.\n\n\"Groceries have just gone up dramatically, your milk, your eggs,\" Wilt said. \"You're looking at $15 for a delivery fee.\"\n\nOf 38 million Americans receiving food stamps, only 1.4 million have been able to purchase food online since 2019, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture began allowing SNAP recipients to shop for food on the web under a limited pilot program.\n\nOn Friday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on the USDA to expand and extend federal nutrition assistance programs to help millions of Americans who have become unemployed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the order made no mention of online food shopping access. Last week, Biden called to extend SNAP benefits until the end of the year as part of his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package to Congress.\n\nWith more than 414,000 COVID-19 deaths and climbing in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend people avoid shopping for groceries in person. Leslie M. Kantor, professor at Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey, said new contact tracing out of the United Kingdom showed the most frequent location people had visited before testing positive for the coronavirus was a supermarket.\n\n50 million Americans struggle with food insecurity\n\nThe coronavirus didn't cause the country's hunger problem, but it has made it much worse. Before the pandemic, more than 35 million people struggled with food insecurity. Now that number is closer to 50 million, and it's worse among people of color, according to a recent report by Feeding America, a hunger relief organization. In many cases, people living on the poverty line – defined as $26,174 for a family of four – are essential workers, don't have health insurance or live in multigenerational homes, factors that all make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nThirty-one percent of U.S. households, or roughly 40 million people, buy groceries online, but less than 5% of people on SNAP can afford to do so.\n\nSNAP benefits average only about $1.40 per person per meal. Food insecurity experts have long said SNAP benefits don't provide nearly enough food to support an active, healthy life.\n\nAnd the price of food has only gone up as the pandemic has kept workers at home. Americans now spend on average $184 on groceries each week, up from $159 before the outbreak. About 48% of shoppers reported paying more for items.\n\nUSDA's online grocery pilot for SNAP recipients is available only through Amazon, Walmart, Aldi and a few other retailers sprinkled across the country. That does not include smaller community stores, farmers markets or discounters where cents on the dollar usually go further. The biggest challenge is that the Agriculture Department must approve every store in each state to take payment through a PIN system, a process that can take a full year and has created a huge backlog.\n\nAs part of the $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus passed last month, Congress allotted $5 million for technical support to the USDA to expand online food programs. But no changes have been made to absorb the extra costs associated with buying food online despite the public health emergency.\n\nSNAP recipients say it's too expensive to shop online\n\nVirginia Hodge, 44, of Newark, Ohio, was laid off from her job in March. Since her unemployment benefits ran out, she has been feeding her three kids PB&J every day to stretch her $46 a week in SNAP dollars.\n\nHodge, who has Crohn's disease, a disorder that attacks the digestive system and is treated with immunosuppressants, placed an online order only once after a flare-up that landed her at the hospital for 17 days. Hodge said there is no way she could pay $20 in tip and delivery every week when she's struggling to keep power, water and heat on in the dead of winter.\n\n\"That's $80,\" said Hodge of a month's worth of delivery fees. \"That's my water bill.\"\n\nHodge said her doctor won't let her go back to work until she is vaccinated against the virus, which in Ohio might not be until the summer. If food shopping online was more affordable, she said, she wouldn't shop in a panic week after week, trying to avoid crowds or coming in contact with someone who isn't wearing a mask properly.\n\nSNAP recipients purchasing food online can spend more than a third of their total benefits – anywhere from $45 to $98 – on one purchase because of higher food costs and limited inventory, according to exclusive data shared with USA TODAY obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests by unBox, a student-led organization based in California working to address food insecurity and policy.\n\nOnline shopping with food stamps peaked in June right before states began reopening from COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, in some cases up to 19% in states like Kentucky, then stagnated because of the many barriers to access, researchers said.\n\nBut researchers said there is very little data on who is using food stamps to buy food online.\n\nThe lack of data has made it hard for policymakers and administrators to know how to allocate resources and make sure the USDA's pilot is successful, said Charlie Hoffs, unBox's co-founder.\n\nRetailers provide limited options for SNAP clients\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, Chris Rogers, vice president of retail at Instacart, declined to share how many SNAP users use the platform but said that “the program has exceeded our expectations.”\n\nRogers said the company acknowledges how delivery and pickup fees could be difficult for the country’s most economically vulnerable families. In hopes to help subsidize costs for SNAP beneficiaries, Instacart started waiving delivery fees in December for the \"first three EBT orders for each customer with a valid EBT card associated with their account\" until March 16.\n\nAt the moment, Instacart allows customers paying with food stamps to purchase food only at Aldi. Rogers said Instacart has lobbied the USDA to approve more retailers on the app.\n\nWith Amazon, SNAP beneficiaries customers can access more than 100,000 items and get free shipping on orders over $25. SNAP beneficiaries also have complimentary access to Amazon Fresh with free shipping on orders over $35 in most states.\n\nBut many SNAP users live in low-income neighborhoods that are outside these delivery zones.\n\nThat's the case for Jackie Klade, 36, of Wasau, Wisconsin, who can't find a store to deliver groceries free in her hometown.\n\nKlade is the mother of 11-year-old twins with autism, one of whom had a pacemaker put in last year. Her son's doctor prescribed a strict diet of vegetables and legumes to treat his pediatric heart disease.\n\n\"I can't feed my kids pasta or cans of Spaghettios,\" she said.\n\nBefore the pandemic, she worked part-time at a kitchen and was receiving $37 a month in SNAP benefits. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, extended the maximum amount to households in October, upping her allotment to about $450 a month.\n\nWithout the emergency SNAP allotment, Klade said, \"it would be back to the food pantry for us.\"\n\nSome lawmakers have made it their priority to improve healthy food options for SNAP recipients. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, proposed legislation in July that would create an online portal and app that would allow more discounters, smaller retailers and farmers to sell online to Americans paying with SNAP benefits.\n\n\"This important step will help millions of people safely put food on the table, especially in rural areas and from smaller community retailers,” Durbin said.\n\nIn Texas, Wilt said the past few months have taken a toll, especially after her home health aide quit in March. Unable to work or send the children back to school, she has had to manage both kids' education and medical care virtually.\n\nHer youngest, Rosie, is one of 26 known people in the world – and the only one in Texas – with a rare mutation of the USP7 gene that impedes normal bodily functions. As a result, she's nonverbal and has physical and developmental challenges that make her extremely high-risk for COVID-19.\n\nWilt said she's waiting for the government to look out for families like hers, who are counting dollars every month to feed their children while trying to avoid a deadly plague.\n\n\"They have us on a ball and chain,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/24"}]}

Two years, later ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden took office just over two years ago pledging to reverse the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration, including rebuilding a refugee program that had shrunk to a historic low.\n\nHe pledged in May 2021 to \"take this action\" for the refugees around the world \"who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin\" raising the annual cap for refugees allowed into the country to 62,500. He doubled it for the following year to 125,000 – up from former President Donald Trump's 15,000 low point.\n\nBiden said the Trump era \"did not reflect America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees.\"\n\nBut a USA TODAY analysis shows that the United States admitted only 20% of the number Biden envisioned – almost 26,000, leaving tens of thousands of unfilled slots for people fleeing perilous conditions such as wars and natural disasters.\n\nThe number of refugees the Biden Administration has accepted in fiscal 2022 was on par with the Trump years. Refugee experts and advocates say it will likely take years for the administration to be on track to meet their goals leaving thousands of people in danger waiting in line, whose last remaining hope is safe haven in the U.S.\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis of the United States Refugee Admissions Program does not include figures for refugees admitted through special programs designed to quickly admit refugees, such as those created for Afghan and Ukrainian refugees. Migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border are also not included in the number.\n\nOther findings of the USA TODAY analysis include:\n\nThe number of refugee arrivals to the United States more than doubled between fiscal years 2021 and 2022, but the number remained below pre-pandemic years.\n\nAcross the 23 years, the highest ceilings for a region in a fiscal year were Africa in 2022 and 2023, and the Near East/South Asia in 2017. Those regions also have the highest average caps and admissions, while Latin America/Caribbean' and the region that includes Europe and Central Asia had the lowest averages.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo was the top nation of origin for refugees admitted to the U.S. for the sixth year in a row.\n\nThe number of refugees admitted from Guatemala increased by more than five times from 2021.\n\nThe administration has \"been pretty clear that they're not necessarily expecting to reach 125,000 for this fiscal year, that it's a lofty goal,” said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “There's been two years of rebuilding now, and I think our domestic capacity has grown to absorb larger refugee numbers.”\n\nIn response to questions from USA TODAY, the State Department spokesperson denied low refugee admission numbers mean the administration hasn't made progress in restoring the program.\n\n“Refugee admissions, of course, are a lagging indicator of our progress; it’ll take a little more time to feel the impact,” the spokesperson said, adding that refugee interviews are returning to levels seen before the Trump administration.\n\nRefugee admissions doubled from fiscal year 2021 to 2022\n\nGutted refugee system\n\nPast administrations have not always met their quotas for admitting refugees into the United States.\n\nHowever, in the last full year of former President Barack Obama's term, his administration was just shy of meeting its 85,000 admissions limit.\n\nBut after Trump came into office, he paused refugee admissions. In his last years in office, Trump set the limit to historically low admissions: 18,000 for fiscal year 2020 and 15,000 for fiscal year 2021. The government didn't even meet those ceilings.\n\nThe Trump administration gutted many refugee resettlement agencies that the United States government relies on to connect refugees with housing, jobs, and benefits and enroll their children in school.\n\nBiden raised the fiscal year 2021 limit months after he became president.\n\nBy then, the damage had been done.\n\nGelatt said the low numbers of refugees under Trump had a “carryover impact into this administration.”\n\n“That resettlement network was really decimated in a way under the Trump administration because there were so few refugees coming,” she said. “There was less funding for the refugee resettlement, there was less need for staff and for offices, so offices were closing.”\n\nThe State Department has said it is in the process of rebuilding and enhancing its refugee admissions program. Their target goal is to sustain an average of 10,000 to 11,000 admissions per month.\n\nBut there is still more that needs to be done to address long refugee process times.\n\nKathleen Arnold, director of Refugee and Forced Migration Studies at DePaul University, said the United States has one of the highest vetting processes in the world. The process could take years and there isn't a guarantee that a refugee will be accepted.\n\n\"It's almost impossible even with people with really good cases to get refugee status,\" she said.\n\nWhat is the refugee cap 2023?\n\nHumanitarian crises in Afghanistan and Ukraine\n\nThe administration faced with two humanitarian crises over the past two years that caused an unexpected influx of refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the pullout of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, the inpouring of refugees forced the administration to develop special \"humanitarian parole\" programs to mitigate the global emergency. These programs allowed refugees to be quickly admitted into the United States.\n\nThe crises relied on the same refugee resettlement agencies that typically work with refugees accepted through the United States Refugee Admissions Program.\n\nThose agencies had to split focus on individuals admitted through special programs that were designed to quickly admit refugees into the United States.\n\nThe number of refugees who were allowed into the United States under these programs is not included in the overall numbers of refugee admissions in the USA TODAY analysis. Roughly 84,000 Afghan refugees were admitted through the special resettlement program.\n\nGelatt noted the administration and many local refugee service providers prioritized welcoming refugees who were entering the United States under the government's \"humanitarian parole\" program.\n\n“In many cases, those were the same people who would have been serving refugees instead they were serving parolees,” Gelatt said. “It was a big challenge because Afghans all showed up at once, so it was a big challenge to resettle them. And then there's strong demand from Ukrainians who are coming for resettlement services.”\n\nElizabeth Foydel, private sponsorship program director for International Refugee Assistance Project, said that while there are financial resources to help both parolees and refugees, there isn’t “the architecture to harness them.”\n\n“It can be very challenging to have so many competing priorities at a time when you are still trying to rebuild, still trying to staff up, still trying to refine your internal protocols and procedures,” Foydel said. “That certainly has been a challenge for I think everyone involved in this space.\n\nPrivate refugee sponsorship program\n\nAs part of its efforts to admit more refugees into the country, the Biden administration announced a new private refugee sponsorship program in January.\n\nThe program allows Americans to be partnered with refugees to help them find housing and jobs and get them settled into their new communities. The program in theory takes some of the pressure off of resettlement agencies and puts it in the hands of the American people, with some assistance from the government and refugee agencies.\n\nInternational Refugee Assistance Project, a refugee advocacy organization, is one of the partners with the U.S. government for this program.\n\n“We want to really see the U.S. live up to a narrative it often uses about being kind of a nation of immigrants … and really say that and see that play out on a local level,” Foydel said. “And also give ordinary Americans the opportunity to step up and do something very, very tangible and meaningful.”\n\nThe State Department has a goal to resettle at least 5,000 refugees through the program.\n\nWhile Foydel said she wants to see some improvements from the U.S. government on processing times for refugees, she said she believes that more refugees will be admitted in the coming year.\n\n“Sometimes things go more slowly than we would like, but I do think that we are on track to see increased refugee admissions and that hopefully, it's a steady rate of increase,” she said.\n\nWhat are the refugee caps for each region of the world?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/08/09/syria-refugees-united-states-women-children/88446226/", "title": "Most Syrian refugees coming to U.S. are women, children", "text": "Jared Goyette\n\nGlobalPost\n\nIn a November interview with Fox News, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had a question about the United States' effort to accept Syrian refugees.\n\n“It’s a total disaster. The people are going to come in,” he told commentator Sean Hannity. “I talked to you about this two weeks ago, where we talked about the migration, how so many of the people in the migration were strong young men. You look at them. I’m saying, Where are the women? Where are the children?”\n\nNow, as it appears the U.S. will meet President Obama’s goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, the makeup of this new refugee population is becoming more clear.\n\nOf the more than 8,000 Syrian refugees admitted to the country so far, 78% are women or children, according figures released by the State Department this month. Fifty-eight percent are children, with a roughly even split between girls and boys.\n\nOnly a few months ago, refugee activists and experts were concerned that the US would not admit many of the almost 5 million Syrian refugees who have fled the country since civil war began there over five years ago. By April 2016, halfway through the fiscal year, only 1,285 people had been admitted. However, monthly totals have increased steadily, with over 2,000 arriving in July. The uptick came as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies working in tandem on the project expanded their capacity.\n\n“We can now say that we’ve welcomed 8,000 Syrian refugees so far this year, and that we are very confident that we will welcome at least 10,000 refugees from Syria by the end of this fiscal year,” said Anne Richard, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, in a conference call Friday with reporters.\n\nRichards said DHS had ramped up its staffing to interview and vet refugees in several key locations, including Jordan, where officers conducted interviews for about 12,000 applicants who had been initially screened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThe State Department also restarted interviews of UNHCR-screened refugees in Beirut, Lebanon in February, and began processing cases in Erbil, Iraq in December.\n\n“Our expectation from the beginning was that the rate of Syrian refugee admissions would increase over time as referrals from the UNHCR increased, as we added to capacity,” Richards said.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director León Rodriguez emphasized that the increase in admittances did not mean that refugees were going through a less-rigorous screening process.\n\nAccording to figures posted on the White House website, less than 1 percent of refugees make it through an initial UNHCR screening. They are then vetted by the US intelligence community — the FBI, DHS and State Department — in a process that can take up to two years.\n\nThe vetting process includes multiple interviews and database checks. Rodriguez said the officers who conduct the interviews undergo extensive training about legal definitions, country conditions, and interview techniques to detect credibility issues or security concerns. Syrian refugees go through an additional level of screening, which includes a more in-depth review of applicants’ histories, including their past social media postings. That screening occurs before the initial interview is conducted and can yield specific lines of questioning for each candidate.\n\n“The interviews conducted by those officers are frequently extensive, probe credibility issues and probe particular bases of inadmissibility,” Rodriguez said.\n\nEach applicant is also subject to cross-agency database checks, which can determine if they have been flagged by the FBI, the CIA or Department of Defense. The database checks occur before, during and after the application process.\n\n“I believe this information is very critical because it really rebuts what is a widely held view that we do not have resources against which to vet these individuals,” Rodriguez said. “In fact, hundreds of individuals from different countries, including hundreds of individuals from Syria, have had their admission to the United States denied because of the information that was found in these databases.”\n\nRichards said the U.S. should maintain its current pace of accepting Syrian refugees for the rest of the fiscal year, \"so we may exceed 10,000.\"\n\n\"For next year, we will continue to welcome large numbers of Syrians, but it’s too soon to have a target figure established,” she said.\n\nThe U.S. government has also also set up a process to promote family reunification for Iraqi and Syrian refugees who have relatives in the country. The program, called “Priority 2” or P-2, allows refugee applicants with relatives in the U.S. to bypass the UNHCR screening. U.S.-based family members can start an application on behalf of their relatives abroad via an I-130 petition for reunification. If that request is approved, family members then go through the same screening by U.S. agencies as all other refugee applicants.\n\nAccording to a State Department spokesperson, over 2,000 Syrians have been accepted for consideration via the I-130 program and are at various stages of processing. Only 20 individuals have been approved so far. None of them have arrived in the U.S. yet.\n\nWhile the U.S. is now set to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, the total pales in comparison to the numbers accepted by other countries. Canada resettled 25,000 Syrian refugees between November and February, according to government figures. Germany received more than 300,000 asylum petitions since 2011, while Sweden has taken more than 100,000 in the same time period, according to the UNHCR.\n\nAnd U.N. figures show that the biggest burden has been carried by Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Jordan has taken in more than 650,000 refugees and Lebanon has absorbed over 1 million. Turkey hosts more than 2.7 million Syrian refugees, more than any other country.\n\nThe U.S. has accepted more refugees in the past. In 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the US admitted 125,000 Vietnamese refugees.\n\nThis story was first published on PRI.org.

Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal enclaves to protest what they say are inadequate federal efforts on southern border security.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard had not been expecting the group, and DeSantis’ move was sharply denounced by the White House, migrants’ advocates and Democratic officials.\n\nAt a church where they had been staying on Martha’s Vineyard, migrants cheered Friday morning when they heard the Massachusetts government would shelter them at the Cape Cod military base. They boarded government-arranged buses willingly, officials said, and they arrived at the military installation Friday afternoon.\n\nJoint Base Cape Cod – already an emergency shelter designated by the state emergency management agency – is set up to provide “a safe temporary accommodation appropriate for the needs of families and individuals,” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s office said in a news release.\n\nThe migrants “will be housed in dormitory-style spaces at JBCC, with separate spaces accommodating both individuals and families,” and families will not be separated, it said. They will have access to services including legal, health care, food, hygiene kits, and crisis counseling, according to Baker’s office.\n\nAt the base, some of the migrants from Venezuela received general information about US immigration laws, according to a migrant who spoke to CNN. At this time, CNN is unable to verify what exactly was shared or from whom due to lack of access.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of civil rights attorneys working with the migrants said their stories are “heartbreaking – and infuriating.” Many of the migrants went to a hospital in need of care upon their arrival at the island Wednesday.\n\nSome of these migrants were sent to Martha’s Vineyard even though they have immigration hearings scheduled nowhere near Massachusetts, the group said. Migrants released from government custody often move to other cities in the US as they go through their immigration proceedings.\n\n“This cowardly political stunt has placed our clients in peril,” the Lawyers for Civil Rights group said in a news release Friday. “Some now have immigration hearings as early as Monday thousands of miles away.”\n\nSome attorneys from the group accompanied the migrants on the buses to the Cape Cod base.\n\nCNN has reached out to Baker’s office and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency for comment, as they are coordinating efforts to care for the migrants at the base.\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard board buses Friday that took them to a military base on Cape Cod. CNN\n\nFlights came from Texas, though Florida governor says he arranged them\n\nThough Florida’s governor says he arranged for the flights, the migrants had been in Texas – not Florida.\n\nWednesday’s flights originated in San Antonio, Texas, according to the director of Martha Vineyard’s airport, Geoffrey Freeman.\n\nFor months, DeSantis has been talking about his plans to get Florida involved in redirecting migrants from the southern border in a way to maximize heartburn for Democratic leaders. And last month, DeSantis telegraphed Florida might help move migrants from the US-Mexico border – not from his state.\n\n“We do have money to be able to do (that), but that’s from people from the southern border, that’s not going in the interior of Florida,” DeSantis said at an August press conference.\n\nHis administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation, and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to liberal strongholds.\n\nWhen he laid out his immigration plans at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha’s Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, “It’s somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it is true, if you sent (them) to Delaware or Martha’s Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.”\n\nMigrants on Martha's Vineyard boarded three buses Friday headed for Joint Base Cape Cod. CNN\n\nIn a Friday news conference in Daytona Beach, DeSantis said he intends to use “every penny” of the $12 million and set the expectation for more buses and “likely more” flights with migrants paid for by Florida.\n\n“These are just the beginning efforts,” he said. The governor defended using taxpayer dollars to send the migrants to Martha’s Vineyard because he said many of the people who cross the border end up in his state.\n\nState budget records show six days before the migrants were flown to Massachusetts, Florida’s Department of Transportation paid $615,000 to Destin, Florida-based aviation company Vertol Systems as part of the governor’s program to relocate migrants.\n\nBudget records do not detail what kind of “contracted services” Vertol provided the department, nor is it clear whether the $615,000 was for two flights to Martha’s Vineyard. Additional budget records obtained by CNN also show the state first requested the payment on September 7.\n\nCNN reached out to Vertol Systems, the Department of Transportation and DeSantis’ office but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nA Venezuelan migrant is led onto a bus Friday in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard.

They were dropped on the island without notice to anyone in the community,” the news release reads.\n\nIn his Friday news conference, Florida’s governor disputed the migrants did not know where they were going, because he said they had signed a waiver and had been provided with a packet including a map of Martha’s Vineyard adding, “It’s obvious that’s where they were going,” and it was all “voluntary.”\n\nTwo of the migrants told CNN, while they were in San Antonio, they decided to go on the trip after two women and a man approached them on the streets near a migrant resource center.\n\nOne of the migrants, Wilmer Villazana, said he was put up in a hotel for five days before the flights and was well taken care of. The women told him they were from Orlando and worked for private organizations that raise funds to help migrants, Villazana said.\n\nOne of the women told Villazana and the other migrant, Yang Pablo Mora, they would get help with shelter and jobs once they arrived at their destination, Villazana and Mora said.\n\nVillazana and Mora did not know the flights were headed to Martha’s Vineyard, they said. Villazana thought they were going to Boston, he said.\n\nWhite House denounces DeSantis’ move\n\nDeSantis’ decision to arrange the migrants’ flight to Massachusetts was one of two high-profile transports sent north by southern Republican governors this week. On Thursday, two buses of migrants sent from Texas by Gov. Greg Abbott arrived outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence in the nation’s capital.\n\nTexas started busing migrants to Washington this spring. Arizona’s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey followed suit, and the two states have since sent thousands of migrants to Washington. Abbott has expanded Texas’ effort to include New York City and Chicago.\n\nThe White House on Thursday denounced this week’s moves by DeSantis and Abbott. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused the governors of using migrants as “political pawns” and said their actions amounted to a “cruel, premeditated political stunt.”\n\nUS Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins will speak with members of the Department of Justice about DeSantis sending the migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, though she did not yet have enough information to say whether he broke any laws in doing so, she told reporters on Thursday.\n\nDespite Wednesday’s unannounced arrivals on Martha’s Vineyard, some residents of the island worked quickly to provide some key services. The island is known for being a summer haven for the affluent.\n\n“Our island jumped into action putting together 50 beds, giving everyone a good meal, providing a play area for the children, making sure people have the healthcare and support they need,” Massachusetts state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, a Democrat who represents the island, wrote on Twitter. “We are a community that comes together to support immigrants.”", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Kristina Sgueglia Miguel Marquez Carolyn Sung", "Jason Hanna", "Kristina Sgueglia", "Miguel Marquez", "Carolyn Sung"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/us/migrant-asylum-immigration-backlog/index.html", "title": "Over 580,000 migrants have entered the backlogged US ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA 4-year-old girl wipes her mother’s tears inside a migrant respite center in El Paso, Texas.

It hurts my soul,” Castro says, crying. Little Camila looks at her mom with a sense of worry as Castro shares the horrific story.\n\nCastro believes she was likely spared from rape on their journey because she had Camila with her. She says those are the risks women take to flee “dictatorship and much poverty” in her home country, where people have no “freedom of expression.”\n\nThe Castros were among the more than 580,000 migrants who were apprehended at the US southern border by Border Patrol, processed and released by immigration authorities into the United States this fiscal year pending immigration proceedings, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn August alone, immigration agents encountered more than 203,000 individuals at the southern border. Migrants from just three countries – Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba – made up about 56,000 of those encounters, or about 28 percent, federal data shows.\n\nAfter an encounter at the border a migrant could be detained, immediately expelled from the US or released pending immigration proceedings.\n\nAmong the latest arrivals were the roughly 50 asylum hopefuls – mostly Venezuelans – sent from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, last month on flights organized by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – part of a series of moves by Republican governors to transport migrants to liberal areas to protest what they describe as the failure of the federal government to secure the southern border.\n\nAttorneys for the migrants have filed a class action lawsuit, saying they were misled in agreeing to the flights and had been told that they would arrive to find housing, jobs and help with the immigration process.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, DeSantis’ office repeated what was previously said: The transportation of migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard “was done on a voluntary basis.”\n\nCBP Commissioner Chris Magnus says the latest wave of migration is mostly driven by people fleeing the “failing communist regimes” in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, which is complicating the processing and removal of those individuals once they arrive in the US, as they are generally not subject to Title 42.\n\nTitle 42 is the pandemic public health order that since 2020 has allowed immigration authorities to swiftly expel some migrants to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nRising levels of repression, food shortages and economic stability are motivating Venezuelans and Nicaraguans to flee their homelands said Doris Meissner, who directs US immigration policy work at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “These populations … require different kinds of response,” Meissner told CNN recently. “We have not established an asylum system that is in any way up to the level of the challenge that this change brought about.”\n\n‘I don’t think this is sustainable long term’\n\nEl Paso's US Border Patrol sector erected this open-air triage processing center after immigration agents realized that the spike in migration was not an anomaly. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nIn Del Rio, Texas, a small border town of about 35,000 residents, border patrol vans and buses constantly drop off migrants who have been processed by immigration agents at the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition – the one migrant respite center in town. So far this year, more than 32,000 migrants have come through the center, a nearly 40% increase over last year’s total, according to Tiffany Burrow, the center’s director of operations.\n\n“It’s just been so consistently growing that we’ve been able to adapt. But I don’t think this is sustainable long term,” Burrow told CNN.\n\nEl Paso, which is about 400 miles northwest of Del Rio, opened its own migrant respite center last month after shelters there reached maximum capacity and people started pitching tents on the street.\n\nThat’s where CNN first met Yensel Castro and her daughter, in the children’s play area of the center.\n\nCastro’s voice broke and her eyes flooded with tears as soon as she started talking about her mother waiting for her in Chicago.\n\n“I miss her so much,” she said between sobs, explaining that she had no money to travel to Chicago, where her mom was waiting for her. She said her mother left Nicaragua for Chicago five months ago and had been working to rent a home for the three of them.\n\nA short drive from the respite center, El Paso’s Border Patrol Sector recently erected an open-air triage-style processing center under a highway overpass to help process migrants faster.\n\nCNN got access to the center, which includes sections for intake, medical care and a waiting area, last month. Buses equipped with processing technology were parked on-site. Migrants don’t stay there very long, a few hours at the most. They are swiftly processed and divided into two groups, those who will be expelled to Mexico under Title 42 and those who are allowed to stay, pending their immigration proceedings.\n\n“It’s like a mobile command center,” Magnus told CNN during an interview on-site. Magnus explained that people are given the opportunity to seek asylum, they are being vetted, and criminal backgrounds are being checked.\n\nFar from the border, other Texas cities are responding to the crisis. San Antonio recently opened a respite center and another one is in the planning stages in Houston. Chicago, New York and Washington, DC have been forced to respond after several Republican governors transported migrants in buses to their cities unannounced.\n\nAmerica’s backlogged immigration system\n\nA child sleeps at the El Paso airport after his family's one month journey from Venezuela. According to the child's father, the family is seeking asylum in the United States. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nThe recently arrived migrants and asylum seekers are entering a highly complicated and backlogged immigration system. This fiscal year alone, U.S. immigration Courts recorded over 819,000 new immigration cases.\n\nAt the end of August, there were nearly 2 million immigration cases pending in immigration courts. That total includes 743,250 cases in which asylum claims have been made and are still pending, according to an analysis of government data by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. There are hundreds of thousands more asylum cases going through US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the USCIS ombudsman told the National Law Review in July.\n\n“It can take many years for the government to even call them [asylum seekers] for an interview or to go to court,” says Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), a non-profit organization with more than 400,000 asylum seeker members from 175 countries.\n\nIn late May, the Biden administration launched an effort to speed up some types of asylum claims. The rule authorizes asylum officers – and not just immigration court judges – to consider asylum claims for those who assert a fear of persecution and pass the credible fear screening.\n\nThe effort, which is being implemented in a phased manner, is expected to shorten the process of some asylum applications, from several years on average to several months, according to the DHS.\n\nBut while that program rolls out, frustration over asylum application delays is compounded by another layer of the process. Individuals going through the asylum process have to apply separately for the right to work legally.\n\nCruz says asylum seekers are eligible to apply for a work permit 150 days after they file for asylum and, under the law, the federal government has 30 days to process applications.\n\nAt the end of March about 443,000 work permit cases were pending, according to a USCIS spokesperson.\n\nThat month USCIS established new goals to reduce the agency’s pending caseload, the spokesperson said.\n\nASAP and various other non-profit groups are in an ongoing legal battle with the federal government over work permit delays for asylum seekers. Cruz and her legal team are asking a judge to order USCIS to process its members’ work permit applications in 30 days, as the law requires.\n\n“The government should comply, and process asylum seekers’ work permits as quickly as possible whether they’re forced to by a federal judge and a court order or not,” Cruz said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, USCIS said the agency does not comment on issues directly related to pending litigation; but the agency acknowledged the “historic volumes of employment authorization requests” and noted its efforts to curb delays.\n\n“USCIS set new agency-wide backlog reduction goals, expanded premium processing to additional form types, and implemented efforts to improve timely access to employment authorization documents. The agency remains committed to upholding America’s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve,” a spokesperson told CNN by email.\n\nThe faces of America’s new asylum seekers\n\nCNN has met dozens of migrants and asylum hopefuls in respite centers and shelters along the US southern border in the past few months. It’s at these centers that migrants get the opportunity to charge their cellphones, contact family to let them know they’ve been processed by immigration authorities and released into the United States, and where they take buses and planes to the interior of the country.\n\nIsmael Martinez says he's renting a room in New York for $1,000 per month.

Castro says she's now \"in a very complicated situation.\" Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nFor Yensel Castro, the migrant who said she witnessed the rape on her journey to the US with her child, reuniting with her mother in Chicago has been a rollercoaster of emotion. She was able to catch a bus, provided by the City of El Paso, the day she spoke with CNN. But the reunion was not what she expected. Castro says she was surprised to learn that her mom was very sick with arthritis and can no longer work.\n\n“I’m in a very complicated situation,” Castro says.\n\nCastro says she was processed by immigration authorities and released into the country last month. But she still has to go through her immigration proceedings, file an asylum application and get a work permit. And she is responsible for taking care of both her ailing parent and Camila.\n\n“I thought it would be easy, that upon arriving I’d be working the next day,” Castro said. “I’m starting from zero and it’s very tough.”\n\nCastro says she’s so desperate for help that when a woman she met at the grocery store offered her a bag of hand-me-down clothes for Camila, she walked for two hours, one hour each way, to get the items.\n\nOnce home, Castro showed her daughter each piece of clothing one by one. She took video of the moment and shared it with CNN.\n\nCamila’s face lit up with excitement when her mom pulled out a long-sleeved shirt with a Christmas tree surrounded by presents and a puppy.\n\n“Do you like it?” Castro asked.\n\n“Yes,” Camila said. “It fits me.”\n\nIn the video, Camila holds up the shirt basking in joy that seemed unimaginable just a few days earlier at the migrant respite center – where her journey in the US began.", "authors": ["Rosa Flores"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/03/refugee-admissions-u-s-plummet-2017/999903001/", "title": "Refugee admissions to U.S. plummet in 2017", "text": "President Trump had to battle the courts and vocal opposition, but by the end of the year, he was able to slash refugee admissions into the United States to historic lows.\n\nFrom Inauguration Day to Dec. 31, his administration accepted 29,022 refugees, the lowest number since at least 2002, according to State Department data. Comparable figures before then are not available.\n\nThe previous low during that time frame (29,468) came in 2002, when the U.S. slowed down all avenues of legal immigration following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThat decline will continue in 2018 because Trump instituted an annual cap of 45,000 refugees a year, the lowest cap since Congress created the Refugee Resettlement Program in 1980. Presidents have the authority to unilaterally set the annual refugee cap, which has been as high as 217,000 under President Reagan and hovered between 70,000 and 80,000 under the Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nFor some, Trump's drastic reduction represents a campaign promise fulfilled.\n\n\"Elections have consequences,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration. \"This is what he said he's going to do, and he's doing it.\"\n\nOpponents of the president say the numbers represent a loss not only for would-be refugees, but also for America's economy and its standing in the world.\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which has advocated for a higher refugee cap, said many Midwestern cities depend on refugees to work in the meat-packing and poultry plants that sustain their struggling economies.\n\nAs more migrants are fleeing their homelands, Noorani said now is the worst possible time for the U.S. to retreat from its historic role as a \"moral beacon\" for the oppressed.\n\n\"There are ways to help refugees get to places of safety and begin a new life that serves the American interest,\" Noorani said. \"Past administrations have been able to do that.

After being initially blocked by federal judges, the Trump administration was able to halt the refugee program for several months to review the system.\n\nIn October, Trump signed an executive order that restarted the refugee program, but it included new restrictions that severely limited the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. Most notably, it barred citizens of 11 countries — identified by refugee agencies as Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nRefugees from those countries accounted for 44% of admissions to the U.S. in the 2017 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/25/syria-refugees-security-obama-trump-alternative-column/76326168/", "title": "Kirsten Powers: A third way for helping refugees", "text": "Kirsten Powers\n\nSyrian refugees trying to escape the monstrous evil of ISIS have become the latest casualty in America’s toxic political debate.\n\nDonald Trump indicated support for a database to track Syrian refugees that enter the country, and Ben Carson unhelpfully invoked rabid dogs in attempting to explain his opposition to opening our doors to desperate asylum seekers.\n\nMeanwhile, too many supporters of accepting the refugees are dismissing the fear that terrorists might slip in with them as nothing more than rank xenophobia.

Even fewer have gained asylum in the United States. According to the Department of Homeland Security, only 3.2% of those granted asylum by the U.S. were Syrians in 2013, at 811 people. A New York Times analysis found that 1,854 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the U.S. since 2012.\n\nWhile some critics complain that Middle Eastern countries aren’t doing enough to address the refugee crisis, almost a fifth of Lebanon’s population is comprised of Syrian refugees and Turkey has accepted more than 2 million. Jordan has more than 600,000, Iraq 200,000 plus, and roughly 130,000 Syrian refugees have settled in Egypt. In Lebanon, World Vision staff report that many Syrian refugees are holding on to their house keys because they still hope to go home.\n\nEven if the U.S. admitted the 10,000 Syrian refugees the Obama Administration has promised, it would remain an infinitesimal portion of the more than 4.2 million Syrian refugees registered with the U.N. Still, in a new Fox News poll, 67% of voters — including nearly half of Democrats — oppose admitting the refugees. At the same time, a recent Ipsos survey commissioned by World Vision found that 71% of Americans said they would be willing to help Syrian refugees.\n\nGlenn Reynolds: Obama's Syrian refugee debacle\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nSo perhaps there is a third way here.\n\nThe U.N. World Food Program (WFP) remains underfunded, which has forced them to reduce the level of food assistance to those affected by the Syrian war to 50 cents a day. They immediately require $142 million to continue serving the refugees through the end of the year. This should be a no-brainer for Congress and the president.\n\nWorld Vision has recommended Congress move quickly to fund critical humanitarian relief accounts including Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance which would cost about $5 billion for 2016. These programs provide aid globally, not just in Syria. (For some perspective the U.S. spends roughly $100 billion a year on corporate subsidies).\n\nThe WFP has reported that many of the refugees are seeking new places to live precisely because they can’t survive where they are. So, if Americans don’t want them in the U.S., the best thing to do is help them stay where they are.

Located off the coast of Massachusetts, the island of Martha’s Vineyard – home to Edgartown and several other municipalities – is known as a posh summer destination for wealthy vacationers.\n\nWhile the town’s winter population is a couple hundred people, it jumps up to several thousand during the hotter months when they welcome summer tourists, Hagerty said.\n\nAn estimated year-round island population of around 20,000 can balloon to more than 100,000 during peak tourism season.\n\nBut the challenge with this week’s arrival of migrants was they were unexpected, the town administrator said, and it all happened so “last minute” and the migrants’ needs were so diverse and included relocation and transportation costs for those who were looking to go to another part of the country.\n\nIn addition to the donations, the towns on the island as well as community-based and nonprofit groups helped in the effort to care for the migrants and offer them shelter, food and care, according to a Facebook post from the Dukes County government.\n\n“We are grateful to the many local and neighboring community members who have reached out with offers of support,” county officials wrote in the post.\n\nResidents from across the island and other parts of the country raised more than $175,000 after the migrants’ arrival, according to Beth Folcarelli, CEO of the nonprofit Martha’s Vineyard Community Services. And while there were some large donations consisting of multiple thousands of dollars, most of the donations made for the migrants were contributions between $50 to $100, Folcarelli said.\n\n“In just two days we built such a connection between the volunteers who worked at the shelter and really providing and working with the migrants to really take some next steps for their future in this country,” she said.\n\nOn Friday, the migrants were transported to a military base to receive shelter and humanitarian support, officials said.\n\nBefore they left, all those who needed a cell phone were provided a mobile device with a US-based number, and they were all given a $50 Visa card, with the help of funds raised by the community, Folcarelli said.\n\n“We did come together, and I think were able to organize really in a very short time, get things going for them,” she added. “People stepped forward right away.”\n\nThe unexpected arrival is the latest move in a series of actions by Republican governors to transport migrants to northern liberal cities and states in order to protest the Biden administration’s policies at the southern border.\n\nAlso this week, Texas Gov.

But her welcoming stance has come under increasing assault from an anti-immigration party that has shown surprising strength in local elections this year.\n\nA backlash against the flood of refugees flared a year ago, when gangs of recent arrivals were accused of mass sexual assaults of women during New Year's eve celebrations in Cologne and other cities. Since then, there have been other attacks by migrants that have put Merkel under pressure to reverse her refugee policy.\n\nAmri, 24, the suspect in Monday's truck attack at Berlin's Breitscheidplatz, which killed 12 and injured 48, spent time in jail for theft and vandalism. His German asylum application was rejected because authorities feared he had become radicalized.

There have been more than 1,000 incidents, dozens of them violent, targeting refugee shelters and asylum seekers in Germany since the start of this year, according to the interior ministry.\n\nOdeh Diab, 20, a Syrian refugee, said that in Berlin, the vast majority of his interactions with Germans have been positive and helpful but a backlash is noticeable in small ways. \"Often when I get on the subway and sit down, people immediately move away from me because they think I am dangerous,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that there was a far-right, anti-immigration demonstration at the site of the Christmas market attack on Wednesday night, but a simultaneous counter-protest was far larger.\n\n\"The idea of a huge 'backlash' against the refugees is being pushed by the right-wing political agenda of some of political parties and groups,\" said Gregor Wendler, a Berliner with a government-funded organization that helps refugees find work in Germany's capital. \"That only works on people who don't know how they feel about refugees.\"\n\nAbout two-thirds of Germans approve of Merkel's decision to stand for a fourth term in next year's general election, according to a poll published in late November — before the attack — by PoliBarometer.\n\nStill, an earlier survey published by Germany's Focus magazine found that 60% of Germans want Merkel to put a fixed limit on the number of refugees Germany accepts, a proposal she has repeatedly rebuffed. Meanwhile, the nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative für Deutschland party has seen its popularity soar in recent parliamentary elections, although it has peaked at about 15% nationwide.\n\n\"This attack is bad news for all of us refugees who live in Germany,\" said Mohammad Soltani, 25, a former bodyguard for a wealthy political family in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nLike fellow Afghan Mohebzada, Soltani sought asylum in Germany because the Taliban had made repeated threats to kill him and he saw no other option. \"A lot of my friends in Germany are very sad about this attack,\" he said. \"I hope they captured the right guy. I hope the government does not change its mind about refugees.\"\n\nMohebzada said he hopes the death of the Berlin attack suspect will allow people in Germany and throughout Europe to enjoy Christmas.\n\nLike most asylum seekers in Germany, he and his wife and two small children are Muslim. \"Wait, remind me,\" he said. \"What is the name of the guy with the big, white beard and red clothes?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/21/syrians-houston-refugees-controversy/76092688/", "title": "Syrians in Houston rebuke refugee controversy", "text": "Rick Jervis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON -- Souleman Jarrah wishes the TV newscasts would stop flashing images of Syrian refugees forging rivers or running across borders and show more of the Syrians he knows: lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs.\n\n\"Syrian people are good people, hardworking people,\" said Jarrah, 47, originally from Damascus and now a restaurant owner living in Houston. \"We've never had a problem here.\"\n\nNews that 30 state governors and members of Congress want to restrict Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. was particularly jarring in this Texan city, which resettles more Syrian refugees than any other U.S. city: 115 since 2011, according to the State Department.\n\nSyrian refugees in Florida find themselves fearful all over again\n\nThe refugee crisis is about a lot more than Syrians\n\nPresident Obama plans to bring up to 10,000 Syrian refugees into the USA over the next year. Roughly 4 million Syrians have fled the ongoing violence sparked by a civil war and terror by the group known as ISIS. The White House said 2,174 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, and \"not a single one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds.\"\n\nBut in the wake of last week's Paris terror attacks, some in Congress say even that is too much. The House on Thursday passed a bill, 289-137, to halt the admission of Syrian refugees until they undergo a more stringent vetting process. The bill still needs Senate approval, though Obama has said he would veto it.\n\nSyrians have resettled into Houston for decades. While the presence of Lebanese, Vietnamese, Korean and other ethnic groups are more succinctly felt in the scores of cafes, bakeries and restaurants throughout the city, Syrians' presence is less overt.\n\nSara Kauffman, area director at the Refugee Services of Texas in Houston, said Syrians make up a small portion of the scores of refugees that relocate to Houston each year. This past fiscal year, her office processed 185 refugees, of which 21 were Syrian, she said.\n\nTensions rise over Syrians crossing southwest U.S. border\n\nSyrian refugees are mostly families with small children and have gone through several rounds of rigorous screenings and interviews by groups such as the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Homeland Security and the State Department before reaching the U.S., Kauffman said. The vetting process often takes several years, she said.\n\n\"There's a lot of confusion about the resettlement program just because people don't know what it is,\" Kauffman said. \"There is a very formal bureaucracy with long background checks, screening and vetting process.\"\n\nThe refugees have often spent more than a year in camps in places like Turkey and Jordan before beginning the vetting process by U.S. officials, said Jim Townsend, a spokesman with Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, which helps relocate refugees. Thus, an ISIS operative hoping to enter the U.S. as a refugee could be locked in the process for several years, he said. Also, the UNHCR regularly assigns the refugee their host country, meaning there's no guarantee the applicant winds up where they want to.\n\nHouse passes bill to block Syrian refugees, require more vetting\n\nAmerica must welcome those seeking freedom: Ant�nio Guterres\n\n\"It doesn't seem the most efficient way to infiltrate other countries,\" Townsend said.\n\nAhmed Mohammad Wajak, 26, a travel and tourism student from Homs, in western Syria, fled his country four years ago when the fighting between jihadists, Syrian opposition and government forces there became too intense. He relocated to Saudi Arabia then Jordan, where he applied for refugee status. He spent more than two years shuttling between interviews with UNHCR, IOM, the State Department and Homeland Security. Finally, he was told he would be going to the U.S. He arrived in Houston last month.\n\n\"It was a surprise for me when they said, 'Do you want to go to America?'\" he said through an interpreter.\n\nWajak said he is taking intensive English classes to learn the language, then wants to find a job and later have his mom and three sisters join him in Houston. They, too, fled Syria and are living in Jordan.\n\nThe new efforts to block Syrians from coming to the USA are disheartening, he said. \"We, as Syrians, have lost so much to the terrorists,\" Wajak said, adding that several family members have been killed in the fighting. \"Unfortunately, they're judging us and putting us all in the same category.\"\n\nAmerica must welcome those seeking freedom: Ant�nio Guterres\n\nBassel Nounou, 46, arrived to Houston from Damascus in February. His Damascus import business allowed him to enter with a B1 business visa, and he's hired a lawyer to help him get his wife and kids to join him, as well. Nounou, who now works as an administrator at the El-Farouq Mosque in southwest Houston, said U.S. agents should be extra vigilant about who gets into the country, but assuming everyone from Syria is a terrorist is wrong.\n\n\"They have to investigate each one,\" Nounou said. \"But stop them? No.\"\n\nJarrah arrived in the USA in 2001 and worked for a while as a sleep disorder technician in Milwaukee. When that company folded, he pooled his savings with his two brothers and opened a restaurant in Houston. Today, he and his brothers run the Mazaj Hookah Bar and Grill, a 400-seat open-air eatery serving ethnic Syrian dishes and hookahs, a traditional Middle Eastern waterpipe.\n\nThe Paris attacks stunned and sickened him, as it did his family and friends. Denying Syrian refugees entry to the USA is a mistake, he said.\n\n\"In every country there are twisted people and there are normal people,\" Jarrah said. \"These [refugees], they suffered already and everybody in this world is trying to make them suffer more.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/21"}]}

It also comes ahead of a United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York this week, where President Joe Biden and Iranian hardline President Ebrahim Raisi will both speak.\n\nIn addition, the prisoner exchange could inject some new tensions in the U.S. presidential race. Republican presidential candidates in recent weeks have blasted the Biden administration's decision to push ahead with the prisoner exchange, arguing it amounts to paying a ransom to a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThe exchange sets free five Americans who had been accused of being spies or working on behalf of the U.S. government in Iran. The United Nations described their detentions as \"arbitrary.\" The White House has also said the allegations are false.\n\nA senior Biden administration official confirmed that two family members were also on the plane carrying the prisoners back to the United States.\n\nAs part of the deal, $6 billion in frozen Iranian oil revenues was released by the Biden administration and five Iranians charged or convicted of non-violent crimes were freed by the United States, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe White House said Biden held \"an emotional call\" with the families of the seven Americans who are returning home. Each family member who joined the call spoke with the president.\n\nDig deeper:Americans freed from Iran prison feared they had been left to 'rot Here are their stories.\n\nAmericans, Iranians: Who's being swapped for whom?\n\nThree of the American prisoners, all dual U.S.-Iran citizens, are Siamak Namazi, Emad Sharghi and Morad Tahbaz. The identities of the two other Americans have not been released. A senior Biden administration official said those two Americans wish to keep their identities private.\n\nU.S. works to free Americans in Iran:Here's what Tehran might get\n\nAlso on the plane are Namazi's mother and Tahbaz's wife, both of whom were previously unable to leave Iran.\n\nBusinessman Namazi, 51, was arrested in 2015 while visiting his family in Tehran. Sharghi, 59, was detained in 2018 a year after moving to Iran from the U.S. to work for a tech investment company. Environmentalist Tahbaz, 67, who also holds British citizenship, was arrested in 2018 while working on a conservation project in Iran.\n\nAn American is detained abroad:What happens next? Call the president?\n\nTwo of the five Iranians who were freed had been convicted of non-violent crimes while three others were awaiting trial and had not been convicted, two senior Biden administration officials said.\n\nThe five Americans were moved from prison to house arrest in an Iranian hotel in an interim step towards their release last month.\n\nThe deal emerged after months of indirect negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials. As part of the deal, the U.S. also released $6 billion in frozen Iranian oil revenues, transferred from banks in South Korea to Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that is an ally of both nations. The U.S. and Iran have no formal diplomatic relations. The funds are intended to be used for humanitarian purposes only.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday, Biden Biden celebrated the release of the Americans and thanked the governments of Qatar, Oman, Switzerland and South Korea for their role in facilitating the agreement.\n\nHere's who and what is in the deal, why it's happening now, and why the American public should take an interest.\n\n'We just know we want our brother home':Inside the secretive world of freeing American hostages abroad\n\nThe five Iranians released by the U.S. are Mehrdad Moein Ansari, Kambiz Attar Kashani, Reza Sarhangpour Kafrani, Amin Hasanzadeh and Kaveh Afrasiabi, according to Al-Monitor.\n\nThree of the Iranians did not want to go back to Iran. Iran state media said one wanted to go to a third country and two will stay in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration official also said the U.S. government will be issuing new sanctions against Iran's ministry of intelligence and its former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, which expands government tools to combat wrongful detentions. The measure was signed into law in late 2020. Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared during a visit to an Iranian island in 2007.\n\nWhat have the U.S. and Iran agreed to?\n\nThe U.S. has been freezing Iran's assets and piling on economic sanctions ever since President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in 2018. That deal was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities amid international allegations, which Iran denies, that it's seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nUnder the prisoner swap agreement announced early Monday, the U.S. has given the green light to South Korea to effectively pay Iran, through Qatar's banking system, for oil it purchased before the Trump administration imposed sanctions on these types of transactions in 2019. The White House says these funds will be held in restricted accounts in Qatar that will only allow Iran to purchase humanitarian goods such as food, medicine, medical devices and agricultural products, the administration officials said.\n\nIf Iran tries to divert the funds or use them for anything other than a limited humanitarian purposes authorized, the Biden administration \"will take action to lock up the funds,\" the official said.\n\nNone of the money comes from U.S. taxpayers, according to another senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly, and it is thus not a ransom. Oversight of how the money is used will be provided by the U.S. Treasury, Qatar and aid organizations.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY ahead of the prisoner swap, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. has been “categoric” that it will control how the funds are used. “They will be for humanitarian purposes. I have no doubt,” Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\nHowever, Iran's foreign ministry and state media have also appeared to claim that the unfrozen funds in Qatar would be under Tehran's direct and unrestricted control.\n\n\"Humanitarian means whatever the Iranian people need. So, this money will be budgeted for those needs, and the needs of the Iranian people will be decided and determined by the Iranian government,\" Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said in a recent interview with NBC News.\n\nRepublicans say the Biden administration is being naïve. Appearing on Fox Business on Sunday, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, pointed to Raisi’s comment and charged that the money would fund “terror proxy operations” and an “offensive system for a nuclear war.\"\n\nWhy is this prisoner swap happening now?\n\nAs of late August, at least 59 U.S. nationals were known to be held hostage or wrongfully detained in at least 15 countries, according to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation's annual “Bringing Americans Home” report. The foundation was started after the kidnapping and murder of an American freelance journalist.\n\nOver the last decade, several Americans detained in Iran have been released and those negotiations have followed a similar pattern in terms of conditions.\n\n'Undersecretary for thugs':Bill Richardson's endless push to free Americans detained abroad\n\nThe U.S. and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980, a consequence of the nation's Islamic Revolution and a hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\n\nIn the decades since tensions have simmered on and off.\n\nThat's not about to change.\n\nBut Henry Rome, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that the Biden administration has been viewing a prisoner swap with Tehran as a \"prerequisite to moving forward with Iran,\" including, eventually \"resuming some type of nuclear negotiation.\"\n\nU.S.-Iran pact:Trump destroyed it. Biden wants to restore it. Just don't call it a deal\n\nHe said the prisoner exchange represented a \"step in the direction of de-escalation\" and that if re-elected President Biden could seek to revive the nuclear deal with Iran and world powers in 2025.\n\nRome added that while American foreign policy attention may be absorbed with Russia and China right now, as the former wages its war in Ukraine and latter increasingly competes with the U.S. on a range of fronts, he believed that if Americans were to \"wake up to a war tomorrow it would most likely be with Iran.\"\n\nHe said this was because of the threat to U.S. forces in the Middle East by Iran-backed militias and because of the \"constant friction\" that results from U.S. attempts to ensure unimpeded travel through the Strait of Hormuz for oil tankers. Iran's navy has hijacked tankers and harassed U.S. naval ships in this area.\n\nIran claims revenge for Qasem Soleimani:U.S. Navy is still a target\n\nAn unhappy anniversary\n\n'Woman, life, liberty'Iranians on why they'll risk beatings and death for change\n\nStill, the timing of the prisoner swap may not be entirely coincidental.\n\nEbrahim Raisi, Iran’s hardline president, will be in New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, an annual event where 193 UN member states debate war, peace and everything in between.\n\nSeptember 16 also marked the one-year anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was arrested in Tehran by Iran's so-called morality police, allegedly for violating hijab rules.\n\nA year since Mahsa Amini's death:Britain, U.S. impose new sanctions on Iran\n\nAfter Amini died in police custody, some of the largest protests in Iran in years erupted. They lasted for months. They were eventually suppressed by Iran's security services in a violent crackdown.\n\n\"Iranian authorities are pushing ahead with a range of tactics aimed at breaking the resistance of women. They are bringing economic pain and suffering at a very individual level,\" said Tara Sepehri Far, a researcher at London-based think tank Chatham House, in a recent online discussion on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nBut the anger Amini's death unleashed could be waiting for a new moment to resurface.\n\n\"The prisoner release deal will be a huge relief to the long suffering families of the detained,\" Lauren Rozen, a veteran diplomatic correspondent and Iran expert wrote in her substack newsletter published on Sept. 12\n\n\"And it may do a bit to distract from gloomier headlines during Raisi’s New York visit, where he is certain to face protests, at least back home.\"\n\nInside Iran:America’s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness\n\nThe first Biden administration official, however, said there are no meetings planned or envisioned over the coming week with Iranian officials.

These individuals will soon be reunited with their families and back in the arms of their loved ones where they belong,” the President said in a statement.\n\nThe seven American detainees were released in exchange for the release of two Venezuelans imprisoned in the US for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the country, both nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores.\n\nVadell, Toledo, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, and Pereira are five of the six American oil executives known as the “CITGO 6” arrested in Venezuela more than four years ago. Two Americans who had been detained there, including one of the CITGO 6, were released in March following the visit of two top US government officials to Caracas. Heath, a Marine veteran, was detained in September 2020. Khan has been detained since January 2022. All seven individuals were classified by the US government as wrongfully detained.\n\nVadell, Toledo, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, Pereira, Heath, and Khan, a senior administration official told reporters Saturday, are in “stable health” and have been offered medical care and a “range of support options.”\n\nBiden spoke with each of the families to “share the good news of their release,” the first senior official said.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio lambasted the decision to swap the seven wrongfully detained Americans for the two Venezuelans, warning that the trade “puts Americans all over the world in danger.”\n\n“That has now put a price tag on Americans,” Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I wanted those people released as much as anybody, but every time you do this, now, others know, I can take Americans, I can hold them until I need something as a bargaining chip.”\n\n“I think seven innocent American hostages in exchange for two convicted drug dealers, who happened to be the nephews of (Venezuela President Nicolas) Maduro, is a huge win for Maduro and, unfortunately, puts Americans all over the world now in danger,” Rubio added.\n\nOn Saturday, the senior administration official described the prisoner exchange with Venezuela as a “tough” and “painful” decision for Biden and the US government.\n\n“Over the course of those negotiations, it became clear that one particular step was required to garner the only acceptable outcome: that of free Americans. The President made a tough decision, a painful decision, and offered something that the Venezuelans have actively sought. Specifically, it became clear in the course of negotiation that the release of two Venezuelans, Efraín Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, sometimes referred to as the ‘Narco nephews’ due to their relationship with Nicolas Maduro’s wife, was essential to securing the release of these Americans,” the official said.\n\nIn 2016, Flores and Campo were convicted in US federal court of conspiring to smuggle more than 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. They were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2017.\n\nBiden, the first official said, “made the difficult decision to grant clemency” to both Flores and Campo.\n\nThe President approved the swap a “number of weeks back,” and was followed by negotiation and logistical efforts that “took some time to work out,” the official said.\n\nThe released Venezuelans and Americans were both flown to “a country in between Venezuela and the United States” for the exchange. Once both planes landed, there was both virtual and visual confirmation “that the right passengers were ready to travel” and “passengers departed on different planes than the ones they came in on,” the first official said.\n\nRoger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, is with the freed Americans, the official added. Carstens’ initial impressions, the official said, were that the freed Americans were “overjoyed” to be returning to their families, declining to elaborate further on their conditions.\n\nTheir release comes months after a US government delegation quietly traveled to Venezuela in June “for discussions about the welfare and safety of US nationals in Venezuela,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN at the time.\n\nThe Zambrano family is “thrilled” that they have been freed and can now “get the much needed medical care they need” in the US, the family said in a statement.\n\n“We could not have made it this far without the advocates and other hostage families that have so generously been a light in darkness to get us to this blessed day,” the family said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the latest development and congratulated State Department personnel for “their tireless efforts to achieve this outcome.”\n\n“Although we celebrate the release of these U.S. nationals from Venezuela, we still have more work to do.

The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\n“She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home,” Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner’s wife, Cherelle. “After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that Griner’s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan’s family “have to have such mixed emotions today.”\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nGriner’s February arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the same time that the US enacted crippling sanctions in response to the Ukraine war, US diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations to try to secure the release of both Griner and Whelan.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said.\n\nThe prisoner swap occurred in Abu Dhabi Thursday, according to senior Biden administration officials. A joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nAsked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next “24 hours.” As for what he would say to Whelan’s family, he said, “We’re speaking to them.”\n\nCherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”\n\nBoth she and Brittney Griner “will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,” she added.\n\nThe Griner family echoed those sentiments in a statement Thursday night.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers - including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the family said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch President Biden give remarks after Brittney Griner release 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nWhelan told CNN in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where is being held in a remote part of Russia that he was “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far – and didn’t rule out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.”\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\n“This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,” tweeted House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable.”\n\nGriner – who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\n‘The only deal we could make right now’\n\nMonths and months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in Thursday’s prisoner swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in recent weeks that an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s release.\n\nThe final deal itself came together over the past 48 hours, the officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence.\n\nThat opening, while a significant breakthrough, was still a “painful” one, the officials said: in exchange for a convicted arms dealer, Russia would only agree to release Griner, leaving another American – Whelan – behind. In multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nBiden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official said. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brittney Griner's wife speaks about WNBA star's release 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said, because Russia said it has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.\n\nThe Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nIn the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.\n\n“It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,” the US official said.\n\nThe official says that was a “difficult decision” for Biden, but again, one he felt he had to make.\n\nGriner was moved from the penal colony to Moscow within the last 48 hours. Thursday morning, she boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates. Upon arriving there, she was met on the tarmac by US officials, including special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens. She was in “an extremely upbeat mood” and “all smiles” and “grateful.”\n\nWhelan family ‘devastated’\n\nWhelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a “sweatshop.”\n\nWhelan’s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are “devastated” that he was left behind.\n\n“It’s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, said on “CNN This Morning.” “But we do worry about what’s in Paul’s future. I think it’s become clear that the US doesn’t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I’m not really sure what the future holds.”\n\nThe Biden administration told Whelan’s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.\n\nIn an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was “devastated” at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won’t survive the rest of his sentence.\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news, according to senior administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, after the US secured the release of Trevor Reed, another American who’d been detained in Russia since 2019, Paul Whelan expressed frustration through a statement shared by his parents.\n\n“Why was I left behind?” Whelan said in April. “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in Russia 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of Death’ included in swap\n\nBout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nIt was a US decision to have the exchange happen in Abu Dhabi, an official familiar with the discussion said. “Russia was happy with it,” then UAE facilitated and provided the venue.\n\nWhen Putin and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, met in Russia in October, one of the issues they discussed was prisoner exchanges, and there was an agreement that the UAE could be helpful on the topic, a senior UAE official told CNN.\n\nThe US was aware that MBZ planned to raise the topic with Putin and there was nothing but encouragement from the US side, the official said.\n\n“There was criticism of the Putin meeting at the time. But that meeting is part of the reason that Griner was released today,” the official said.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Biden thanked the United Arab Emirates for its help with the exchange.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap. The statement said that the “success of the mediation efforts is a reflection of the mutual and solid friendship that connects both countries with the United States of America, and the Russian Federation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch interview with Viktor Bout 13 years ago from Thai jail after US sting operation 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked about the role of Saudi Arabia, US officials suggested a number of countries were involved.\n\n“We have and I’m sure we’ll continue to lean on partners around the world to work this through with us and to give us their ideas and to impress upon the Russians how important it is to us to resolve these sorts of cases. We appreciate when those partners do help us,” an administration official said.\n\nBout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Moscow had slammed his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased” and Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nSteve Zissou, Bout’s lawyer in the US, told CNN on Thursday that the prisoner swap between Griner and his client was “fair.”\n\n“As I have urged for some time, given the 15 long years that Viktor Bout has been in custody since the United States government targeted him in 2006, his exchange for Brittney Griner, who has only been in custody for a few months, is fair,” Zissou said in a statement.\n\nZissou told CNN said that his legal team knew a swap was imminent 24 hours ago.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Mj Lee Kevin Liptak", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/19/prisoner-swaps-hostage-negotiations-bill-richardson/11528172002/", "title": "The U.S. works to free Americans held abroad. So does Bill ...", "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. – On a late February morning, the undersecretary for thugs was in jeans and cowboy boots as he piloted the yellow Jeep Wrangler he's had for 10 years into still-sleepy downtown Santa Fe.\n\nHe parked by a low building amid the adobe and art galleries and pulled open a white office door with the unassuming label “W.B.R.” He settled into a leather chair and slid on his reading glasses. Soon he was on a conference call.\n\n“How's our request to see those two Americans in China?” he asked his staff, avoiding some specifics because a USA TODAY journalist was in the room.\n\nThis tiny two-room office, dotted with keepsakes from a lifetime in politics and a power strip sprouting a tangle of phone chargers, was the headquarters of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement.\n\nThe man in the armchair was Bill Richardson, onetime presidential candidate, governor, secretary of energy, U.N. ambassador and congressman, the man who now spends much of his time as a private diplomat working on the crisis faced by more and more American families – finding ways to free their loved ones unjustly detained abroad.\n\n“We've got hostage situations in Russia and Iran, China, Afghanistan,” he said, ticking off a few of the cases he and his small team were working.\n\nThey discussed Paul Whelan, the ex-Marine still being held in Russia. An American long imprisoned in Iran who’s growing despondent. A man jailed in Venezuela, whose home-state governor had asked Richardson to help.\n\nThere’s an Afghanistan case, but the State Department has asked them to pause on that one, he was told – the U.S. believes they have a promising approach. Richardson agreed, but said an anxious family would be pressing for progress. The list of countries and cases went on.\n\nThe voice on the speakerphone was Michael “Mickey” Bergman, director and second-in-command, a former Israeli Defense Forces member who directs the center's work. He was on the line from his home near Washington. Across the room was Richardson’s assistant.\n\nRichardson furrowed his brow and slouched in the armchair, surrounded by the trappings of a life spent in interesting company: A guitar signed by the Eagles sits near a rug bearing the New Mexico state seal from his former job. His staff still calls him “the Governor,” a title he has not held in more than a decade. His reputation as the “undersecretary for thugs” for negotiating with despots was a moniker that one Clinton – Bill – helped give him years before he ran against the other one – Hillary – for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nAt age 75, Richardson remains one of the country’s highest-profile private players working to free American prisoners and hostages in far-flung places – making headlines almost as often as he appears to chafe U.S. administrations with his efforts.\n\nHe has filled a whole book – its subtitle dubs him a \"master negotiator\" – with rollicking tales of high-stakes meetings with tribal leaders and tyrants. He talks with some affection about brokering deals with Fidel, Saddam, Hugo and \"a Kim or two.\"\n\nOn USA TODAY's podcast '5 Things':Correspondent Chris Kenning talks about Americans held abroad\n\nLately, he had been on a good run. Over the preceding 15 months, Bergman says, 19 families in the Richardson Center’s portfolio have been reunited with their loved ones. In December, WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner walked free from a Russian prison in exchange for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. While only the president can approve such high-profile swaps, Griner’s family also issued a public “special thank you” to Richardson for his role in pushing for her release.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials, former captives and their families and representatives say Richardson’s work as a “fringe diplomat” can accelerate releases when others are unable to do so. His high profile can draw global attention to cases. His long list of contacts can open doors or get meetings. His negotiating tactics can flesh out prisoner-swap options for U.S. administrations to consider.\n\nYet for all of his storied exploits and the years he's devoted to hostage negotiations, elements of Richardson’s work remain as mysterious as the distant prison cells in some of his cases.\n\nThe State Department typically says little about how it handled a case, and rarely credits Richardson. Details of what exactly tipped a release – particularly when multiple parties are seeking an American’s return – often remain obscured. That’s fueled some grumbling that he takes outsized credit or could interfere with government efforts. The State Department declined an opportunity to comment on Richardson’s work.\n\nRichardson shrugs off such criticism, saying he only wants to see Americans whose families seek his help come home.\n\nDiane Foley – who created James W. Foley Legacy Foundation in part to improve the way the U.S. handles hostages after her son James was kidnapped and later killed by ISIS in Syria – thinks Richardson plays a valuable role.\n\nShe said the focus on occasional tensions can obscure a larger point.\n\n“The Richardson Center tries very hard to work with our government. But at times, they're frustrating to the government too,\" she said. \"But both sides are doing very good work ... and we need both government and nongovernment people working in this area.\"\n\nMost agree, however, that wrongful detentions are a growing problem, highlighted by Russia’s arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges the U.S. says are false.\n\nWhile hostage-taking historically was the act of terrorists or criminals, many Americans are also held in foreign states under what the U.S. considers unjust charges.\n\nBy one count, at least 54 U.S. citizens or permanent residents are now wrongfully detained or held as hostages in roughly 15 countries, and those are just the cases publicly disclosed – the real figure is thought to be far higher.\n\nIn the past decade, an average of 11 U.S. nationals were wrongfully detained each year, more than twice that from the decade prior, a 2022 report found.\n\nLast year, President Joe Biden declared hostage-taking and wrongful detention a national emergency, adding new tools such as financial sanctions and visa bans. Currently, a Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs seeks to win the release of those designated as wrongfully detained by State Department. An FBI-led multiagency hostage recovery team also works to return Americans held hostage.\n\nBut some hostage advocates and family members still say their cases languish too long in bureaucracy. And that, in turn, has led many to seek additional help from private parties including Richardson.\n\nOn the recent day in his office, Richardson and his staff held a series of calls to discuss some of their cases. They weren’t all headline-making prisoners alleged to be held for political leverage. Some were under-the-radar Americans for whom they were trying to find a way out.\n\n\"All right, Mexico,\" Richardson said. \"This is a case of a Navy veteran, jailed in Mexico for over a decade for a crime that he didn't commit. And we're working on that, without getting into names. Ana, what’s the latest?\"\n\nSo far, said his assistant who was helping on the case, the responses are promising. The key to this case, Bergman chimed in, was to \"applaud the Mexican judicial system for doing the right thing.\"\n\nBut they would have to move carefully.\n\n13 years in prison in Mexico:\n\nCalling in the governor\n\nJust over one month later, Richardson was in Acapulco.\n\nA sleek private jet, provided by insurance magnate Steve Menzies, whose global foundation also supports efforts to free U.S. citizens abroad, waited at the nearby airport.\n\nAlong with several members of his team, he was waiting for 46-year-old James Frisvold to be released from Mexican custody after years behind bars.\n\nRichardson had recently completed a series of meetings with high-ranking officials in Mexico City and Guerrero, a state known for cartel violence.\n\nHe had first been asked to help by Jonathan Franks, a consultant for families of wrongfully detained Americans and a spokesman and strategist for the Bring Our Families Home campaign; Franks was working on behalf of Frisvold’s family, but he had hit a roadblock in his efforts to accelerate long-stalled criminal court proceedings.\n\n\"I can't talk to high-level Mexican officials. They aren't interested in receiving me,” he said.\n\nTo be sure, it wasn’t the sort of case the Richardson Center typically worked on. Most of its cases typically involve prisoners and hostages held by hostile regimes or criminal organizations. It can involve convincing leaders it is in their interest to release prisoners, fleshing out a potential exchange or working through foreign court systems.\n\nIn this case, Frisvold, a Navy veteran living near Sacramento, had been jailed since traveling to Acapulco in 2010 with a golfing friend from home, Jerald Kenneth Schultz, and Shultz's Russian-born wife, Natalya Sidorova.\n\nWhile there, Schultz’s wife was attacked and stabbed by an assailant in a hotel hallway. Surveillance video footage viewed by USA TODAY shows Shultz stepping back to watch the attack and talking with the assailant before getting help.\n\nAfter Schultz was arrested, he identified Frisvold as the killer, Franks said. Both men were charged in connection with the murder.\n\nSchultz died in 2015, according to court documents. But Frisvold remained stuck in prison, claiming innocence in an apparent criminal plot he didn’t understand.\n\nThe prison was “hell,” he said. His family hired attorneys on his behalf, he said, but delays stretched into years. “The translator wouldn't show up. And next thing you know, another year goes by,” he said.\n\nIn 2019, a court threw out a previous conviction, Franks said. Court records show Mexican forensic analysts concluded Frisvold was not the man in the video, and that his fingerprints weren't on the weapon, but delays in a retrial dragged on.\n\nFranks, convinced Frisvold deserved to be freed after scouring thousands of pages of court records and other evidence, got the issue referred to a high court and an investigation launched. But he decided he needed Richardson’s high profile to bring the case to a conclusion.\n\nOn March 29, after a flurry of work and meetings, a Mexican judge acquitted Frisvold of the homicide charge, according to court documents viewed by USA TODAY.\n\nFranks, who said his client’s plight was left to languish by both U.S. officials and Mexican courts, credits Richardson with pushing the case over the finish line.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told USA TODAY the government was “aware” of Frisvold’s release but that, “due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nOn the day he was released, Frisvold said, he was transferred from prison to be processed at an immigration detention center near the tourist center of Acapulco. From there, he met Richardson and his team, including Bergman, at a hotel.\n\n“I fought for my innocence for 13 years,”’ he told USA TODAY. “I'm just grateful to be heading home.”\n\nRichardson joked with him to put him at ease, he recalled, offering him drinks and taking photos. They planned to whisk him to California on the private jet. But there was a problem. Frisvold, after sitting in jail for more than a decade, didn’t have a valid passport.\n\nRichardson’s presence helped there, too.\n\n“Gov was able to interface at a very high level with the embassy,” Franks said, “and we were able to get a passport waiver.”\n\nA 1994 surprise in North Korea:\n\nBecoming the ‘fringe diplomat’\n\nThe job Richardson has carved out freeing Americans began by accident.\n\nIt was 1994, Richardson was deep into a career as a U.S. Representative from Santa Fe, and he was on a Congressional trip to North Korea to discuss nuclear issues.\n\nWhile he was there, a U.S. Army helicopter was shot down after it veered off course in the demilitarized zone that separates North from South Korea. One American died and the other was taken into North Korean custody.\n\n“I remember Secretary of State Warren Christopher calling me and saying, ‘Don't leave, please, until you get the two pilots out.’”\n\nThe visit stretched into five days of tense negotiations pressing for the return of one soldier’s remains and freedom for the other, which he eventually won.\n\nSimilar exploits over the next two years and beyond built his reputation as a go-to negotiator for wresting prisoners from dictators, terrorists and regimes hostile to the United States.\n\nHe traveled to Baghdad for a one-on-one with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two Americans who had wandered over the Kuwaiti border.\n\nSaddam Hussein at one point slammed his fist on the table and walked out, after Richardson inadvertently crossed his legs, creating a cultural offense by showing the bottom of his shoes.\n\nRichardson said he decided not to apologize or to leave, a show of resolve that he credits with eventually salvaging his mission.\n\nIn 1996, Sudanese rebels had taken two Red Cross workers and a New Mexico constituent hostage. They were held in a reed hut on a $2.5 million ransom. Richardson flew in an old cargo plane to meet the rebel leader.\n\nAfter sharing chunks of goat meat as boys with AK-47s stood nearby, he talked the leader into accepting rice, radios, four Jeeps, a health survey and a promise to work on resolving conflict in the area, according to reports at the time and Richardson's own account of the episode.\n\nUpon Richardson's return, the Washington Post declared, “The once low-profile lawmaker is now called the Clark Kent of Capitol Hill.”\n\nThen-national security adviser Anthony Lake and others quoted in the story said Richardson’s personal touch, along with his ability to operate as a “friend of the administration, but not part of the administration,\" made him effective.\n\nSoon, he would be part of the administration.\n\nShortly after Richardson returned from Sudan, President Clinton appointed him as Ambassador to the United Nations, joking in the Rose Garden that he’d just returned from a rebel chieftain's hut in Sudan.\n\nLater, Richardson recalled how Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told him things had now changed: “You can't be an outlaw ambassador. You’re in the administration.”\n\n“President Clinton used to say Bill knew all the thugs,” Richardson’s wife, Barbara, to whom he has been married for five decades, recalled. “He had a knack for it. And I think he liked the adventure of it. And it just sort of grew from there.”\n\nFrom the post at the United Nations, the Richardsons lived in New York while meeting key contacts from around the globe that would serve him later. His former U.N. counterpart from Russia was at the time a man named Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov. Today, Lavrov is Russia’s foreign minister.\n\nRichardson went on to serve as energy secretary and two terms as governor of New Mexico, and to make a short-lived run at the presidency. He still was called on to broker releases with difficult leaders and countries – bringing both success, shortfalls and heartbreaking ends.\n\nIn 2006, he rescued Paul Salopek, a Chicago Tribune reporter, from Sudan. In 2013, he tried but fell short of bringing back imprisoned missionary Kenneth Bae from North Korea. A few years later, he helped get Otto Warmbier, an Ohio college student, home – but Warmbier, who had become comatose during captivity, died soon after.\n\nRichardson in 2011 founded his nonprofit to do that work without taking any money from the desperate families who sought his help. Donations – which records show have fluctuated but which Bergman said in 2022 was roughly a million dollars – come largely from wealthy supporters and several grantors. Richardson takes no salary, but those fund a small staff that includes his assistant and several consultants including former U.S. ambassador and career diplomat Cameron Hume and Bergman. Richardson first heard of Bergman through his international humanitarian work in Sudan, which led to their first foreign mission.\n\n\"I get a phone call one morning and this rough-sounding voice comes on the line and says: 'This is Gov. Richardson. I need you to pack your stuff and get your ass to Santa Fe. You're flying with me to Khartoum,’” Bergman recalled.\n\nBergman now works on everything from bookkeeping and fundraising to logistics and negotiation strategy. He said he and Richardson – who he described as a charismatic negotiator who can charm, bluff and bully – play off each other for different needs depending on the case.\n\n“He might be the one threatening and bullying and burning a bridge, and I'm going to be the one kind of like, ‘Hey, guys, you know, we can still fix it,’” he said.\n\nThe Richardson Center isn't the only private group that seeks to negotiate the return of captives at the request of families, said Foley, whose foundation maintains a list of groups or people who are credible and ethical. But most work confidentially and stay \"under the radar,\" she said, while Richardson Center is among the most public with whom they work.\n\nOver the years, Richardson found success as well as controversy in the same gray area he had staked out early on: as a friend of the administration, not part of the administration.\n\nThey choose cases where they think they make a difference, Richardson said. Currently, Richardson has let the family of Gershkovich know that the Richardson Center’s “door is open and they can reach out if they want to, but we’re not pushing,” according to Bergman.\n\nOnce he’s working a case, that means keeping in touch with contacts inside and outside the government. This can mean officials from the U.S. State Department, National Security Council and the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Outside government, this can mean a revolving cast of former diplomats, intelligence and law enforcement officials. U.S. officials who have worked closely with Richardson declined an opportunity to comment on his efforts.\n\nBut it can also mean pressing on alone when needed.\n\n“We try to coordinate with the U.S. government when it's helpful, but we don't work for the government,” Richardson said. “We consult with them. Our responsibility is to the families.”\n\nFoley said Richardson's brand of private diplomacy has often been \"very effective, just through personal relationships.”\n\nA cold January on the Russian border:\n\nOld friends in high places\n\nUnder lead-gray skies and freezing January winds along the Polish border, Bergman was in his car on a reconnaissance trip.\n\nIt was January 2023, and he and Richardson were hoping to retrieve Taylor Dudley. The 35-year-old Lansing, Michigan, man had been imprisoned by Russia nine months earlier after apparently wandering into the country while backpacking in Europe.\n\nHe was set to be released from jail in Kaliningrad, a small patch of Russian territory surrounded by Poland and Lithuania and a small strip of Baltic Sea coastline, and Bergman was checking the entry points in case the Russian dropoff plan suddenly changed.\n\nDudley was taken prisoner in April 2022, though he hadn’t been designated by the U.S. as having been wrongfully detained.\n\nHis family soon appealed to the Richardson Center, who brought in Franks, the crisis consultant, who believed the U.S. wasn’t doing enough on the case.\n\nRichardson already had his hands full with cases connected to Russia that year, seeking to speed up a deal in several that had grabbed media attention.\n\nThere was Whelan, the Michigan corporate security executive deemed wrongfully detained in 2018 on suspicion of spying and later sentenced to 16 years. There was Reed, detained in 2019 after an alleged drunken assault on two Moscow police officers. And there was Griner, arrested in 2022 after police said they found cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\nRichardson traveled to Russia at least twice in 2022, Hume said, to have dinner meetings at Moscow restaurants. At those meetings: Lavrov, his long-ago counterpart at the U.N. – now the top Russian diplomat charged with explaining the decisions of his boss Vladimir Putin. Those moves, from the invasion of Ukraine to support for dictators, have turned Moscow into a pariah in much of the world.\n\nThe Richardson Center, in addition to working their array of contacts, was also advising Griner's family and supporters, said her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas. \"We did not make any major moves without consulting them,\" Colas said. Griner's wife or representatives \"spoke with Mickey on almost a daily basis.\"\n\nThat same year saw tensions bubble to the surface with some administration officials – stoking a narrative that has clung to Richardson for years.\n\nIn July of that year, Politico reported that Richardson often sparked eye rolls, citing anonymous sources to report that \"many within the White House and State Department feel that while the governor cares about the families, he also uses detainees as a way to maintain relevance in international affairs, and takes credit for efforts where he played little role.” (Bergman said that \"Sometimes, the extent of our involvement is not known or understood by every government official.\")\n\nThen in September, as the work to secure Griner’s release gathered pace, State Department spokesman Ned Price warned such private intervention could foil government efforts.\n\n\"We want to make sure that any outside effort is fully and transparently coordinated with us,\" he said. \"In this case, we believe that any efforts that fall outside of that officially designated channel have the potential to complicate what is already an extraordinarily complicated challenge that we face.\"\n\nRichardson, no stranger to such friction, was not dismayed.\n\nHe kept working his contacts in Russia.\n\n“The visits to Russia, especially the one in September, were highly critical for the Dudley case,” said Bergman.\n\nAnother key contact was Ara Abramyan, an Armenian businessman and Russian-speaking philanthropist and president of the Union of Armenians of Russia, an organization that represents the interests of one of Russia's largest ethnic minority groups.\n\nAbramyan had the ear of senior officials in the Kremlin. He had already worked behind the scenes to help free Reed, who was traded in late April 2022 for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine.\n\nReed’s father, Joey Reed, said he believes that release was aided by a White House meeting with President Joe Biden. But he also credits Richardson for adding to the push for both sides to come to an agreement.\n\n“It all depends upon the president, but had (Richardson) not gone and broke the ice and put deals on the table? I don't know how far the bureaucracy would have gone,” said Joey Reed.\n\nAbramyan would also play a role in freeing Griner, who was traded eight months later for Bout, the notorious Russian arms dealer. Abramyan could not be reached for comment for this story.\n\nWhen it came to Dudley – whose release was not a trade but a humanitarian appeal – the Richardson Center said in a statement that it went to work “discreetly,” traveling to Moscow and Kaliningrad “multiple times, liaising with our Russian counterparts and conduits.”\n\nWhatever the strategy’s fine print, it worked.\n\nJust a few weeks after Griner’s return, Richardson got word Dudley would be released – deported, technically – on Jan. 12. He and Bergman traveled to the Polish border with Dudley’s mother.\n\n\"We knew which crossing the Russians were going to bring him over through,\" said Bergman. \"But we had to be prepared in case they changed their mind, in case they decided last-minute to use a different crossing. So we drove to all of them so we knew what we were dealing with.\"\n\nFinally, their two rental vans waited near the Russia-Poland Bagrationovsk-Bezledy border crossing.\n\nRichardson, Bergman and an American security contractor were in the front van.\n\nFranks, Taylor's mother, Shelley VanConant, a doctor, and a second American security contractor followed closely.\n\nBoth vehicles pulled up close to the Russian checkpoint.\n\nThe Russian authorities had deposited Dudley on a charter bus that was also carrying Russians who were crossing into Poland to go shopping.\n\nDudley and his mother embraced tightly after months of fear and anxiety.\n\n\"He looked a little dazed,\" said Franks, explaining it’s not an uncommon reaction. “Part of them is like, 'OK, is this real? Am I actually out?”\n\nA secret deal in Myanmar:\n\n‘Who is this guy?’\n\nIn late 2021, Richardson found himself in Myanmar’s capital city.\n\nHe sat on a chair across from the leader of a military junta globally condemned for a coup, a deadly crackdown on government protests and persecution of the Rohingya minority.\n\nThe former governor was ostensibly in Naypyitaw to discuss COVID-19 and humanitarian aid. But his eyes were on an American journalist named Danny Fenster.\n\nU.S. officials, however, had specifically asked Richardson not to bring him up.\n\nFenster, 38, spent six months in a Myanmar prison after he was detained over false claims he violated the country's immigration and terrorism laws. He’d become a global cause celebre.\n\nAccording to Bergman, State Department officials believed they were making progress on Fenster’s release and had asked Richardson to postpone the trip to Myanmar. They wanted him to sit tight and let the process unfold, fearing Richardson would set back their efforts.\n\nBut after a few weeks of stalling, Richardson concluded he couldn’t further delay a difficult-to-get invitation from senior Myanmar officials to talk about vaccines and the country’s humanitarian needs – topics he viewed as a “Trojan horse” that could give him a window to bring up Fenster, Bergman said.\n\nBergman informed the State Department the trip was going ahead. He told Fenster’s family that U.S. officials asked Richardson not to raise Fenster’s name while he was there.\n\nHe heard what they had to say, but made no such commitment either way.\n\nRichardson was familiar with Myanmar, previously known as Burma, through past work with former leader Aung San Suu Kyi dating to the 1990s. Since then, Suu Kyi had been deposed, military leader Min Aung Hlaing was in charge, and now Fenster was in jail.\n\n\"We’d been working on it for about a year, quietly, with the Burmese,” Richardson said. “But with the Burmese, it's the leader, the general, who decides. Everything else doesn't matter.”\n\nBut how? He wasn’t asking for a prisoner exchange.\n\nMin Aung Hlaing was a man used to crushing dissent through violence, covert interrogations and fear. But he was also shy. This appeared to be a potential opening.\n\nRichardson asked to talk to him alone.\n\nHe flattered Min Aung Hlaing by telling him he possessed a \"quiet leadership,\" one all the more powerful because it deliberately avoided melodrama and bluster. The two men started talking about their families. A connection was being formed.\n\nRichardson decided he was on a roll. He pressed further.\n\n“There’s this American,” Richardson recalled saying, appealing for Fenster's release by telling the general it could help his poor image in the U.S. “It would be good for the American people, they'd like it because (Fenster’s) been in the news a lot. Let him go. Let me take him back.”\n\nThe general seemed to agree to Richardson’s proposal. But he wouldn’t do it right away.\n\n“I'm going to give him to you,” Myanmar’s leader said, as Bergman would later recall in an interview for a podcast. “And I'm going to do it here. But it's going to take me time.” The governor looked at him, laughed and he said, “Well, I have my plane here for two more days.”\n\nIt was going to take more time than that. Two weeks, maybe a month.\n\nRichardson reluctantly agreed he would come back for Fenster.\n\nHe also asked for the release of a lower-profile person, a local imprisoned activist who had worked for the Richardson Center in Myanmar. The general agreed. She was delivered to their hotel the next day.\n\nBut when Richardson left Mymanar, his entire discussion about Fenster with the general was still a secret, Bergman says.\n\nAnd because Richardson returned home without Fenster, he took a barrage of public and private criticism for giving the junta credibility. In fact, about a week later, Fenster was sentenced to 11 years of hard labor in prison.\n\n“Did zilch, zero nothing for human rights in #Myanmar while giving a propaganda win to #Burma’s nasty, rights abusing military junta. Pathetic,” Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director, tweeted at the time. Robertson declined to comment for this story.\n\nBut the draconian sentence had all been part of a familiar process, a performance, Bergman says now, allowing the general to later pardon Fenster.\n\nNot long after, Richardson was called back to Myanmar and Fenster was being delivered to the airport. Richardson and Bergman were there with an airplane to pick him up.\n\nFenster’s clothes were a mess and he had on flip-flops that were falling apart. He’d been surviving on rice and water for six months. On the plane ride home with Richardson and Bergman, he devoured a shrimp cocktail, beer and coffee.\n\nDespite the earlier criticism, Richardson’s gamble had paid off.\n\n\"I knew I had an opportunity, and we got him out,\" he said.\n\nAfterward, Roger Carstens, the Biden administration’s special envoy for hostage affairs, thanked Richardson for securing Fenster’s release.\n\n“I just can't get upset when the governor actually brings him home. We have no pride of authorship. Whoever can come up with a plan and get someone out, we're down for the win,” he told 60 Minutes.\n\nA White House spokesperson later told Rolling Stone magazine that it was, in fact, the U.S. government that secured Fenster’s release.\n\nAnd while Fenster believes Richardson's intervention played a big role in his release, he doesn't want to discount the possibility that Myanmar's authorities, who he described as \"incompetent\" and perhaps not fully aware of what they were doing when they detained an American journalist, may have been looking for an excuse to get rid of him.\n\n\"They had a lot of people asking them to let me go and maybe they were just like, 'Well, here's somebody to give him to,'\" said Fenster. He stressed that he remains hugely appreciative to Bergman and Richardson for advocating on his behalf.\n\nSome hostage advocates, such as Foley, say the reality is that the goal of returning captive Americans often benefits from both private and public efforts. That’s been true in the most recent case of the detained Wall Street Journal reporter.\n\n“We’re trying to bring all elements of this government. … Trying to partner with members on Capitol Hill, members of the media, frankly, third-party intermediaries, nonprofits, NGOs and also the family to bring Evan home,” Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy, said in a recent interview with NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nA top Russian diplomat has said that Russia might be willing to discuss a prisoner swap. “We have a working channel that was used in the past to achieve concrete agreements,\" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a state news agency, according to the Associated Press. But Ryabkov said any discussion with the U.S. would happen only after Gershkovich's trial.\n\nIn Fenster's case, he discovered that his sentencing was a step toward freedom.\n\nIn the podcast about the Fenster case, Bergman describes the moment Myanmar officials handed Fenster over to him at the airport.\n\n\"He's like, 'Mickey, I need to ask you a question, I'm sorry, I just – who is this guy?'\"\n\nBergman blinked, asking him, “'You mean, Gov. Richardson?'\"\n\n“That's what I thought!” Fenster replied. “But I was told last week that he's the reason I got the sentencing!'\"\n\nBergman, recounting the story, seems to smile.\n\n“Well, you were told a lot of things that were not accurate,” he told Fenster. “But it doesn't matter. … We're going home.\"\n\nBack home in Santa Fe:\n\nThe governor gets things done\n\nBack in his office in Santa Fe, Richardson finished strategizing on detained Americans and launched into other projects his nonprofit was working on.\n\nHe got an update on humanitarian programs for displaced Rohingya, then met to talk about a Navajo Nation aid project.\n\nHe was also planning for an interview with a Russian state media reporter, in which he hoped to telegraph a message welcoming prisoner negotiations. Then he set aside his cases for a break to visit his favorite lunch joint in his adopted home town.\n\nOver his three decades of high-wire negotiations and secretive meetings in nations with little love for the United States, it’s here that Richardson returns home to decompress.\n\nRichardson moved here in 1978, after a childhood that prepared him for the work he does now.\n\nHe grew up immersed in a bilingual home and school in Mexico City, the son of a U.S. Citibank executive, which impressed on him the importance of dialogue, language and diplomacy, before attending boarding school in Massachusetts as a young teen.\n\nRichardson wanted to play baseball for a living. Instead, he studied politics and international affairs before working in positions including under Henry Kissinger’s State Department.\n\nAll these years later, much has changed about the work and the world he travels in.\n\nBut there are constants: He needs to find a key that will open a door for desperate families, and captives.\n\nOn the day in late February, Richardson said he was pained that he wasn’t able to free Whelan along with Griner, who he initially thought would be part of the same prisoner swap.\n\nHe was also trying to find an opening for prisoners in Iran, including Emad Shargi, an American businessman who was first arrested in Iran in 2015 and is held at Tehran’s Evin Prison.\n\nHis sister, Neda Sharghi, who spells her last name differently, said she’s frustrated with the lack of progress by the U.S. government. She’s been unable to meet with President Biden in hopes of making it a bigger priority.\n\n\"I hear that it's complicated. And I hear that this is their top priority. But that's it,\" said Sharghi, who is part of the Bring Our Families Home campaign.\n\nFamilies of hostages have become increasingly vocal and organized since Foley and other captives were killed in 2014 and 2015, an episode that partly led to a hostage policy overhaul under the Obama administration that created the hostage envoy and recovery team.\n\nBefore then, the federal government insisted on secrecy in such cases, but that secrecy meant both the public and the hostages’ families had no way to know what was being done. “I tried to work with the U.S. government when Jim was captured,” Diane Foley said in 2019. “It was terrible at the time. It was nobody's job.” (Former President Donald Trump broke with decades of U.S. hostage policy in his own way, using Twitter and photo opportunities to inject himself into the process and highlight his self-professed skills as a deal-maker.)\n\nShe says the U.S. approach still can be too inefficient, slow and opaque. Neda Sharghi, who turned to Richardson for help, said she knows he can’t bargain on behalf of the government. But she said the center has provided key guidance for the family as they push publicly for a deal leading to his release.\n\n“I always say go public. The government says no, don’t, because then you raise the stakes,” Richardson says. “It's better to have the press and pundits and Congress advocating for you.”\n\nSharghi said keeping a case in the public eye can be critical.\n\n\"What the Richardson center always reminds everyone is that, at the end of the day, these are human beings that are being used, and it's our responsibility to do whatever is needed to bring them home,\" she said.\n\nSoon Richardson was bellying up to the bar to order a tamale and posole next to a group of friends and lunch regulars.\n\n“Hey Gov,” several said as they walked in.\n\nThe down-to-earth affability that aided him as a politician and negotiator was on full display. He shook hands, traded banter and tried to stump a friend in a cowboy hat and turquoise ring, who says he once worked for Elvis, with baseball and music trivia.\n\nAt one point, a man came up behind him to ask him for help with a family immigration issue.\n\nRichardson doesn’t get involved in many issues in New Mexico. But it’s not surprising if he’s seen as a problem-solver, the undersecretary who might just get it done.\n\nHe leaned his head in.\n\n“What do we need to do?”\n\nContributing: Rick Jervis, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/02/bill-richardson-dead-at-75/70750485007/", "title": "Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor and UN ambassador ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Bill Richardson, the politician and diplomat who came to be one of the most influential negotiators for Americans held hostage abroad, died Friday at age 75.\n\nThough he had been a congressman, a cabinet secretary and a 2008 presidential candidate, he went always by the moniker \"the Governor,\" from his time as governor of his home state of New Mexico.\n\nYet the governor carved out perhaps his greatest influence later in life, as an international advocate who worked both inside and outside government channels. His role in freeing hostages and other wrongly detained Americans earned him a nickname from President Bill Clinton: \"undersecretary for thugs.\"\n\nMore from USA TODAY:Bill Richardson's endless push to free Americans detained abroad\n\nRichardson, who still lived in New Mexico, died at his summer home in Chatham, Massachusetts.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2023\n\n“Governor Richardson passed away peacefully in his sleep last night,” said Mickey Bergman, vice president of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, which Richardson ran.\n\n“He lived his entire life in the service of others – including both his time in government and his subsequent career helping to free people held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,” Bergman said. “There was no person that Governor Richardson would not speak with if it held the promise of returning a person to freedom. The world has lost a champion for those held unjustly abroad and I have lost a mentor and a dear friend.”\n\nIn recent years, Richardson spent much of his time as a private diplomat representing the growing number of American families seeking to free loved ones who had been unjustly detained in other countries. He filled a whole biography with tales of his high-stakes meetings with tribal leaders and tyrants, writing about brokering deals with Fidel, Saddam, Hugo and \"a Kim or two.\"\n\nRichardson's death was mourned by prisoner advocates and leaders at every level.\n\nNeda Sharghi, chair of the nonprofit Bring Our Families Home Campaign, was one of the many people who sought Richardson's counsel. Her brother, Emad Shargi, who spells his surname differently, is an American businessman who has been held in Iran since 2015, and is the subject of discussions of a possible prisoner swap.\n\n“On behalf of the countless families that Governor Richardson and his Center have helped, I wanted to express our profound feeling of loss at his passing,\" Sharghi said. “Governor Richardson has been a fierce advocate for human rights and the effort to bring home people unjustly held overseas.”\n\n“Governor Richardson was a mentor of mine and he will be missed by many, including and especially the countless families he helped over the years,” said Jon Franks, who worked with Richardson to secure the release of Americans detained overseas including Trevor Reed, a former Marine who was detained in Russia in 2019.\n\n\"Few have served our nation in as many capacities or with as much relentlessness, creativity, and good cheer,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"But perhaps his most lasting legacy will be the work Bill did to free Americans held in some of the most dangerous places on Earth.\"\n\nBill Richardson the hostage negotiator\n\nRichardson's identity as a foreign negotiator began by accident. In 1994, he was a U.S. Representative from Santa Fe. He happened to be a Congressional trip to North Korea when a U.S. Army helicopter was shot down after it veered off course in the demilitarized zone that separates North from South Korea. One American died and the other was taken into North Korean custody.\n\n“I remember Secretary of State Warren Christopher calling me and saying, ‘Don't leave, please, until you get the two pilots out,’” Richardson said later. He stayed for five days of tense negotiations and eventually won the return of one soldier’s remains and freedom for the other.\n\nHis reputation grew thanks to similar exploits in the years that followed. He traveled to Baghdad to secure the release of two Americans who had wandered over the Kuwaiti border. He later described the precarious negotiation with Saddam Hussein: At one point, Richardson inadvertently crossed his legs, creating a cultural offense by showing the bottom of his shoes. Saddam slammed his fist on the table and walked out. Richardson said the decision not to apologize or leave was a show of resolve that salvaged the effort.\n\nOther efforts led to more tragic endings. In 2013, Richardson tried but fell short of bringing back imprisoned missionary Kenneth Bae from North Korea. A few years later, he helped get Otto Warmbier, an Ohio college student, home – but Warmbier, who had become comatose during captivity, died soon after.\n\nBill Clinton and Bill Richardson\n\nRichardson's reputation as the “undersecretary for thugs” was one that President Bill Clinton helped establish for him, years before Richardson ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nRichardson had just returned from Sudan, where Sudanese rebels had taken Red Cross workers and a New Mexico constituent hostage. They were held in a reed hut on a $2.5 million ransom. Richardson flew in an old cargo plane to meet the rebel leader, and successfully negotiated a release in exchange for rice, radios, four Jeeps, a health survey and a promise to work on resolving conflict in the area.\n\nUpon Richardson's return, the Washington Post declared, “The once low-profile lawmaker is now called the Clark Kent of Capitol Hill.”\n\nShortly after the return from Sudan, President Clinton appointed him as Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n“President Clinton used to say Bill knew all the thugs,” Richardson’s wife, Barbara, told USA TODAY in an interview earlier this year. “He had a knack for it. And I think he liked the adventure of it. And it just sort of grew from there.”\n\nFrom the post at the United Nations, Richardson went on to serve as energy secretary and two terms as governor of New Mexico, and to make a short-lived run at the presidency.\n\nThe two politicians later formed a deep rift, though, which Richardson said was a result of his decision not to endorse Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries. He threw his support, instead, to Barack Obama. Richardson later wrote about how his decision had complicated their relationship.\n\nThe Clintons, in a statement Saturday, said they were deeply saddened by Richardson's death.\n\n\"His innate diplomatic skills made him a success at the U.N., and his roots in the West, and his experience, helped him succeed as Secretary of Energy,\" they said. \"Whether in an official or unofficial capacity, he was a masterful and persistent negotiator who helped make our world more secure.\"\n\nMore:Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson: 5 things you may not know about his life and legacy\n\n'The governor': Bill Richardson and New Mexico\n\nEven at age 75, Bill Richardson's staff and many others referred to him as \"the Governor,\" a title he had not held in more than a decade.\n\n“New Mexico, our country, and, frankly, the entire world lost a champion today,\" New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement Saturday. \"Bill Richardson was a titan among us, fighting for the little guy, world peace, and everything in between. He was a visionary who saw the potential of our great state before so many others did.\"\n\nRichardson was the nation’s only Hispanic governor during his two terms, according to the Associated Press. As governor, Richardson signed legislation in 2009 that repealed the death penalty, raised teacher salaries and the state minimum wage, and implemented renewable energy requirements.\n\nU.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-NM, called Richardson \"a titan in New Mexico and abroad” on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"I mourn the passing of this New Mexico legend, one of the most powerful Hispanics in politics that this nation has seen,\" Vasquez said. \"Today, we reflect on his decades of service and for always proudly representing New Mexico.\"\n\nRichardson continued to live in New Mexico, driving an aging Jeep Wrangler to a modest office in downtown Santa Fe where he ran the Richardson Center's efforts, talking by phone to contacts across the globe.\n\nBill Richardson's role in freeing Brittney Griner\n\nRichardson contributed to efforts to broker a deal for the release of Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who spent 10 months in a Russian prison after she was detained for allegedly possessing cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner was eventually exchanged for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange illuminated the shadowy but central role Richardson could play in such deals.\n\nOnly the U.S. president can authorize such high-profile prisoner swaps, but after Griner’s release in December 2022, her family issued a public “special thank you\" to Richardson.\n\nGriner's agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, previously told USA TODAY, referring to Richardson and his director and second-in-command at the Richardson Center, Mickey Bergman, \"We did not make any major moves without consulting them.\" Griner's wife or representatives \"spoke with Mickey on almost a daily basis.\"\n\nIn late 2021, Richardson made headlines again for his role in freeing American journalist Danny Fenster in Myanmar.\n\nFenster, 38, became a global figure while he spent six months in a Myanmar prison after he was detained over claims he violated the country's immigration and terrorism laws. Richardson was familiar with Myanmar, previously known as Burma, through past work with former leader Aung San Suu Kyi dating to the 1990s.\n\nRichardson and Bergman later described secret negotiations they said they had with Myanmar's new miliatary leader. When Richardson returned home without Fenster, he took a barrage of public and private criticism for giving the junta credibility.\n\nBut not long after, Richardson flew to Myanmar again, in a deal he said he had privately arranged, and picked up Fenster. \"I knew I had an opportunity, and we got him out,\" Richardson later told USA TODAY.\n\nBill Richardson Nobel Peace Prize nominations\n\nRichardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last month for his efforts in freeing hostages and other wrongly detained Americans. He told The Hill that he was “ honored by this nomination of a prestigious award, knowing it’s a long shot.”\n\nHe had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize on several other occasions, such as in 2019 for his work in North Korea seeking the release of hostages there. But his latest nomination was notable since it was backed by four senators, the Hill reported.\n\n\"Proud to be one of the four Senators who advocated for this nomination,\" Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-NM, posted on Facebook last month. \"Our former governor has spent his post-political career dedicated to the safe return of political prisoners and hostages around the world and I am enormously grateful for his service.\"\n\nOver the years, Richardson found success as well as controversy in the role he carved out as an international negotiator, a space he sometimes described as being a friend of the U.S. administration, but not part of the administration.\n\nOutside government channels, that could mean working Richardson's contacts: a revolving cast of former diplomats, intelligence and law enforcement officials. U.S. officials who worked closely with Richardson generally declined to comment on his efforts.\n\nRichardson, in an interview with USA TODAY earlier this year, said he would collaborate with American officials, but would also press on alone when needed.\n\n“We try to coordinate with the U.S. government when it's helpful, but we don't work for the government,” Richardson said. “We consult with them. Our responsibility is to the families.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/americas/viktor-bout-profile-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html", "title": "Viktor Bout: The Russian arms dealer swapped for Brittney Griner ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrittney Griner’s freedom ultimately hinged on the release of a convicted Russian arms dealer whose life story inspired a Hollywood film.\n\nThe US basketball star was released on Thursday from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” by his accusers.\n\nBout, a former Soviet military officer, was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly called for Bout’s release, slamming his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased.”\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry said Thursday that Bout was returned to Russia after the exchange at Abu Dhabi Airport. Footage shared by Russian state television later showed Bout walking on a tarmac in Abu Dhabi, then boarding and sitting down inside a plane, which later landed in Moscow.\n\n“For a long time, the Russian Federation has been negotiating with the United States on the release of V. A. Bout,” the ministry said in a statement. “Washington categorically refused dialogue on the inclusion of the Russian [citizen] in the exchange scheme. Nevertheless, the Russian Federation continued to actively work to rescue our compatriot.”\n\nIt added that as a result of Russia’s negotiations with the US, Bout had been “returned to his homeland.”\n\nBout’s US lawyer, Steve Zissou, said that Bout was with his wife and daughter. “We are grateful that after 15 long years, Viktor has finally been reunited with his family,” he added.\n\nGriner – who had for years played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nThe swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16-years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair.\n\nGriner and Whelan’s families had urged the White House to secure their release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary.\n\nAt the center of their bid was Bout, a man who eluded international arrest warrants and asset freezes for years.\n\nThe Russian businessman, who speaks six languages, was arrested in a sting operation in 2008 led by US drug enforcement agents in Thailand posing as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the acronym FARC. He was eventually extradited to the US in 2010 after a protracted court proceeding.\n\n“Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,” said Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan when Bout was sentenced in New York in 2012.\n\n“He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans.”\n\nThe trial honed in on Bout’s role in supplying weapons to FARC, a guerrilla group that waged an insurgency in Colombia until 2016. The US said the weapons were intended to kill US citizens.\n\nBut Bout’s history in the arms trade extended much further afield. He has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s, fueling bloody conflicts from Liberia to Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted US authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and blocked any US transactions.\n\nBout has repeatedly maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and acted as a mere logistics provider. He is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents.\n\nViktor Bout is pictured in a temporary cell ahead of a hearing at a court in Bangkok in August 2010. Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“His early days are a mystery,” Douglas Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center who co-authored a book on Bout, told CNN in 2010.\n\nFarah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. He said that Bout graduated from the Military Institute on Foreign Languages, a well-known feeder school for Russian military intelligence.\n\n“He was a Soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the USSR and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from Moscow to Kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional Soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from Africa to the Philippines,” Farah told the magazine.\n\nBout has said that he worked as a military officer in Mozambique. Others have said it was actually Angola, where Russia had a large military presence at the time, Farah told CNN. He first became known when the United Nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the United States began to get involved.\n\nBout – who reportedly has used names including “Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,” “Victor But,” “Viktor Butt,” “Viktor Bulakin” and “Vadim Markovich Aminov” – is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms-dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie “Lord of War.”\n\nIn 2002, CNN’s Jill Dougherty met with Bout in Moscow. She asked him about allegations against him – did he sell arms to the Taliban? To al Qaeda? Did he supply rebels in Africa and get paid in blood diamonds? – and he denied each claim.\n\n“It’s a false allegation and it’s a lie,” he said. “I’ve never touched diamonds in my life and I’m not a diamond guy and I don’t want that business.”\n\n“I’m not afraid,” he told Dougherty. “I didn’t do anything in my life I should be afraid of.”", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/30/whc-dinner-biden-vowed-free-wrongly-detained-americans-abroad/11770687002/", "title": "WHC dinner: Biden vowed to free wrongly detained Americans abroad", "text": "Farnoush Amiri\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — The White House Correspondents' Association dinner — known for its fun albeit ferocious jabs at Washington — took a more solemn tone this year as President Joe Biden acknowledged the several American journalists under siege in authoritarian countries around the world.\n\n“We are here to send a message to the country and, quite frankly, to the world: The free press is a pillar, maybe the pillar, of a free society, not the enemy,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association Dinner is an annual event that brings members of the press, politicians and celebrities together to celebrate the work of journalists who cover the White House and promote the First Amendment.\n\nThis year, the event took place about a month after a Wall Street Journal Moscow correspondent Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia and charged with spying, despite strong denials from his employer and the U.S. government.\n\n“We're working every day to secure his release,” Biden said.\n\nUpon arriving at the Washington Hilton, the president and first lady Jill Biden met privately with Gershkovich's parents. Some guests wore buttons with “Free Evan” printed on them.\n\nBut Gershkovich is one of a number of Americans held overseas on what the U.S. officials call false charges.\n\nAmong the 2,600 people attending the gala is Debra Tice, the mother of Austin Tice, who has not been heard from since disappearing at a checkpoint in Syria in 2012. U.S. officials say they operate under the assumption that he is alive and are working to try to bring him home.\n\n“They are among hundreds of journalists around the world who are wrongfully detained for the simple act of doing journalism — which is not a crime,” said Tamara Keith, a White House correspondent for NPR and the association’s president.\n\nThe Bidens also made a beeline for Brittney Griner, the WNBA star and Olympic gold medalist who was detained in Russia for nearly 10 months last year before her release in a prisoner swap. Griner is attending with her wife, Cherelle, as guests of CBS News.\n\nThe black-tie dinner draws a wide array of celebrities and media moguls to Washington, with parties being held across the capital. Among those in attendance are actor Liev Schreiber, singer John Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, the model and television personality.\n\nActor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opened the dinner with a pre-taped video about the importance of a free and independent press. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are seated on the stage along with comedian Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent for “The Daily Show,” as the featured entertainer.\n\nWood gave a preview of where his jokes were headed, predicting that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn’t likely to end his culture clashes or stop his feud with Disney just because of a few jibes. The comedian told CNN not to expect DeSantis to say, \"'You know what, man, you’re right. Go ahead and put Black history back in them books.’ ... He’s fighting Mickey Mouse. You can’t change that person’s mind with a joke.\"\n\nThe venue is a familiar one for Biden, who attended several as vice president to Barack Obama. The Washington event returned last year after being sidelined by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Biden was the first president in six years to accept the invitation after Donald Trump shunned the event while in office.\n\nBiden took the opportunity last year to take aim at his many critics, including Republicans and the leader of their party: Trump. This year, he is coming not only as the commander-in-chief but as a presidential contender.\n\nNikol Mudrová contributed to the reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/us-delegation-venezuela-no-detainee-release/index.html", "title": "US delegation unable to secure release of Americans detained in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA US delegation that traveled to Venezuela this week was unable to secure the release of any of the Americans detained there.\n\nUS Special President Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens was able to meet with wrongfully detained Americans while in the capital city of Caracas and discussed “with senior Maduro regime officials the importance of ensuring that they receive appropriate care where needed,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN.\n\nHowever, the visit by Carstens and Ambassador Jimmy Story, who heads the US’ Venezuelan Affairs Unit, ended Thursday without any of the Americans whom the US considers wrongfully detained being able to return home.\n\nThere are at least eight Americans currently known to be wrongfully detained in Venezuela – five of the six American oil executives known collectively as the “CITGO 6” – Tomeu Vadell, Jorge Toledo, Alirio Jose Zambrano, Jose Luis Zambrano and Jose Angel Pereira – along with Luke Denman, Airan Berry and Matthew Heath.\n\n“We will continue to press for the immediate and unconditional release of all wrongfully detained US nationals in Venezuela at every opportunity,” the State Department spokesperson said.\n\nA senior State Department official told CNN that the discussions between the US and Maduro officials were “constructive but both sides have more work to do to narrow the gaps” between their positions. “Some progress” was made from previous discussions between the two sides, according to the State official, who said there is also a feeling that there is “an open line of communication on this topic” between the US and the regime of Nicolas Maduro, whom the US does not recognize as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.\n\nThe official declined to provide specific details about the discussions or say whom Carstens and Story met with from the Maduro government, but Carstens was able to visit with all of the Americans whom the State Department considers wrongfully detained. The visits with the detainees did not seem like they were rushed, the official told CNN.\n\nThere was also a sense that the men appreciated getting to see the special envoy “because without an embassy there and the consular checkups that come when you have an embassy in country, they just don’t have that opportunity to tell part of their story and to let their loved ones know that someone saw them and they can report back, ‘Hey, I saw your husband, your brother, your father, and here’s how we looked and this is what he said,’” the official said. The US suspended operations at its embassy in Venezuela in March 2019.\n\nOne of the detained Americans, Heath, a US veteran who has been detained nearly two years on what the State Department calls “specious” charges, attempted suicide earlier this month.\n\nThe senior State Department official said that the delegation had been planning to make the trip to conduct “a health and welfare visit” for all of the detained Americans prior to Heath’s suicide attempt, but concern about his welfare lent urgency to having the visit this week, and that concern was highlighted in discussions with Venezuelan officials.\n\nHeath’s aunt Trudy Rutherford said in a statement Thursday they “believe that Matthew’s physical and mental health both continue to be at risk and are fearful he may attempt suicide again.”\n\n“While we are incredibly grateful for Ambassador Carstens and his team for having made this trip, it is important that there be continued, high level engagement between the U.S. Government centered around bringing Matthew and the other American detainees home,” she said.\n\n“President Biden and President Maduro both stand to benefit from ending the ordeal for all of these Americans and their families and neither benefits from their prolonged detention,” Rutherford said.\n\nThe family of Vadell, one of the “CITGO 6” who has been imprisoned since 2017, said in a statement that they “are beyond disappointed to see another plane land in the United States without Tomeu on it.”\n\n“For over four and a half years, this innocent man’s human rights have been violated,” the family said. “It’s unacceptable.”\n\nThe Vadell family called on “all stakeholders,” including the US government, Venezuelan authorities, CITGO and the United Nations, to work to secure his immediate release, noting he is almost 63 years old and “coping with heart issues and latent tuberculosis.”\n\n“His health and safety are our highest priority,” they said. “We need everyone involved to act with urgency, because every day matters.”\n\nTwo Americans who had been detained in Venezuela, including one of the CITGO 6, were released in March following the visit of two top US government officials to Caracas.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/politics/biden-griner-release-russia-geopolitics/index.html", "title": "Biden chose humanity over geopolitics with Griner release | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSwapping an American jailed for a minor drugs offense in Russia for one of the world’s most notorious arms traffickers known as “The Merchant of Death” might seem like a lopsided deal that could fuel dangerous national security precedents.\n\nBut President Joe Biden’s decision to exchange WNBA star Brittney Griner for Viktor Bout goes beyond the exchange’s bottom line. It represented a humane resolution to a painful dilemma that came after tortuous talks with a Russian regime that treats people as geopolitical pawns every day. In that sense, the Biden administration demonstrated the gulf between its moral grounding and that of Russian President Vladimir Putin who is currently demonstrating his inhumanity on another front, with a fearsome assault on Ukrainian civilians.\n\nBut the tragic counterpoint to this diplomatic triumph – Biden’s failure to also secure the release of Paul Whelan, another American incarcerated in a Russian penal colony – underscored the unforgiving moral conundrum he faced. And it prompted top Republicans to charge that he had prioritized a basketball superstar over an ex-marine who benefited from a vocal political pressure campaign on Biden.\n\nThe grave risks of the prisoner swap\n\nThere is no getting around the potential implications of the steps that Biden took, which followed earlier prisoner swaps with US adversaries conducted by his administration – including for an American and former US marine detained in Russia, Trevor Reed – and those of former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. There is now a considerable risk that other rogue nations or groups see Washington as open for business and may therefore see Americans abroad as increasingly valuable targets in a vicious cycle of more detentions.\n\nFurthermore, the return of Bout, who has been linked to Russian security services, handed Putin a propaganda coup at a time of rising domestic pressure. It enabled him to demonstrate to intelligence operatives engaged in nefarious activity abroad that they will not be forgotten by the Kremlin. Those intelligence services are critical to the Russian leader’s continued hold on power as his war in Ukraine deteriorates even further. Still, Biden’s strategy also hinted at intriguing diplomatic possibilities, three days after he refused to rule out future talks with Putin, if Ukraine’s agrees, aimed at ending the vicious war. He showed it was possible to deal with Russia, even amid an effective proxy war between the two old Cold War foes in Ukraine amid the worst relations between Moscow and Washington since the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nAnother notable cog in this deal was Saudi Arabia, which helped facilitate the exchange alongside the United Arab Emirates – and also helped secure the release of US citizens captured fighting in Ukraine earlier this year. Whether the kingdom, which has relations with both Moscow and Washington and is seeking to increase its global leadership role, might emerge as a mediator over Ukraine remains to be seen. But its recent smoothing of US-Russia exchanges might put Biden’s decision to travel to the country earlier this year and greet its ruthless Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with a fist bump, in a slightly different light.\n\nUltimately, it’s impossible for there not to be a sour aftertaste when dealing with an adversary as inhumane as Putin. But it is the job of a president to weigh these competing dynamics within the context of America’s national goals and duty to its citizens.\n\nIn cases like these, there is never a right answer.\n\nBiden under pressure to free another American\n\nThe most immediate question now facing Biden is how to extract Whelan, whose hopes were raised and then smashed, as he remained in prison and Griner went home, after both Americans were at the center of US-Russia diplomacy.\n\n“This is a precarious situation that needs to be resolved quickly,” a deeply disappointed Whelan told CNN’s State Department producer Jennifer Hansler in an exclusive phone interview. “I would hope that (Biden) and his administration would do everything they could to get me home, regardless of the price they might have to pay at this point.”\n\nThe harsh truth for Whelan is that Russia refused every inducement the US could offer to include him in an exchange package, leaving Biden’s capacity to free him in short order in doubt.\n\nRussian officials told the US side that a one-for-two swap was not acceptable but resisted wider options, US officials said.\n\nJohn Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, told CNN that the Kremlin regarded Whelan in a different light than Griner, since he’s facing espionage charges – even though the US says such allegations are a sham. This added dimension to Whelan’s incarceration will fuel speculation that Moscow may leverage him as it seeks a three-way deal with Germany to free a former colonel from its domestic spy agency who was convicted of murder last year. CNN reported in August that Russia had requested Vadim Krasikov be included in a deal for the two Americans.\n\nThis adds another layer of complication for Biden as he seeks to get Whelan free, since it involves another government and would require German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to potentially agree to supersede his country’s own legal system. Whether the new German leader has the political capacity to do so is unclear, as is the kind of Russian concession Berlin might require.\n\nA senior administration official said on Thursday evening that there is a recognition in the White House that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians so far, CNN reported.\n\nWhile Biden is being castigated by some political opponents in Washington for doing a bad deal, administration officials insisted that he got the best one on offer.\n\n“I want to be very clear – this was not a situation where we had a choice of which American to bring home. It was a choice between bringing home one particular American, Brittney Griner, or bringing home none,” a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told CNN she thought Putin was never going to hand over Whelan and all along wanted to swap only Griner for Bout.\n\n“It’s happening now because Vladimir Putin wants this to happen now, he needs a win, he needs a victory in Russia because he is having trouble convincing the Russia people that it’s a good idea to be at war with Ukraine,” Farkas said.\n\nShe added that there remained some hope for Whelan because the Griner exchange did show that “the Russians will make a deal if they think it’s in their interests.”\n\nWhelan isn’t the only American imprisoned in Russia. The family of US teacher Marc Fogel, who is serving a 14 year sentence at a hard labor camp, has also called for the White House to negotiate his release. Fogel was arrested last year in Moscow after traveling into the country with cannabis that his lawyer said was used for medical purposes.\n\nA political controversy erupts over Griner release\n\nThe fierce political divides that now challenge every US foreign policy decision did not take long to bubble over after Griner was freed – alongside a more vicious reaction on social media as some conservatives questioned her patriotism.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was relieved Griner was free but raised questions about the wisdom of such exchanges and whether they could endanger other Americans.\n\n“I think the challenge this points to is these regimes know this. This is why (President Nicolas) Maduro traded five Citgo executives – who were lured to Venezuela to get arrested – for his nephews who are convicted drug traffickers,” Rubio said.\n\n“That’s why you trade a professional basketball player with CBD oil for the Merchant of Death. These are bad trades,” he said.\n\nAnother Republican, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida described the deal to free Griner in a Twitter post as “shameful” and accused the administration of “giving priority to a celebrity over a veteran.”\n\nIn a later interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Waltz said: “This is a tactical victory, I am glad she is coming home. But this is a strategic loss.”\n\n“The reason the Iranian regime, the Taliban, Putin himself, continue to take Americans hostage is we continue to make concessions. When do we start dictating the terms to these regimes?”\n\nWhelan’s family reacted with great dignity in welcoming Griner’s release, despite their devastation that their brother did not come home. Elizabeth Whelan, Paul’s sister, called for political unity over the fate of hostages abroad, saying that hostile foreign countries are trying to use such cases to stir dissent in the US.\n\nWhelan also urged people to understand the human angle of Biden’s dilemma despite the grave geopolitical issues at stake.\n\n“It’s an amazing thing to be able to get Brittney back. It’s a win for us,” she said.\n\n“We tend to always look at what is Russia getting out of this? … We are getting a wrongfully detained American back home. It’s something to celebrate.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/10/brittney-griner-exchanged-viktor-bout-history-prisoner-swaps/10865122002/", "title": "Griner exchanged for Viktor Bout: One in a history of prisoner swaps", "text": "After the two prisoners walked past each other on the airport tarmac in Abu Dhabi – American basketball star Brittney Griner and Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \"Merchant of Death\" – this week's high-stakes exchange between the U.S. and Russia was finally complete.\n\nThat tense moment came just eight months after the Biden Administration swapped Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and drug smuggler, for ex-U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who had been held in Russia on espionage charges since 2018.\n\nBoth became part of a history of delicate and difficult prisoner swaps with Russia, Iran and other adversarial nations. Such swaps, including the one for Griner, have been deeply controversial, yet the tradition in the modern era stretches back to the return of a downed U-2 spy plane pilot in 1962.\n\nMore:Prisoner swap negotiations were 'painstaking, extraordinary'\n\nExperts say each case is unique and often requires intricate negotiations and difficult choices.\n\n“Often, the price we pay for bringing our fellow Americans home to their families is unseemly, but it is the right thing to do,” Bill Richardson, a former United Nations ambassador who has helped secure the release of U.S. detainees in Cuba, North Korea and elsewhere, said in a statement.\n\nMore:A complete timeline leading up to WNBA star's release\n\nHow do prisoner swaps work?\n\nPrisoner exchanges have occurred throughout history with soldiers captured during war.\n\nBut peacetime swaps of civilians, like the one involving Griner, are far less predictable.\n\nThey may involve Americans held hostage by terrorist groups or U.S. residents deemed to have been wrongly detained under foreign criminal charges.\n\nDetainees, such as two U.S. veterans captured while volunteering in Ukraine this year, are viewed as bargaining chips, according to Melvyn Levitsky, a professor of international policy at the University of Michigan and a retired U.S. ambassador.\n\nMore:Americans held captive by Russian separatists in Ukraine have returned to the US\n\nThe U.S. State Department's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs handles cases of Americans who are kidnapped and those the U.S. considers to be detained wrongfully or unlawfully overseas, Danielle Gilbert, Dartmouth College professor and top expert on international hostage situations, told USA TODAY.\n\nAlso helping is a coordinated response team of diplomats, intelligence agents and law enforcement officials. That team was put in place beginning after prisoners including journalist James Foley and others died as captives of the Islamic State. In that case and others, relatives of detained Americans had complained that American policies prevented them from effectively working to free their loved ones.\n\nMore:An American is detained or goes missing abroad. What happens next?\n\nIndependent negotiators or well-connected intermediaries can also work on behalf of the captured Americans.\n\nFor example, Richardson's nonprofit agency, the Richardson Center, has worked to win the release of detainees including several Americans held by Colombia’s Revolutionary Armed Forces and the 2009 release of a U.S. journalist sentenced to prison in North Korea.\n\nUltimately, the State Department and White House often make the decisions about the trades, Levitsky said.\n\n“It depends upon what country we’re dealing with and what that relationship looks like. There’s not a cookie-cutter solution,” he said.\n\nHow common are prisoner swaps today?\n\nGilbert said situations where the U.S. is trying to free an American from wrongful criminal detention by a nation, rather than a terrorist group, have increased since 2015.\n\n“The phenomenon is growing,” she said, estimating there are now a handful of prisoner exchanges each year.\n\nFormer President Trump made several high-profile efforts to free Americans. In 2019, for example, Trump publicly pushed Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson.\n\nThat same year, the State Department said it had helped release more than 180 Americans since 2015.\n\nToday there are 60 U.S. nationals and U.S. lawful permanent residents held in publicly disclosed hostage and wrongful detention cases in 18 countries including Russia, Iran, China, Venezuela and Mali, according to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation.\n\nAmong them is Paul Whelan, an ex-Marine from Michigan, arrested in Moscow in 2018 and accused of spying for the U.S. government. His family has said he was a security director for an automotive-parts company and was in Russia for a wedding.\n\nExperts said that while Russia refused to include Whelan in the swap for Bout, the publicity surrounding the case may increase pressure and efforts to win his release through some kind of exchange.\n\nWhat are some notable prisoner exchanges?\n\nOne of the best-known happened in 1962, a swap later portrayed in the Steven Spielberg Cold War movie “Bridge of Spies.”\n\nIn that case, the U.S. won the release of U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers, who was shot down and captured by the Soviet Union, in exchange for Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, a Soviet intelligence officer.\n\nOther Cold War exchanges included trading U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, then a Moscow-based reporter for U.S. News & World Report, for Gennadi Zakharov, the Soviet employee of the United Nations arrested for allegedly handing over money to a contact for classified U.S. Air Force documents.\n\nMore recently, in 2014 during the war in Afghanistan, the Obama administration released five Taliban prisoners for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban after leaving his base.\n\nTwo years later, in the context of the U.S.- Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. won the release of journalist Jason Rezaian, imprisoned on espionage-related charges, in exchange for Iranians who had been charged with violating U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn September, two American veterans held captive by Russian separatists in Ukraine since June returned after a Saudi-brokered swap with Russian-backed separatists that included eight other prisoners from four countries.\n\nAre prisoner swaps controversial?\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in July said the U.S. had made a \"substantial offer\" in exchange for the Griner and Whelan.\n\nBut White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and senior administration officials said this week that Russia would not engage in good faith negotiations for Whelan.\n\n\"It was either Brittney or no one at all,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nSome critics have argued that Bout’s crimes are mismatched with Griner’s alleged crimes – possessing cannabis vape cartridges. Bout, 55, a former Soviet military officer, was serving a 25-year prison sentence for conspiring to kill Americans, acquiring and exporting anti-aircraft missiles, and providing material support to a terrorist organization. Bout claimed he was innocent.\n\nGilbert said while Bout is very prominent, others traded by the U.S. in exchanges have been convicted of crimes such as violating sanctions against other nations or involvement in cybercrimes.\n\nSome also argue that exchanging prisoners could encourage other countries to detain Americans, she said. While it’s not clear yet that’s happened, she said, “that’s a live debate, and I think that’s a legitimate concern.\"\n\nTulane University political science professor Chris Fettweis said in a statement that – despite the criticism by some – he believes Griner's release was a positive outcome.\n\n“Griner was a political prisoner. We got her home. It’s a good day, no matter how much some people want to inject some moral ambiguity into it,” Fettweis said.\n\nChris Kenning is a national reporter.

An order issued Monday by Gov. Kay Ivey allows the Bureau of Pardons and Paroles to hold hearings for inmates seeking early release without in-person participation from the public. The three-member board could meet by telephone or over the internet. Hearings will resume the week of May 18, and crime victims and others can submit comments in writing, Charlie Graddick, the director of the agency, said in a statement. People who can’t write can call. The agency had suspended hearings at its offices in Montgomery because of the pandemic and social distancing guidelines. Some had complained that the moratorium could lead to an increase in the state’s overcrowded prison system and present health risks for inmates at risk of contracting the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Leaders of a tribal village have voted to adopt stringent measures to limit an upswing in the illegal transport of drugs and alcohol amid fears that the smuggled goods could prompt a surge in coronavirus infections. The Kwethluk Tribal Council tried to limit travel in and out of the village to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, but the measures resulted in increased alcohol and drugs smuggled into the community where alcohol sales are prohibited, KYUK-AM reported Monday. The tribal council is worried the boxes and bottles smuggled into the village might spread the coronavirus, Kwethluk said Boris Epchook, commander for the Tribal Incident Management Team. The new penalties include fines of $1,000 and confiscations of snowmobiles or other vehicles used to transport alcohol and drugs. The tribe also plans to fine people traveling in and out of the village without authorization and for traveling during the village curfew hours of midnight to 6 a.m. Fines will increase by $1,000 with each additional infraction and confiscated vehicles will not be released until after the pandemic ends, the council said. The vehicles also will become available for use by the incident command team, the village security team and the Kwethluk Police Department personnel for enforcement work.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Arizona processed a record 82,771 background checks on would-be gun buyers in March, as fears of the coronavirus drove people to gun shops in what one shop owner called “panic time.” It was twice as high as any March in the state since FBI background checks began in 1998 and almost one-quarter of the total sales in Arizona for all of 2019, according to NICS Firearm Checks data, which showed a doubling of background checks from February. Gun shop owners said the only thing that has slowed down sales is a lack of inventory after March’s surge. The surge was reflected nationally, with background checks in March exceeding 3.7 million, a record for one month and more than a million higher than the 2.6 million checks in March 2019. Gun shop owners blamed the increase, especially for first-time buyers, on fears that police agency ranks might be thinned by coronavirus infections, as well as worries that gun shops might shut down along with other businesses. There’s no danger of that for now in Arizona, where Gov. Doug Ducey declared gun shops an “essential service” in his March 23 executive order that shut down many other nonessential businesses.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A wind turbine manufacturing plant in Little Rock is closing, affecting about 470 workers, the facility’s parent company said Tuesday. GE Renewable Energy said it was closing the LM Wind Power Plant because of declining demand for the specific blades made at the facility and the company’s need to streamline operations. The company said it is offering additional support for the plant’s employees, including continued pay for a minimum of four months and paying their health insurance premiums for another six months. LM Wind Power announced its $150 million facility in Little Rock in 2007 and opened it the following year. GE Renewable Energy acquired the company in 2016. Arkansas lured the company to the state with tax breaks and nearly $17 million in economic development incentives.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs:The city on Monday issued an order that mandates all workers and visitors wear face masks, similar to Riverside County’s face-covering order that was issued earlier this month. Mayor Geoff Kors said although the majority of people are wearing protective coverings when they leave the house, not all are complying with the directive that’s meant to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. “We’re almost at the end of our second 14-day incubation period, and we’re continuing to have community spread,” he said. “If everyone was following the rules, those numbers would be lower, and we’d get through this faster.” Face coverings can include fabric masks, bandanas or scarfs without holes, or neck gaiters. City code enforcement and peace officers who enforce the order can issue fines for violations based on the severity, according to the order. Under the Palm Springs order, businesses also will have to post signs that remind people of the rule to wear a mask before they can enter a business. Kors said the city wanted to pass its own order after Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said last week that people will not be stopped and ticketed because they’re not wearing a mask. In Palm Springs, there’s a legal range for fines, and a general infraction usually starts around $100. Kors said although the city’s goal is to get people to comply with the order, businesses who are repeat offenders could see higher amounts or a suspension of their business license.\n\nColorado\n\nWindsor:Fort Range Fire Chief Mike West has turned to playing the bagpipe as a nightly rallying cry to ward off coronavirus blues. If you happen to be strolling along the peaceful Poudre Trail near Eastman Park, you are likely to hear his soulful melody. “This is a way of telling our friends and neighbors we are still here for another day,” West said. “It says we put up another good day of fight, and we are ready to put up another day of fight tomorrow.” West belongs to the 75-member Colorado Emerald Society, a band of Irish police officers and firefighters from 24 agencies across Colorado. He and other members of the society’s bagpiper ranks borrowed the idea from another band to head to different destinations near their homes and play for the last 20 to 30 minutes before sunset. He said the COVID-19 pandemic broke up the band for now, so instead of practicing together, members practice the same songs on their sunset tributes with the hopes that they will be ready to play together when the pandemic passes. West said members started playing March 29 and will play “until a reputable source tells them the coronavirus curve has flattened and the virus is under control.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Officials in the state’s largest city are seeking quick testing for the coronavirus for police and firefighters amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. Mayor Joe Ganim said the city is working with the state Department of Public Health to secure serological blood tests, which detect antibodies for the new coronavirus and produce results in as few as 10 minutes. Eleven police department personnel and 22 fire department employees are in quarantine because of potential exposure to the virus, Ganim said. The tests would eliminate the need to quarantine first responders for 14 days, he said. From Friday to Monday, the city of nearly 145,000 people has seen COVID-19 cases increase about 40% to 786 and deaths more than double to 23. The city now has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the state after Stamford, which is approaching 1,500 cases. Ganim said the increase in cases was expected because of Bridgeport’s proximity to New York City, about 60 miles away.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro:Chicken producer Allen Harim Foods said the coronavirus outbreak has hit its staffing levels so hard that it cannot keep up with production. That means about 2 million chickens owned by the company be killed at the Delaware and Maryland farms where they were raised, but their meat will not make it to market, according to the Delmarva Poultry Industry. That announcement caught the attention of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is calling for Allen Harim to kill the chickens humanely. Allen Harim officials have not responded to requests for information about how they’re handling the coronavirus outbreak, or about their need to reduce flock numbers. “The impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. chicken industry is becoming more apparent as the disease continues to spread throughout the United States,” said Delaware Poultry Industry Executive Director Holly Porter. That includes Delmarva, where processing plants are seeing reduced staffing because of illness and absences from those concerned about COVID-19, she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Washington National Cathedral wanted to honor the men and women who are risking their lives every day to help the community in the fight to end the spread of the new coronavirus. So, it came as no surprise that they lit things up in blue with “Thank You” projected across the front of the cathedral, WUSA-TV reported. In conjunction with Atmosphere Lighting, the lighting starts at 8 p.m. every night this week through Friday. Buildings at the National Harbor, the Capital Wheel and Fleet Street are also lit up in blue to show solidarity with communities around the world. You can catch the lights driving across the bridge, on the property and on social media using #LightItBlue or #NationalHarbor. “The initiative is a way to say thank you to all of those fighting COVID-19 on the front lines,” said Jackie Saunders, AVP of marketing at National Harbor. “This effort is part of a massive ‘thank you’ to all of the healthcare professionals, first responders and essential workers who are risking their own health to save lives.” The National Harbor lighting coincides with communities clapping from their homes, windows and balconies at the same time to show their appreciation for healthcare and essential workers around the world.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A judge has one request for attorneys showing up for court hearings via Zoom: Get out of bed and put on some clothes! Broward Circuit Judge Dennis Bailey made the plea in a letter published by the Weston Bar Association, news outlets reported. “It is remarkable how many ATTORNEYS appear inappropriately on camera,” Bailey said in the letter. “One male lawyer appeared shirtless and one female attorney appeared still in bed, still under the covers.” Bailey isn’t making any exceptions for lawyers lounging in the sunshine, either. “Putting on a beach cover-up won’t cover up you’re poolside in a bathing suit,” he wrote. Since courthouses shut down on March 16 to help slow the coronavirus pandemic, Broward County’s judicial system has held about 1,200 Zoom meetings involving some 14,000 participants, WPLG-TV reported. Bailey said he won’t hold a complicated trial over the video conferencing site, given the technology’s shortcomings. “Often, lawyers are not looking at their screens but down at their files, their outlines and notes, or simply out the window, and cannot see the judge is hollering “Stop! Stop!” because an objection has been made and the audio stays with the witness rather than obeying the judge,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Police are seeking a woman they said coughed on a family in what investigators believe might have been part of a social media challenge. A family with four children was exercising outside at the Atlantic Station mixed-use development on April 5 when a woman approached on foot and coughed on them, Officer Anthony Grant said in an email Tuesday. The woman, who was holding her phone, said, “Corona,” and laughed, before walking away, he wrote. Investigators said the woman might have been participating in a coronavirus social media challenge. Police released a link to a video they said shows the woman they’re looking for. Police would like to speak with the woman about the incident and are asking anyone with information about her identity to call Crime Stoppers.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hawaii has experienced a significant reduction in the use of electricity because of the coronavirus, with Maui’s use dropping the most among the three largest islands. Hawaiian Electric said the reduction is linked to a decline in tourism activities, business closures and residents staying home to slow the spread of the virus, The Maui News reported Monday. Maui had a 14% decline in average system peak demand, the point of highest energy use, during the week of March 22, the utility said. On Oahu and Hawaii island, the decline was by 7%, the company said. The change came after Democratic Gov. David Ige issued a stay-at-home order March 23 and then imposed a quarantine on visitors. The reduction in daytime peak electricity demand on Maui and Oahu came as schools, offices, government buildings, hotels and businesses closed. Peak daytime demand fell 21% on Maui and 16% on Oahu after March 22, Hawaiian Electric said. Maui experienced record lows for daytime electricity generation on sunny days when private rooftop solar systems supplied the majority of energy, the company said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has enough gowns, face shields, gloves and other medical supplies to last for two weeks in dealing with the coronavirus crisis and that more supplies are on the way, officials said Tuesday. Republican Gov. Brad Little visited a Boise site where state officials are receiving and distributing medical supplies from donors, the federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile and state procurement efforts. “The protection of our healthcare workers is a big part of preserving healthcare capacity, and ample personal protective equipment keeps them healthy and safe,” Little said in a statement. He also said in a video released by his office of the tour that the state must do more testing for the virus and that more personal protective equipment for healthcare workers is needed to boost that effort. Little said his March 25 statewide stay-at-home order is working to slow the spread of the virus. The order expires late Wednesday and Little is scheduled to hold a news conference Wednesday morning about the order. He has not said whether the order will be extended, but has previously said he does not expect life to get back to normal in Idaho until there is a vaccine or a effective treatment for the virus.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The COVID-19 Donations Center, a joint effort of the Winnebago County Emergency Operations Center and Salvation Army, opened Tuesday at 5460 E. State St. in Rockford, the Rockford Register Star reported. The center will be accepting donations from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays. Area residents are being instructed to only bring items that are listed and to only bring them during the designated drop-off times. Items being collected for the general public in need are: paper products (paper towels, napkins and paper plates), personal hygiene items (shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, razors, lotion and body wash), baby care items (diapers, baby wipes, baby blankets, baby bottles and formula), cleaning supplies, laundry supplies and homemade face masks. Personal protective equipment for first responders and health care workers include N95 masks (NIOSH approved), procedure masks (ASTM II or III), isolation gowns, exam gloves (nitrile or vinyl), eye protection (glasses or goggles), face shields, hand wipes, TYVEK suits, sanitizing wipes, sanitizing sprays, anti-microbial hand soap, hand sanitizer, biohazard bags, gallons of bleach, touch-free thermometers and show covers. PPE donations will be distributed to local health care facilities. Items donated for the general public will be distributed to agencies serving area families and individuals in need. Volunteers wearing masks and gloves will retrieve donations from vehicles as they arrive at the center.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana residents are applying for unemployment benefits with every passing week of the coronavirus pandemic at a rate more than double the highest levels of claims filed during the Great Recession. That’s a significant strain on Indiana’s pool of money reserved for unemployment payments, which in January stood at $895 million. It’s unknown how long that money, which averages roughly $300 per person of the maximum $390, will last. But experts said it’s likely, if not certain, that the money will run out. When that happens, the state must borrow money from the federal government in the form of Title XII loans, just as Indiana and other states did during the Great Recession. It’s a process that once again adds debt to Indiana’s unemployment insurance fund, which had one of the lowest ratings in the nation for financial stability before the pandemic crisis. The state finally finished paying off federal debt from the Great Recession in 2015. Unemployment claims have skyrocketed in the past three weeks, as the economy reeled from Gov. Eric Holcomb’s first stay-at-home order that took effect on March 25. New claims have shot up to a high of 139,174 for the week ending March 28, and another 133,639 filed initial claims the next week. In the first few days of April alone, the department made 175,195 benefit payments, more than twice the 71,000 payments it made in the entire month of April last year.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Facing a 95% reduction in passenger traffic, Des Moines International Airport officials have closed a terminal, shut down services and delayed projects – including a planned Allegiant Air crew base – to save money during the coronavirus pandemic. The unprecedented decrease in travelers while Iowans are practicing social distancing follows three years of record-breaking traffic at the state’s largest airport. Officials said Des Moines International is in a good place financially, but the future of the airport industry once the pandemic subsides is unknown. “No one knows for sure what this industry is going to look like once we get past this,” Kevin Foley, the airport’s executive director, said at a virtual board meeting Tuesday. He and global airport officials expect the industry to enter a recession post-pandemic as they face a $252 billion passenger revenue loss and 2 million flight cancellations in 2020, according to the International Air Transport Association. Experts agree that international flights will be the slowest to start back up and passengers might still be hesitant to travel domestically for quite some time, Foley told the board. Des Moines International’s drop in passenger traffic began March 12, the same day the growing coronavirus pandemic prompted the closure of Walt Disney World and the cancellation of trips by Princess Cruises. It saw a 44% year-over-year decrease in March.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Health officials are urging store employees to cover their faces with masks or scarves at all times amid the coronavirus outbreak. Shawnee County health officer Gianfranco Pezzino also wrote Monday that retailers should limit the number of customers in a store at one time to no more than five customers for each 1000 square feet. He said that customers should be admitted on a “one-out, one in” basis once a store reaches its capacity, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. He also said that shopping carts should be sanitized before they are touched by customers and that hand sanitizer should be readily available. He also said the floor should be marked near cash registers to indicate where customers should stand.\n\nKentucky\n\nBenton:The trial of a teen accused of fatally shooting two classmates and wounding 14 others at a high school might be postponed because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Prosecutors and defense attorneys cited the virus in a Skype hearing on Monday as a reason to delay the trial of Gabriel Parker, 18, who is charged in the January 2018 shooting at Marshall County High School, news outlets reported. The trial for Parker, who was charged as an adult, is set to begin on June 1. Prosecutor Dennis Foust and defense attorney Tom Griffiths both expressed concerns about getting out-of-state witnesses to the trial. There also is a moratorium on most jury trials in Kentucky. Another issue discussed was how officials would accomplish social distancing during the proceedings, though different orders could be in place by June 1, the parties agreed. Marshall Circuit Judge Jamie Jameson said he would rule after getting more guidance from the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:The Lafayette Regional Airport is receiving nearly $3 million in supplemental Airport Improvement Program funding as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins said Tuesday. The Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia is also receiving $30,000. “Coronavirus-related travel and economic restrictions have greatly injured our local airports as well as our larger economy,” Higgins said. “This funding will help offset some of those losses and ensure our local airports can maintain essential operations. Further, we’re working to deliver financial relief to individual Americans and businesses across the spectrum. This effort is ongoing.” The Lafayette Regional Airport is building a new terminal, with the total costs of the project being about $145 million. Much of the funding for the project is coming from federal and state agencies, though some is coming from a fee assessed to passengers. Passengers were also paying for the second security line the airport announced late last year. But passenger numbers dropped sharply in March, with the month seeing the airport’s lowest marks for outgoing and incoming passengers for the last decade. In March, the airport had almost 9,300 outgoing passengers – a decrease of nearly 57% from March 2019. The previous low was about 16,600 in 2016. There were about 10,500 incoming passengers in March, down about 51% from March 2019. The previous low was about 16,700 in 2016. The airport is coming off a record year, when it saw more than 267,000 outgoing passengers and more than 260,000 incoming passengers in 2019.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Health officials have been given high marks from the public for their response to the coronavirus pandemic, but the state lags behind others in the region in reporting some key pieces of data. Maine is the only New England state unable to provide daily reports on the number of people who have been tested for the virus, the Portland Press Herald reported Tuesday. And the state disclosed the number of nonresident COVID-19 cases only once, on April 9, even though Maine has the highest proportion of vacation homes in the nation. Two other states with large numbers of seasonal residents – Hawaii and Florida – post information on nonresident cases daily, the newspaper reported. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Robert Long said part of the problem with the lack of daily testing numbers is that outside labs are conducting tests, making it harder to get a handle on the figure. Because of “the varying frequency and formats that outside labs use in submitting negative test results,” the agency had decided that weekly reporting “ensures the reliability and accuracy of these data,” he told the newspaper in an email.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state elections board decided Monday to allow three in-person voting centers for the special general election later this month to fill the rest of term for the seat last held by the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings. The board voted Monday to allow one in-person voting center in each of the congressional district’s three jurisdictions on the day of the April 28 election. Those include the city of Baltimore, as well as Baltimore and Howard counties. The board is urging voters to cast their ballots by mail and leave the in-person centers for people who cannot vote by mail – such as the disabled and homeless – to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. Initially, the election was going to be held entirely by mail. Ballots were mailed to all eligible active voters in early April with a return envelope and prepaid postage, the board said. Democrat Kweisi Mfume is running against Republican Kimberly Klacik in the special general election. The winner will still need to run in the state’s June 2 primary to win the party nomination to seek a full term to the seat in November’s election. Meanwhile,\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston-area transit system is projecting a $231 million budget deficit for the fiscal year that ends June 30 caused in large part by a more than 90% decline in ridership during the coronavirus crisis. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officials estimated a fare revenue plunge from $58 million per month to about $3 million per month for the next three to four months. The MBTA should be eligible for about $840 million in federal stimulus funds, chief financial officer Mary Ann O’Hara said Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state will offer cash-strapped bars and restaurants relief by buying back their liquor inventory during the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an order authorizing the program in a flurry of moves late Monday. She also delayed the expiration of valid driver’s licenses and state ID cards to June 30. And she extended a measure to keep intact a prohibition against dine-in service at restaurants and to continue the closure of many places of public accommodation through April 30 – when her stay-at-home order is scheduled to expire. Michigan’s 8,500 on-premises liquor licensees will have until Friday to request that the Liquor Control Commission buy back spirits purchased before March 16. Participating businesses are expected to keep their bottles for now to limit the risk of COVID-19 spreading. Licensees will be able to buy the liquor again for at least 90 days after the states of emergency and disaster end. Whitmer said the program will help bars and restaurants “weather the storm through this challenging time in our history.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Department of Natural Resources has canceled this year’s egg-taking for walleye, northern pike, muskies and steelhead because of concerns over spreading the coronavirus. The agency said the work cannot be done safely under social distancing guidelines. According to the DNR, collecting eggs and sperm from spawning fish in the wild is labor-intensive and requires teams of six to eight people working in close proximity. The DNR looked at whether egg-taking could be reengineered, but determined it was not possible to safely handle fish during the egg take and protect staff from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The DNR collects fish eggs each spring to stock Minnesota waters that have low or no natural reproduction of those species. The agency said missing one year won’t hurt the fish population.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman inmate who died tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Department of Corrections. The unidentified man is the first reported inmate in the state prison system to test positive for the virus. MDOC issued a statement Monday night about the inmate, but didn’t provide details on when he died. Interim MDOC Commissioner Tommy Taylor told the Clarion Ledger on Monday night that he was informed Sunday of the inmate’s death. He said the inmate died at Delta Regional Medical Center in Greenville. He said the inmate had been sick for weeks. Last week, MDOC announced three employees tested positive for COVID-19. The MDOC statement said the inmate, who had underlying health conditions, was tested when he began exhibiting symptoms and was immediately medically isolated pending results. The results did not come in until after the inmate had died. Whether the inmate died because of the coronavirus has not been determined, according to Taylor.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state has begun issuing $600 payments to more than 115,000 unemployed workers using funds approved as part of the federal stimulus package aimed at bolstering the economy left reeling by the coronavirus crisis. The Missouri Division of Employment Security said Tuesday that claimants should see payments within the next few days. The state said payments that began Monday will amount to $66 million in benefits. The congressional rescue bill added $600 a week, for a period of four months, to standard unemployment benefits. Some recipients will have to wait. The state can’t yet process unemployment claims from independent contractors and the self-employed, even though the federal government has temporarily extended benefits to those workers, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Anna Hui, secretary of the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, said the computer system for processing claims isn’t set up to take in applications from people who don’t have a direct employer. It’s unclear when the system might be able to process those claims.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said he does not have a timeline for when things can return to normal in Montana after the coronavirus outbreak, but Republican legislative leaders said he should start moving moving in that direction because the state’s economy is in a free fall. Bullock answered questions from residents during a Monday afternoon telephone town hall, saying he will continue issuing his stay-at-home orders in two-week intervals based on advice from medical professionals. Indicators such as a decline in cases over a two-week period or increased testing capability, could lead to easing restrictions. Bullock said even if he lifts the stay-at-home order, he might discourage large groups from gathering to avoid additional virus outbreaks, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. Republican legislative leaders, including Senate President Scott Sales and House Speaker Greg Hertz, wrote to Bullock Tuesday complaining that he hurt private businesses because by arbitrarily deciding which businesses were essential and could stay open, but apparently has not furloughed any state employees. The lawmakers suggested allowing local school districts to decide to reopen and letting businesses in counties with no recent COVID-19 cases to reopen while keeping areas with high numbers of infected people such as Gallatin County under heavier restrictions. They also suggest following the example of states like Florida, by directing at-risk populations, such as senior citizens and those suffering from chronic health conditions, to stay home.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts on Monday rejected a call from two state lawmakers to resume normal school and business activities in Nebraska right away, saying that could lead to a surge in new cases that might overwhelm the state’s hospitals. Ricketts said he will stick with the state’s current plan, which includes statewide school closures and restrictions on businesses and social gatherings until at least April 30. His remarks at his daily coronavirus press briefing came in response to a question about a newspaper column by state Sens. Steve Halloran and Steve Erdman, both conservatives who usually agree with the Republican governor. The senators argued that shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. have devastated the economy, put students at a disadvantage and “made the cure worse than the disease.” The senators contend that lifting the restrictions and allowing healthy people to contract the virus would create a “herd immunity” that would protect society as a whole. Epidemiologists and other public health experts said that approach would lead to a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths, and social distancing is the only way to protect people who are most at risk. Ricketts said he agrees with the senators “100%” about the need to reopen schools and businesses as soon as possible, but he warned that doing so too soon could lead to a spike in cases.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Great Basin National Park has been closed to all park visitors in response to guidance from county health officials in Nevada amid the coronavirus pandemic. The National Park Service made the announcement Monday after White Pine County public health officials encouraged park officials to take action to fight the spread of the new coronavirus, the Elko Daily Free Press reported. “The health and safety of our visitors, employees, volunteers, and partners is our number one priority,” the statement said. “The National Park Service is working servicewide with federal, state, and local authorities to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.” The park spans more than 120,500 square miles and is known for its ancient bristlecone pine grove and the Lehman caves. The park’s highest elevation is 13,063 feet at Wheeler Peak. Park officials are expected to notify the public when operations resume. Visitors have been encouraged to explore the park through digital tools already made available online until the park reopens.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Prouty, an annual New Hampshire event to raise money for cancer research that involves people biking, walking, and doing other activities together, is going virtual this year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Organizers said the Prouty will not be bringing 4,000 people together in Hanover in July for what traditionally has been a two-day event. Instead, participants will be encouraged to take part between June 1 and July 11 to bike, walk, row, golf, or do any other event from home or outdoors, allowing for physical distancing. Organizers have waived fundraising minimums except for the Prouty Ultimate bike riding event, which has lowered amounts. This is the 39th year of the Prouty, which supports cancer research and patient services at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center in Lebanon and in other locations across the state and in Vermont. The event has raised more than $40 million. More information is available at www.TheProuty.org, under “New for Prouty 2020.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi and at least a dozen other New Jersey natives will be doing a COVID-19 fundraiser for vulnerable victims in the state later this month, a relief fund announced Tuesday. The New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund said the singers and celebrities will appear in videos from their homes at 7 p.m. on April 22. The other stars include New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley, singer Tony Bennett, actors Danny DeVito and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as comedian Chris Rock. The celebrities will be directing people to the fund’s website so they can donate. The event will air on Apple Music and AppleTV apps, but will also be broadcast live and rebroadcast five times on E Street Radio on SiriusXM, according to the statement. The program will also be carried on WABC, WPVI, WPIX, News12, NJTV and radio outlets including 1010 WINS, WCBS 880 and others. The fund will provide grants to existing organizations that have a record of caring for vulnerable communities, according to the fund. All the money will go to groups that provide “essential services to those in need and to assist those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the fund’s statement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A church has filed a lawsuit against the state after houses of worship were removed from an exemption of a public health order limiting gatherings to no more than five people to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Legacy Church is seeking a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against the order prohibiting people from congregating at places of worship, citing it violates the church’s First Amendment rights, the Albuquerque Journal reported. Legacy Church is holding online services that require about 30 people in the building, including the pastor, the band and others Pastor Steve Smothermon said, but there is ample space to social distance in the 2,500-seat church. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the order Saturday, a day before Easter. The order only prohibits places from bringing together more than five people into a space where they are within 6 feet of one another, governor spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said. Attorneys for the church and the state Health Department indicated Monday in a phone meeting with U.S. District Judge James Browning that they would be willing to compromise.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s once-overwhelmed 911 system is now seeing a more normal volume of medical calls, a sign the crisis could be ebbing and people are heeding messages to call only in a life-threatening emergency. The fire department, which runs the city’s EMS system, said it received 3,932 calls requesting ambulances Sunday, down from a record high of 6,527 on March 30. The average volume in March and April of 2019 was just over 4,000 calls. Sunday was the sixth straight day that the city’s medical call volume was lower than the previous day. The fire department said it’s too early to know why volume has dropped. At the peak, operators were answering four new calls a minute. The fire department said the heavy volume of coronavirus patients had been pushing response times for the most serious calls to an average of more than 10 minutes, up from about 6½ to 7 minutes under typical circumstances.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nButner: An 81-year-old inmate at the Butner Prison Complex’s medium-security facility, has died after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Charles Richard Rootes died Saturday after receiving treatment for the virus for over two weeks, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a news release. He was diagnosed with the virus on March 26 after being taken to a hospital for respiratory failure. Roots was serving a 99-year sentence after being convicted last year of kidnapping, rape, and theft. As of Sunday, more than 80 people, including 22 employees, have been diagnosed with the virus in the prison complex that housed Rootes, The News & Observer reported. The facility, which houses 641 men, has more than 40 inmates who have tested positive for the virus. There are 10 other confirmed coronavirus cases among inmates at Butner’s low-security facility.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum stopped short of mandating that all polling places close during the state’s June 9 primary election, despite being urged by county auditors to do so out of concern for poll workers and the public amid the coronavirus outbreak. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor wanted to give counties the option of having open polling places. “The bottom line is the governor wanted to provide flexibility to the counties to decide if they wanted to do mail-ballot-only elections based on their individual circumstances,” Nowatzki said. Conducting elections safely amid the pandemic has become an issue nationwide, most notably last week in Wisconsin, where Republicans insisted on holding in-person voting despite widespread health fears. It’s not clear who has the authority to change the format of an election in North Dakota. And the state’s top two Republicans said they think the decision should be left to counties. Burgum, at the request of the North Dakota County Auditors Association, signed an executive order last month waiving the requirement that counties have at least one physical polling site for the June election, while allowing counties to conduct the primary election entirely by mail.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Three weeks into Ohio’s stay-at-home order, Gov. Mike DeWine is facing increasing pressure to restart some nonessential work across the state, especially in areas with few confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. Republicans from rural Ohio who are worried about an economic collapse and owners of small businesses who fear losing their life investments are calling on DeWine to relax social distancing restrictions that brought many workplaces to a standstill. Although the Republican governor’s administration is working on a plan to gradually get people back to work, DeWine made it clear Monday that protecting the state’s residents is his first priority. So far, Ohio has avoided massive outbreaks like ones that crippled Detroit, New York City and New Orleans. DeWine said he has been getting advice from all corners, including the White House. U.S. Rep. Stephanie Howse, a Democrat who represents parts of Cleveland’s east side, said it’s fine to begin talking about how to lift parts of Ohio’s stay-at-home order but too early to put that into motion. Those decisions should be made with input from public health officials who are relying on data, she said, noting there isn’t enough testing currently to know how widespread the virus has become, including in rural areas. “We’re all getting anxious,” Howse said. “It’s hard to stay still. But we need to stay still.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s health agencies no longer need approval before hiring additional employees after Gov. Kevin Stitt updated his executive order again on Monday in an effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the Oklahoman reported. Stitt also clarified the circumstances under which state-level first responders could take paid sick leave. First responders, who include correctional officers, law enforcement and fire personnel, have to be under a COVID-19 quarantine or isolation order or be experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus and seeking a medical diagnosis before they can get paid sick leave. The clarifications come about a week after Stitt made sure first responders would be guaranteed paid time off if they contracted COVID-19. “Our first responders put their lives on the line every day to protect their fellow Oklahomans,” Stitt said in a press release. “There’s no opportunity to work from home in these jobs, so they need our support. I also encourage cities and counties across the state to provide the same benefits to their first responders.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: More than 100 older and medically vulnerable homeless people have been provided hotel rooms to protect them from COVID-19 before the coronavirus pandemic spreads within Salem’s unsheltered population. Since mid-March, the Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency has placed 113 unsheltered homeless people in six hotels across Marion and Polk counties, paying for them to stay, delivering food to their doors and checking on them daily. Certain underlying medical maladies – including heart conditions, asthma, diabetes, liver or kidney disease, cancer and immune deficiencies –put people at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19, which makes it all the more important they limit contact with other people who might transmit the virus to them. For unsheltered homeless people, social distancing at home isn’t an option. So people with those conditions are being identified by ARCHES and moved indoors before they come into contact with the virus. There has been one confirmed case of the new coronavirus among Salem’s homeless community, which was identified in mid-March.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Counties across the state have processed about 283,000 absentee and mail-in ballots for the June primary, and requests from Democrats are three times more common than from Republicans, state elections officials said Tuesday. The Department of State said 89,000 absentee ballot requests have been processed, with the June 2 primary still seven weeks away. During the 2016 primary, 84,000 votes were cast under the absentee ballot system, which is available only to those who offer an acceptable reason they would not be able to vote in person. Counties have processed 195,000 requests for mail-in ballots under a state law passed last fall that permits them for any voter who requests one. Pennsylvania has about 4.1 million registered Democrats and 3.3 million Republicans. Of the absentee and mail-in requests for the primary processed so far, about 209,000 are from Democrats and 73,000 from Republicans. Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren said remote voting applications jumped after Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf issued orders closing schools and businesses not considered essential to sustaining life.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Republican Party has raised concerns about the suspension of elections laws for the state’s June 2 presidential primary in response to the coronavirus crisis. The party in a letter to the state Board of Elections on Tuesday said it was concerned about mail ballot fraud as a result of the suspension of laws requiring two people, or a notary, to witness the signing by voters of mail ballots. “Don’t suspend laws that safeguard our elections,? the party said. The GOP also questioned whether the expense of sending mail ballot applications to all of Rhode Island’s roughly 789,000 registered voters for what is likely to be a “low-turnout” contest is necessary. In response, election board Vice Chairman Stephen Erickson told The Providence Journal that the GOP’s concerns appear to be centered on “false claims of widespread fraud.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: With hurricane season less than two months away, state officials said Monday they don’t yet have a good plan in place if a storm hits during the coronavirus outbreak, particularly for people potentially displaced from their homes. During the latest media briefing on the outbreak, Kim Stenson, director of the state Emergency Management Division, said his agency is still working to configure solutions for how to potentially handle thousands of evacuees in an age of social distancing. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, although Stenson pointed out that the state typically isn’t impacted until later in the season. According to the National Weather Service, most hurricanes affecting South Carolina have historically occurred from August through October, but there have also been “fairly active” periods as early as May. The earliest hurricane to impact the area was recorded nearly 70 years ago, in February 1952. Forecasters also note a “general increasing trend” of hurricanes either before June or after October, possibly because of better observation and record-keeping. With social distancing guidelines in place, Stenson said, the issue of how to shelter those displaced during hurricanes is being discussed now by officials who annually come up with plans for each storm season. As it is during the coronavirus outbreak, Stenson’s agency acts as a statewide clearinghouse for coordination of emergency response during hurricanes, a centralized hub for the tracking of shelters and resources, as well as the dissemination of information to media and the public at large.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Falls Park Farmer’s Market is offering produce and products in an online market ahead of its usual May opening because of the coronavirus pandemic. Although the market hasn’t been approved as an “essential business” yet in Sioux Falls, vendors want to limit foot traffic if the market is able to have a physical location this year. Nathan Van Zweden, a market vendor and a member of the market’s board of directors, said he hopes the market will be included as an essential business. But the online shop will allow people to follow CDC recommendations while still supporting vendors, he said. Customers are able to order products online at 12 p.m. Monday through 5 p.m. Wednesday each week and pick up their orders in the Falls Park Farmer’s Market parking lot that Saturday. The market plans to offer a delivery option soon, Van Zweden said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Abortion providers have filed an emergency motion in federal court, asking for an order allowing them to continue serving women despite Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order aimed at slowing the spread of the new coronavirus. Their attorneys argued in a motion filed Monday that abortions should be exempt from the Republican governor’s order blocking “nonemergency health care procedures.” Delaying abortions will “impose extreme burdens” on women by forcing them to travel long distances out of state during the pandemic, or wait weeks for an abortion, exposing them to increased medical risks, they argued. It also runs counter to guidance from the American Medical Association, which issued a statement “denouncing efforts to ‘ban or dramatically limit women’s reproductive health care’ at this time,” court filings stated. Applying the executive order to abortions also goes against the stated purpose of the temporary ban: to preserve the supply of personal protective equipment and limit unnecessary patient-provider interactions. Attorneys for the providers stated that they attempted to resolve the issue without litigation but were unable to do so.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas businesses won’t all reopen at the same time, Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday, even as President Donald Trump indicated he was itching to restore the nation’s economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott, a Republican, said he would provide more details this week of how he envisions Texas getting back to work, although he has set no timetable. He has issued what is effectively a stay-at-home order through the end of April, and officials in some of Texas’ largest cities said they don’t expect the number of COVID-19 cases to peak until May. Trump asserted Monday that it will be up to him to determine how and when to reopen the coronavirus-stricken country, though it is unclear what authority he has to overrule the states. Abbott said he spoke with Trump over the weekend and that the White House understands that “what may work for Nebraska may be different than what works for New York.” Hours later, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he was eagrer to get things going again also, but that doing so too soon could make the situation worse. Abbott also hinted at a decision coming later this week on whether Texas schools will remain closed for the rest of the year. Classes statewide are suspended through May 4.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Legislature will hold a special session to address the coronavirus crisis starting on Thursday. The session announced late Monday will be held remotely for the first time to avoid spreading the virus that has infected one lawmaker. Democratic Sen. Luz Escamilla has recovered. Legislators will reexamine the state budget amid widespread economic fallout from business shutdowns to halt the spread of the virus. Other issues on the session’s agenda include ensuring access to medication, preparing for the June primary election and extending the state income tax deadline. Special sessions typically last one day, but this one could continue for 10 days. “We are navigating uncharted territory as a state and as a nation,” said Republican House Speaker Brad Wilson said, adding that the state has a robust rainy-day fund that will help officials manage the crisis. The state hasn’t be able to set up virtual viewings for committee hearings, so lawmakers are instead asking people to read bills and submit comments online. Those won’t be visible to everyone else. The left-leaning Alliance for a Better Utah raised questions about the transparency of that process, saying the comments should be visible just as verbal comments made in a typical hearing are open to all.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The City Council is asking Gov. Phil Scott to halt the Vermont Air National Guard’s training flights in their F-35 fighter aircraft during the coronavirus outbreak while Vermonters are staying home. On Monday, the council passed a nonbinding resolution 11-1 in favor of the request. Progressive Councilor Perri Freeman, who sponsored the resolution, said her biggest concern is that more people are being exposed to the noise now that everyone is required to stay at home. She said she has heard from concerned citizens who said they’re distressed and anxious about the noise since the stay-at-home order began. Vermont National Guard spokesman Capt. Mikel Arcovith said the F-35 flights are part of the Air Guard’s federal mission. “We must continue training for readiness essential to respond to local and global defense,” he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Unregulated betting machines in gas stations and bars have been granted a possible 11th-hour reprieve because of the coronavirus crisis. And casino legalization in the Old Dominion has taken a big step forward. Gov. Ralph Northam took action on several gambling-related pieces of legislation over the weekend, including a bill that would have banned “gray machines,” which have proliferated in restaurants, bars and convenience stores in recent years. The governor is now asking lawmakers to delay the ban, saying the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy requires a new approach. Northam wants to tax the machines and use the revenue to fund a virus relief plan aimed at helping small businesses and improving social services for individuals. Northam’s chief of staff Clark Mercer said banning the machines now would hurt the restaurants that rely on the extra revenue from the games and have been hit hard by mandated closures due to the coronavirus. The machines are called gray machines because they operate in a gray area of the law. The games look and play like slot machines, though the manufacturers said there is an element of skill involved.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A Seattle-area doctor who got the coronavirus and spent more than two weeks on a ventilator is now at home recovering after receiving experimental treatments. “You realize there are times in life that it’s completely out of control and you have to put your trust and faith in another person’s hands,” Dr. Ryan Padgett told The Seattle Times on Monday after receiving treatment at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland and another hospital. Padgett, an emergency department physician, got sick in early March after becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Padgett was one of the first front-line health-care workers in Washington to test positive for COVID-19. He said he believes he likely became infected with during what he described as an “onslaught” of cases flowing into the emergency department.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A nursing home already linked to a coronavirus death is now reporting an outbreak of 66 cases. At least 36 residents and 30 staffers of the Wayne Nursing and Rehabilitation Center have the virus, according to a statement posted on the facility’s social media late Monday. Ten tests are still pending. The nursing home on Saturday said a patient with the virus and several other underlying medical conditions had died. No other details were released. A statement from the center said it is working with local health officials and taking necessary precautions to prevent further spread. A spokesman for the facility declined to comment further Tuesday. Gov. Jim Justice said he is “really concerned” about the nursing home adding that the state health department and National Guard are assisting local health officials. The outbreak at the Wayne center is the latest in a string of cases tied to nursing homes, where a trade group leader said supplies are running dangerously low. Two deaths and about 30 positive resaults have been reported at the Sundale Nursing Home in Morgantown and local health officials in Charleston have said Eastbrook Center has eight cases and Brookdale Charleston Gardens has one.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The state Assembly overwhelmingly approved a sweeping coronavirus relief bill Tuesday during a virtual session, the first time state lawmakers have gathered since the pandemic began in the United States. The session took place in the Assembly chamber as usual, but because of concerns about spreading the virus, nearly two-thirds of the body’s 99 members attended via videoconference. The Senate was to hold a similar session on Wednesday to send the bill on to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. It marked the first time in Wisconsin’s 172-year history that lawmakers convened a session with members participating remotely. Legislative rules require lawmakers to be present to debate and vote on bills but a 2009 law allows for virtual sessions during disasters. The legislation l argely ensures that Wisconsin can capture the $2.3 billion coming to the state under the federal stimulus bill, including higher Medicaid payments and unemployment benefits. The Legislature’s budget committee would be allowed to allocate up to $75 million in funding during the public health emergency and up to 90 days after it ends.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Businesses and others in Casper who violate public health orders to limit the spread of the new coronavirus could soon face fines. The Casper City Council planned to take up the proposed fines Tuesday. If approved after three readings, the ordinance would impose fines of $250 for a first violation, $750 for a second violation and $750 plus possible jail time for subsequent violations, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Gov. Mark Gordon has prohibited gatherings of 10 or more people and ordered schools and many businesses, including bars and theaters, closed until April 30. Casper officials said they have warned several businesses in violation of the health orders. Elsewhere in Wyoming, the Cheyenne City Council planned Monday to consider suspending an ordinance so that businesses with liquor licenses could deliver alcohol during the coronavirus pandemic.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/04/lighthouse-peril-wizard-rock-cable-la-carte-news-around-states/40541683/", "title": "Lighthouse in peril, Wizard Rock: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDothan: An event that bills itself as the world’s largest celebration of the peanut is underway in the city. The National Peanut Festival opened Friday and continues through next Saturday with rides, exhibits, music and agricultural competitions. Now in its 76th year, the festival began in 1938 as a three-day event with an appearance by agricultural scientist George Washington Carver of Tuskegee. It has been held each year since except during the 1940s, when organizers took a break for World War II. The festival now lasts 10 days and draws an estimated 200,000 people annually. The festival site isn’t hard to find if you make it to Dothan: A 24-foot-tall peanut marks the entrance.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A local teacher has been named 2020 Alaska Teacher of the Year, an honor revealed in a surprise ceremony at West Valley High School. Amy Gallaway walked into the gym Oct. 25, as the school had been told they’d be filming an assembly for another activity, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. Students and teachers competed for a moment in a hopscotch activity before Principal Sarah Gillam called in a “VIP team” of legislators, school district staff, and members of the Department of Education and Early Development, including Education Commissioner Michael Johnson. Johnson announced there was one more person on his team: Amy Gallaway, the 2020 Alaska Teacher of the year. The students erupted into applause as Johnson noted Gallaway was selected for many reasons, one of them because “she doesn’t just teach democracy; she has you do democracy.” Gallaway is a Kid’s Voting liaison. She teaches the We the People government class and has encouraged students to participate in the national “We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution” program.\n\nArizona\n\nPrescott: A boulder that mysteriously disappeared two weeks ago from a national forest is back, and authorities aren’t asking any questions. Prescott National Forest officials said a forest employee on patrol Friday noticed that the 1-ton boulder dubbed “Wizard Rock” had been returned to a site along State Route 89. The much-admired boulder is black with streaks of white quartz running through it. District Ranger Sarah Clawson said forest officials were thrilled that the rock was returned and “grateful that whoever took it was conscientious enough to give it back to the public.” According to forest officials, heavy equipment would’ve been needed to move the boulder. Permits are required to gather and remove most forest products, including rocks, plants and trees.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Markers to 12 men convicted of murder and sentenced to death, before eventually being released, in connection with the Elaine Race Massacre will be placed along the Arkansas Civil Rights Heritage Trail. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock said a marker to each of what is known as the “Elaine 12” will be located along the trail from the Old State House Convention Center to the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. They are to be unveiled Tuesday. The men were black sharecroppers convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury following the 1919 massacre in eastern Arkansas during what is known as “Red Summer,” when hundreds of African Americans nationwide were slain by white mobs. More than 200 people died in Elaine, mostly black men, women and children.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Authorities say a dam could fail during an extreme storm and send water flooding into Mojave Desert communities that are home to about 300,000 people. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Friday that it’s changed its risk characterization of the Mojave River Dam from low to high urgency of action. The earthen dam was built in the 1970s near the San Bernardino Mountains. It has never breached, but an assessment last year found that during an extreme storm, water could flow over the top and erode the dam. That could threaten Apple Valley, Hesperia, Victorville, Barstow and even the tiny town of Baker, more than 140 miles downstream. Officials say the chances of such a storm are small – about 1 in 10,000 – but they’re working with communities on emergency preparations anyway.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A middle school dean has pleaded not guilty after authorities accused him of bringing a handgun to school and threatening administrators in April. The Sentinel reports 31-year-old Tushar Rae was charged Oct. 21 with three felonies and one misdemeanor in Arapahoe County. The Aurora West Preparatory Academy dean also pleaded not guilty to two additional felony and three misdemeanor charges filed against him Oct. 3 in connection with a Denver case accusing him of making threats against an administrator weeks earlier. School officials say Rae remains on paid leave.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hampton: A police officer has retired after a civil rights organization raised concerns about his membership in a far-right group known for engaging in violent clashes at political rallies, a town official said Friday. Officer Kevin P. Wilcox retired from the East Hampton Police Department on Oct. 22, according to Town Manager David Cox. That was one week after the Associated Press reported that Wilcox had been a Proud Boys member and made online payments to a group leader. Wilcox had been an East Hampton police officer since 1999. His retirement was a “revision” of a previously planned retirement date in December, Cox wrote in an email. In September, East Hampton Police Chief Dennis Woessner had told the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law that Wilcox’s Proud Boys membership didn’t violate department policies.\n\nDelaware\n\nBlades: Federal officials are recommending that a residential area in this town where high levels of toxic chemicals were discovered in municipal wells be added to a national priority list of environmental cleanup sites. State and federal officials plan to hold an informational meeting in the Blades area next month regarding the proposed Superfund listing. Officials announced in February 2018 that concentrations of perfluorinated compounds above the human health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion were found in all three of the town’s drinking water wells. The sampling was part of an effort to identify areas where certain chemicals used in textiles, food packaging, firefighting foams and metal plating may have been released. Blades has been home to two metal plating businesses, one of which is still operating.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The song “Baby Shark” blared over loudspeakers and a wave of red washed across this politically blue capital Saturday as Nationals fans rejoiced at a parade marking Washington’s first World Series victory since 1924. “They say good things come to those who wait. Ninety-five years is a pretty long wait,” Nationals owner Ted Lerner, who is 94, told the cheering crowd. “But I’ll tell you, this is worth the wait.” As buses carrying the players and team officials wended their way along the parade route, pitcher Max Scherzer at one point hoisted the World Series trophy to the cheers of the crowd. At a rally just blocks from the Capitol, Scherzer said his teammates grinded their hearts out to “stay in the fight.” And then, after backup outfielder Gerardo Parra joined the team, he said, they started dancing and having fun. And they started hitting. “Never in this town have you seen a team compete with so much heart and so much fight,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A commission investigating the Parkland school shooting wants state lawmakers to boost funding for mental health services. The commission is sending its second report to lawmakers, 10 months after an initial report urged immediate improvements to school safety following killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year. Lawmakers have already responded by enacting a package of school-safety measures, including raising the legal age for gun purchases, requiring armed security officers on every campus and adopting a “red flag” law. The 389-page document released Friday advocates new laws that would allow authorities to act more quickly against threats of violence. It calls for more funding and better coordination of mental health services for children.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: Former President Jimmy Carter taught a Bible lesson on life after death Sunday, less than two weeks after breaking his pelvis in a fall. Using a walker, the 95-year-old Democrat slowly entered the crowded sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church in the southwest Georgia town of Plains. “Morning, everybody,” he said cheerfully. With help, Carter sat on a motorized lift chair at the front of the room to teach a 45-minute lesson based on the Old Testament book of Job. Referring to a cancer diagnosis that resulted in the removal of part of his liver in 2015, Carter said he is “at ease” with the idea of dying and believes in life after death. More than 400 people were on hand in the main hall and smaller, overflow rooms where the lesson was shown on television.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hundreds of fish died in Maui’s Wailuku River last week as the state was implementing measures to improve their habitat. The Maui News reports the die-off occurred as officials installed a ladder to help fish climb a 22-foot, man-made wall in the river. Officials arranged for river flows to be diverted to create safe working conditions during the installation. State officials say the reduced flows and low rainfall contributed to the deaths. On Thursday, residents who frequent the river mouth scrambled to rescue ’o’opu floundering on dry stream beds and puddles of warm water below the project site. Small piles of dead fish and shrimp were strewn about the riverbed. Department of Land and Natural Resources Director Suzanne Case said her agency regrets the situation and offered its sincere apologies.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: The University of Idaho has anticipated more budget cuts as tuition revenue is estimated to drop $8 million by 2022. The Lewiston Tribune reports the Moscow university has already imposed $14 million in budget reductions this year that are set to become permanent. University officials say current enrollment trends reflect a tuition revenue decline, and the university has also routinely spent more than what it is bringing in, citing low reserves and no expected revenue increases. Officials say budget cuts could include layoffs, not renewing contracts, salary reductions, elimination of academic programs, early retirement and outsourcing services. They say the university’s goals include balancing revenue and expenses while rebuilding and maintaining reserve funds.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A city official says hundreds of overdue books have been returned in the three weeks since the city eliminated overdue fines at public libraries. Library Commissioner Andrea Telli told City Council members Wednesday that the number of returned books has increased by 240%. On Oct. 1, Chicago became the nation’s largest major city to eradicate overdue library fees. Telli said people who owe fines can be afraid to go to the library because they can’t afford to pay them. She said fines lead to loss of books and patrons. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s 2020 budget includes an $18 million property tax increase to fund adding Sunday hours at all 81 libraries, which will gradually roll out throughout the city.\n\nIndiana\n\nOxford: An autopsy has determined that a woman found with an 8-foot-long python wrapped around her neck was killed by the reptile. State Police said Friday that the autopsy found 36-year-old Laura Hurst’s cause of death was “asphyxiation due to strangulation by a snake.” Those findings are pending a final toxicology report. The Battle Ground, Indiana, woman was found unresponsive Wednesday on the floor of a snake-filled home in the northern Indiana town of Oxford. The reticulated python was wrapped loosely around her neck. Medics were unable to revive her. The home contained about 140 snakes, about 20 of which were owned by Hurst, who police said apparently kept them there and visited the home about twice weekly. The home’s owner had renovated it to house a snake collection.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A state board has approved post-traumatic stress disorder and intellectual disability with aggression to the list of medical conditions that can legally be treated by medical marijuana but rejected two other conditions petitioners had requested. The Iowa Medical Cannabidiol Board voted Friday not to allow patients with opioid dependency and those with Alzheimer’s disease to have legal access to medical marijuana. Board members expressed concern over lack of studies or other evidence that medical marijuana would help those conditions. The Iowa Board of Medicine must agree with the addition of PTSD and intellectual disability before they can be added to a list of diagnoses for which medical marijuana can be prescribed. The conditions would join seizures, Crohn’s disease, AIDS, Lou Gehrig’s disease and Parkinson’s disease as approved conditions.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is reporting it collected nearly $37 million more in taxes than anticipated in October. The Department of Revenue said Friday that the state collected $553 million in taxes during the month when its official revenue forecast predicted $516 million. The surplus was 7.1%. Gov. Laura Kelly called the better-than-expected tax collections “a positive sign.” For the four months since the start of the state’s 2020 fiscal year in July, the state collected nearly $2.3 billion in taxes and exceeded expectations by nearly $85 million, or nearly 3.9%. Tax collections also are running 4.1% ahead of collections for the 2019 fiscal year. They have exceeded expectations 28 of the past 29 months.\n\nKentucky\n\nMayfield: A prominent painter whose works capture the state’s rural, small-town culture is turning 100. Helen LaFrance visited a church in Mayfield on Saturday to celebrate her birthday with an unexpectedly large group of friends and family. A documentary about her also was shown at a separate church in town. According to a press release, LaFrance’s paintings are housed in museums in the U.S. and Europe and in the collections of Oprah Winfrey and Bryant Gumbel. The self-taught, African American painter’s works show people at church, family gatherings, funerals and other aspects of small town life in western Kentucky. One of her first known public works is a mural in the St. James AME Church in Mayfield, completed in 1947. LaFrance also has worked in wood carving and quilting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: A man was sentenced to probation Friday for killing one of the state’s oldest whooping cranes. Gilvin P. Aucoin Jr., of Ville Platte, shot the endangered whooping crane in July 2018 in Evangeline Parish. In a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol B. Whitehurst, Aucoin changed his plea to guilty for a misdemeanor violation of the International Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Whitehurst sentenced Aucoin to two years’ probation, during which time he cannot hunt or fish, and 120 hours of community service to be served with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Aucoin, 53, also must complete a hunter education course. Whooping cranes are among the world’s most endangered birds. About 850 are alive, with about 660 of them in the wild. Nearly all of Louisiana’s birds, like the one killed in 2018, were raised by people in crane costumes so that the birds will stay wary of humans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal judge is considering a request to put on hold a state law requiring cable companies to offer channels on an a la carte basis. Comcast, joined by Disney, Fox Cable and NBC/Universal, is seeking a temporary restraining order to delay the law. The Portland Press Herald reports District Judge Nancy Torreson didn’t provide a timetable for her ruling after hearing arguments Friday. The state law requiring cable companies to offer channels individually took effect in September. Comcast contends enforcement of the law would mean limited choices and higher prices than the current packages it offers to consumers. The newspaper reports that Maine would become the first state in the country to require a la carte cable selections if the law is upheld.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A community vigil, art workshops and a poetry-writing workshop were among many peace-themed events aimed at promoting nonviolence during “Baltimore Ceasefire” weekend. The first ceasefire weekend was held in 2017 by organizers who urged that it be seen as a 72-hour period when no murders are committed in the violence-plagued city. The weekends are held every three months. The hopes of Erricka Bridgeford and other founders of the ceasefire weekends are often dashed, as they were Saturday afternoon when two men were shot. A 24-year-old man was pronounced dead, becoming Baltimore’s 286th homicide victim of the year. But the ceasefire weekends do seem to have some effect. The Baltimore Sun reports a study conducted by Bridgeford’s organization found an average 52% reduction in shootings on ceasefire weekends.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Contests that involve the hunting of predator or fur-bearing animals like coyotes would be banned under a proposal being considered by state wildlife officials. Critics of the contests say that they’re cruel and that randomly killing coyotes won’t prevent conflicts with people, pets or livestock. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife is planning to hold a hearing Tuesday evening at the Richard Cronin Building in Westborough to hear from the public. Wildlife officials say the current level of coyote hunting doesn’t reduce the population, nor would hunting have an appreciable impact on coyote populations. They say despite the presence of coyotes, deer populations are thriving in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is ordering state agencies to step up collaboration with Native American tribes. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday affirming commitment to the sovereignty and right of self-governance of Michigan’s federally recognized tribes. The document outlines a process for communication between tribes and state departments and agencies on matters of mutual concern. It also makes a first-time requirement of training on tribal-state relations for all state employees who work on matters with direct implications for tribes. Whitmer issued the directive during a meeting with the state’s tribal leaders in Mount Pleasant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Environmental groups and activists in Minneapolis and Duluth are advocating for a new strategy on plastic bag restrictions. Minnesota Public Radio News reports advocates are pushing for fees for paper and plastic bags in the two cities. They want customers to think about whether they’re needed. Bag It, Duluth and other environmental groups pivoted to this tactic after Minnesota prohibited cities from banning plastic bags in 2017. The ordinances would place a nickel fee on both paper and plastic disposable bags. But Duluth’s council revised the ordinance there to apply only to plastic bags. The efforts in the two cities are part of a nationwide movement to reduce the use of plastic bags.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge ruled Friday that he will not immediately block the state’s unique, multistep process for electing a governor and other statewide officials, which was enacted at a time of Jim Crow segregation to maintain white rule. U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III said he would not issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the system from being used in Tuesday’s elections. However, he left open the possibility of further considering the case later. Mississippi’s 1890 constitution requires a statewide candidate to win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the 122 state House districts. If nobody wins both, the election is decided by the House, and representatives are not obligated to vote as their districts did. African American plaintiffs who sued the state this year have argued that the system unconstitutionally violates the principle of one person, one vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A bill requiring gun dealers to alert police when a firearms purchase is denied because of a criminal background check is the latest step in addressing violence in a city beset by gun crimes. St. Louis aldermen unanimously gave final approval to the bill Friday. Supporters say 30% of criminals who try to purchase guns but fail to do so because of background checks are arrested within five years. The bill awaits Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson’s signature. Missouri’s big cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have among the highest homicide rates in the nation. Both are seeking to address the problem through tougher local gun laws, as statewide legislation is unlikely in the conservative-led state, where Republican Gov. Mike Parson has pledged “to protect the rights of the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An environmentalist has found plastic pollution in half of the water samples collected statewide this summer. The Billings Gazette reports Environment Montana Research & Policy Center director Skye Borden traveled across the state collecting 50 samples at fishing access sites. Borden says the results are meant to start a conversation on how to reduce plastic consumption and raise awareness. Borden says plastic reduction options include phasing out single-use plastics, reusing plastics and encouraging businesses to eliminate unnecessary plastics. Borden says communities could also initiate cleanup programs. A 2016 federal report found that millions of metric tons of plastic made their way into the food chain and contaminated drinking water. Scientists say long-term effects of plastic ingestion are unclear, but plastic chemicals could build up over time.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A former superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol wants to carry a concealed firearm and is suing the patrol to get it. Bradley Rice was fired by Gov. Pete Ricketts in June 2017 amid a review that found evidence that high-ranking patrol staffers interfered with the agency’s internal investigations. The lawsuit filed Wednesday says Rice asked the agency this past April for an identification card to allow him to carry a weapon. Federal code lets qualified retired law enforcement officers carry concealed firearms with proper identification. The lawsuit says the current patrol superintendent, John Bolduc, denied Rice’s request on grounds that Rice did not depart the agency in good standing. Rice’s lawsuit says he has concerns for his safety in public places because of his work in law enforcement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit seeking to outlaw the state’s legal brothel industry. Chief U.S. District Judge Miranda Du dismissed the lawsuit Tuesday, ruling that the allegations made against the state were insufficient “on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.” In her court order granting the dismissal, Du said the plaintiffs relied on federal criminal statutes that prohibit illegal prostitution and sex trafficking across states. In February, Reno attorney Jason Guinasso filed the suit against the state on behalf of Rebekah Charleston, who claimed she was a victim of sex trafficking in brothels. The lawsuit additionally named two other women who also claimed they were trafficked in Nevada. The suit sought to end ordinances that allow legalized prostitution in Lyon, Elko, Lander, Mineral, Nye, Storey and White Pine counties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s congressional delegation is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to level the playing field for producers of biomass energy. The four-Democrat delegation wants electricity in the Renewable Fuel Standard program in time for biomass power producers to participate in the 2020 market. They say New Hampshire’s biomass power industry has been directly threatened by the agency’s failure to include electricity in the program. The program was created by Congress in 2005 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and expand the nation’s renewable fuels sector, which includes electricity produced by biomass. The letter signed by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas says the omission puts rural jobs and local government infrastructure at risk in farming, forestry, logging and waste-to-energy.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaurice River: State environmental officials are moving to protect a lighthouse on Delaware Bay considered one of the most vulnerable in the nation to rising seas and storm surges. The Department of Environmental Protection said Friday that it will begin this week to protect the East Point Lighthouse with giant, sand-filled synthetic fabric tubes meant to temporarily keep the waves and tides at bay until a long-term solution can be found. The project will cost more than $460,000 at the lighthouse in Maurice River Township in Cumberland County, using a grant from the National Park Service. The two-story brick structure was built in 1849 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It sits just 90 feet from the mean high-water mark, but during storms the surf pounds against an earthen wall just 10 yards from the lighthouse’s front steps.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many state lawmakers say they want to build up the government workforce, but the vacancy rate in the state’s executive branch has clung to about 22% even after pay raises and increased recruitment efforts. The Albuquerque Journal reports state agencies are competing with strong demand in the private sector for workers, especially in southeastern New Mexico, where an oil boom is generating high-paying jobs. Officials say low pay in some state departments and the reputation of state government itself after years of belt-tightening also are factors. State Personnel Director Pamela Coleman says she’s optimistic the vacancy rate will fall as the new administration’s priorities take hold. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took office Jan. 1, when the vacancy rate in state government was also about 22%.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City voters used to picking one candidate per race may soon be marking their ballots for up to five. A measure on the city’s ballot Tuesday will let voters rank their choices in primaries and special elections for mayor, city comptroller, public advocate, borough president and City Council starting in 2021. The system is known as ranked-choice or instant-runoff voting. It is in effect in U.S. cities including San Francisco, Minneapolis and Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as throughout Maine. Backers say ranked-choice voting forces candidates to broaden their appeal beyond a narrow base in hopes of being chosen second or third by voters whose favorite is someone else. Critics of the system call it unconstitutional or confusing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Cold weather is hitting western North Carolina, but fewer homeless shelters are allowing men inside. The Asheville Homeless Coalition called a “code purple” for Friday. That means organizations will open shelters from the cold. But in recent years, a number of shelters have said they would no longer host men. The shelters cite growing security concerns and an inability to ensure the safety of women and children. They also said they need more support from local police. A yearly census of the homeless in the area found that more than 70% were men.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is asking for federal help for farmers and ranchers struggling with wet harvest conditions. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says unusual and relentless wet weather has been overwhelming for agricultural producers. Excessive rain, an early October snowstorm, widespread flooding and high winds have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in commodity losses in North Dakota. Burgum is asking for a secretarial disaster designation, which would make federal loans available to farmer and ranchers. To qualify for a secretarial designation, a county must have experienced a minimum 30% production loss of at least one crop due to natural disaster. In North Dakota, 45 of the state’s 53 counties report meeting that threshold.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An analysis has found a growing number of small towns in the state have disbanded in recent years. The analysis of statewide election results found 12 small towns have gone defunct in the past 15 years. The number of small towns dying has increased as costs go up and revenues decline. Residents of Newtonsville and Amelia in southwestern Ohio’s Clermont County will vote Tuesday on whether to dissolve those villages. They would be absorbed by surrounding townships if voters approve dissolution. The imposition of a 1% tax on residents’ income in each town has spurred some supporters of dissolution, while opponents argue villages provide a personal touch not found in townships. Newtonsville has about 400 residents. Amelia has about 5,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former four-term Democratic congressman from the Sooner State is quitting his position as a member of the National Rifle Association’s 76-member board, citing the organization’s “mounting troubles.” In his resignation letter obtained by the Associated Press, Dan Boren suggests some current and past NRA members have lost trust in the group, which has been roiled by infighting that included severing ties with Ackerman McQueen, its longtime Oklahoma-based public relations firm. In the letter to the organization’s Secretary and General Counsel John Frazer, Boren also said he was ending his NRA membership. The 46-year-old Boren is part of one of Oklahoma’s most powerful political families. He’s the son of ex-Gov. and U.S. Sen. David Boren and the grandson of ex-congressman Lyle Boren.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Many users of natural gas will see an increase in their bills starting in November. The Oregon Public Utility Commission has approved rate hikes for the state’s three gas utilities, only the third time in the past ten years. The increase in the wholesale cost of natural gas is blamed on a pipeline explosion last winter that affected regional gas supplies, according to a statement from the Public Utility Commission. An overall increase of $15.142 million was approved for NW Natural, which serves nearly 670,000 customers in the Willamette Valley and on the Oregon Coast from Astoria to Coos Bay. Typical residential customers of NW Natural using 54 therms per month will see their bill increase by $2.31, or 4.4%, from $52.43 to $54.74.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPocono Manor: Authorities said Saturday that firefighters were still looking for hot spots at a wind-whipped fire that has destroyed much of a century-old Poconos resort. No injuries were reported in the blaze reported at 6 a.m. Friday at the Pocono Manor Resort, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Officials say guests in about 25 rooms were safely evacuated. They believe the fire started in a dining area and quickly spread. The Monroe County resort, known locally as “the grand lady of the mountains,” was built by Quakers in 1902 and designated a historic site in 1977. The inn had been set to close later this month for a two-year renovation. The Pocono Mountains Visitors Bureau said several properties offered alternatives for overnight guests, groups and weddings booked through this month.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has officially taken control of the city’s struggling school district. State officials authorized the takeover shortly after researchers at Johns Hopkins University released a scathing report in June that found the district beleaguered with low test scores, crumbling infrastructure and widespread dysfunction, labeling it among the worst in the nation. The takeover, which began Friday, is expected to last at least five years. State Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green, who controls the school budget, program and personnel, says it’s a new chapter for Providence schools, students and families. A website was launched to provide updates. Infante-Green is searching for a superintendent to manage the turnaround.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Officials have confirmed seven more cases of mumps at the College of Charleston, bringing the total number of cases to 18 since the state declared an outbreak in September. News outlets report the new cases of the viral disease at the school were confirmed Thursday. College spokesman Mark Berry says the college will operate normally “regardless of the number of positive mumps cases.” The state Department of Health and Environmental Control said the first case was confirmed Sept. 17. It said the cases involve both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Officials say some of the cases aren’t infectious, but students should monitor themselves. Vaccination is also recommended. Mumps can be transmitted through air droplets from coughs and sneezes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline in the state are pointing to a significant oil spill in their neighbor to the north to help make their case. A handful of water permits were up for consideration last week before the state water management board in Pierre. The meetings were contentious enough that the process will be extended to additional meetings in December. As those meetings were underway, a spill of about 383,000 gallons was reported along the Keystone pipeline in northeastern North Dakota. Faith Spotted Eagle, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, said it was a sharp contrast to assertions that the Keystone XL in South Dakota would be safe. A spokeswoman for TC Energy, developer of both pipelines, said it’s unfortunate opponents are using the North Dakota spill to claim the Keystone XL would be unsafe.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Three condemned inmates in the state have chosen to die in the electric chair in the past year, claiming the state’s lethal injection method is even worse. Tennessee is one of six states that allow inmates to choose electrocution. Courts in Georgia and Nebraska have found the electric chair unconstitutional, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never fully considered its constitutionality. The Tennessee inmates argued in court that the state’s midazolam-based lethal injection method causes feelings of burning and suffocating. But their court challenge was dismissed when they failed to prove a more humane method was available. Tennessee has three executions scheduled and nine more in the works. Unless something changes, it is likely the three inmates who opted for the electric chair won’t be the last.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The University of Texas chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity has been shut down following a university investigation into hazing allegations. The investigation found that during the 2018-19 school year, fraternity pledges were shot with airsoft guns and forced to eat spicy soup made with ghost peppers and cat food. Officials said pledges competed in relay races where they would run back and forth between the chapter house and a nearby apartment building while chugging milk mixed with hand soap, laundry detergent or vinaigrette. The chapter officially closed Tuesday. Fraternity CEO Mark E. Timmes said shuttering the chapter was the “only appropriate action.” Fraternity officials say the students involved have been placed on disciplinary alumni status. It’s the third hazing allegation in the chapter in the past eight years.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert has asked the White House to send more refugees to the state. The Republican governor sent a letter to President Donald Trump last week. Herbert says Utah has the resources and space for refugees. In the past, Herbert says Utah has been able to accept 1,000 refugees per year, but the numbers of those settling in the state have decreased. Herbert sent the letter as the Trump administration prepares to reduce the number of refugees accepted into the country, while allowing states more say over whether they will accept them. Herbert says the compassion to welcome refugees is a part of the culture of Utah, where members of The Church of Latter-day Saints found refuge generations ago. He says Utah’s refugees contribute to the communities where they resettle.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The town is going to have to repay the federal government more than $137,000 it received to help pay for repairs caused by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene. But Killington won’t have to repay an additional $197,000 after it won an appeal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Rutland Herald reports the issue stems from the replacement of two large culverts that washed out during Irene in 2011. The town replaced them with concrete bridge structures. FEMA says it felt the town went beyond the scope of the agreed-upon work and wants the money back. Select Board Chairman Steve Finneron says the town appealed FEMA’s ruling, which took several years. The final decision came down at the end of October.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Nearly 5,000 acres of woodlands in northern Botetourt County are to become part of the Jefferson National Forest. The Roanoke Times reports the U.S. Forest Service used money from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to buy the property in what it calls one of the largest purchases for conservation in Virginia. The $5 million purchase was made possible earlier this year by a vote in Congress to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a $900 million program that uses royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to pay for protection of unspoiled lands. The land, which includes 14 freshwater springs, borders Craig Creek and also includes the Grace Furnace, a historic pig iron facility that likely provided iron ore for munitions during the Civil War.\n\nWashington\n\nSnoqualmie: The Snoqualmie Tribe has purchased the Salish Lodge & Spa and the acreage surrounding Snoqualmie Falls, marking a major victory in the tribe’s pursuit to reclaim land it considers sacred. The Seattle Times reports the Snoqualmie Tribe purchased the Northwest landmark and land from the Muckleshoot Tribe for $125 million, according to a news release. The total area is about 45 acres. The purchase does not include Snoqualmie Falls itself, but the tribe said it plans to discuss ownership of the underlying aquatic lands with the state. Puget Sound Energy holds the license to two hydroelectric generating plants at the falls. The Snoqualmie Tribe has spent years fighting against development near Snoqualmie Falls. Tribal members believe that the mists of the falls carry prayers to their ancestors, who used the site as a gathering place.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University says it plans to open a commercial compost facility in January. The university said in a statement that it’s working to obtain funding for the last piece of equipment needed to make the site fully functional. The facility is being developed by the university’s Sustainability Department, and sustainability manager Amy Parsons-White says most of the waste produced at Marshall can either be recycled or composted. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert says it’s a way for the school to help the environment and give back to the community. The statement says compost produced by the facility will be used on the Huntington campus and sold to the public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers says it’s “astonishing” that Republicans want to fire his agriculture secretary. Evers appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the agency in January, but the Senate has not voted to confirm him. Pfaff angered lawmakers when he criticized the Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee for not releasing $200,000 to help with farmer mental health programs. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald’s spokesman Alec Zimmerman says there aren’t enough votes in the Senate to confirm him. He says Fitzgerald asked Evers to withdraw the nomination. Evers said in a statement that removing Pfaff would “create even more uncertainty and instability” for farmers and rural communities. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Pfaff on Tuesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Yellowstone National Park officials say that despite the challenges of managing visitors eager to photograph wildlife in the park, the number of conflicts involving humans and bears was low in 2018. Yellowstone biologist Kerry Gunther says in the park’s annual bear report that it was a considerable challenge to manage visitors who stopped to view and photograph bears foraging in roadside meadows, creating what she called “large bear jams.” The Cody Enterprise reports rangers were notified of 1,627 grizzly and black bear sightings in the park between March 10, 2018, the first sighting of bear activity of the spring, through Dec. 20, 2018, the last black bear sighting of the year. Yellowstone officials predict bears will become more habituated to humans as the park welcomes more visitors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/17/unmasked-edition-news-around-states/116270348/", "title": "Unmasked edition: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A Carnival cruise ship docked in the port city Friday so crew members could be vaccinated against COVID-19. With a brass band playing on the wharf, the Carnival Sensation docked at the Mobile Cruise Terminal, where staff members from USA Health planned to go on board to provide first doses for 110 crew members. The ship will return in three weeks for second doses, the city said in a statement. U.S. ports are closed to cruise lines because of the global pandemic, but Mayor Sandy Stimpson said such vaccinations are a major step toward getting the industry back in business. Carnival said crew members have received vaccines at other ports including Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida and Galveston, Texas. Sensation will be based in Mobile offering trips to the western Caribbean once cruises resume, but it’s unclear when that will happen.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislative leaders voted Friday to make mask-wearing optional at the state Capitol and then shed their own face coverings after the vote. The decision by the Legislative Council followed new guidelines the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The council is composed of House and Senate leaders. Under the new policy, masks are optional in legislative facilities, with some exceptions. For example, lawmakers can require masks in their respective offices. “Sen. Reinbold, you can remove your mask now,” Senate President Peter Micciche said to the council vice-chair after the vote, with people in the meeting room laughing and clapping. Sen. Lora Reinbold has been an outspoken critic of mask rules. Other council members also peeled off their masks. Rules were changed last month to ease coronavirus testing requirements for legislators, staff and others allowed in the Capitol, requiring once-a-week tests for those unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated and exempting those who are fully vaccinated from testing, with some exceptions. Testing earlier this session was more frequent. The policy adopted Friday recommends weekly testing for those who aren’t vaccinated and for those with COVID-19 symptoms or who return to Juneau after travel.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Pima County Board of Supervisors rescinded its mandatory face mask policy in most public settings Friday for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, a day after federal health officials issued similar guidance. The board voted 4-1 to change the mandate to a recommendation for people who are not fully vaccinated and in settings like public transportation and schools for everyone. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero announced she would ask the City Council to vote on a similar action this week, although she expressed reservations because it is impossible to tell who is vaccinated. She also took a shot at Gov. Doug Ducey, who withdrew cities and counties’ ability to issue the mandates in March. “It is because we masked up and followed the advice of our public health experts that we are in a position where cases are low and we can take additional steps to fully return back to normal,” Romero said in a statement. “Unlike our state leaders, here in Tucson we have listened to our public health experts and followed the science since the beginning of this pandemic.” Meanwhile, Arizona’s daily new COVID-19 case count continued a weeklong upward trend Friday with 854 known new cases and nine additional deaths. Another 474 cases and 12 deaths were added to the tally Saturday.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: The Arkansas National Guard has ended its work at a warehouse in North Little Rock where it helped distribute personal protective equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management requested closure of the warehouse operations mission because PPE has become more commercially available and the workload more manageable for warehouse staff, according to a Friday news release from the Guard. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports state officials said emergency management staff will send PPE to health care providers as needed. Four to six National Guard members have assisted in PPE distribution at the warehouse since April 2020, and the four who were on site returned to their unit Friday. More than 30 other members of the Guard continue to assist the state with COVID-19 vaccine distribution, management and administrative support.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The governor said Friday that his office is weighing issues of enforcement and workplace safety in considering whether and when to adopt the latest federal guidelines around masking. Gov. Gavin Newsom said his office has been talking with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health officers and other states since the CDC’s announcement Thursday saying fully vaccinated people may skip face coverings and social distancing in most situations. The agency’s guidelines still call for people to wear masks in crowded indoor settings, such as buses, planes, hospitals and prisons, and say residents should follow local rules. But Newsom said he doesn’t know what the federal guidelines would look like in schools, where younger children are not yet able to get vaccinated, and what happens if businesses want to require masks. “There’s a whole host of complexities that we all have to work through,” the Democratic governor said when asked of the guidelines at a budget briefing. He said some governors are quick to “default to the CDC guidelines but now are starting to appreciate some of the nuances and complexities around enforcement or lack thereof.” The state is on track to fully reopen its economy next month, signaling an end to most pandemic restrictions.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former aide to U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn alleges in a lawsuit that the Republican congressman disregarded coronavirus safety protocols in his Washington office even after he and staff members were infected, let one of his sons live in the basement of the U.S. Capitol and ordered staff to run personal errands for his family. The lawsuit, filed by Brandon Pope in federal court Thursday, contends Pope was fired after raising concerns about safety conditions in the workplace, The Denver Post reports. Lamborn spokeswoman Cassandra Sebastian issued a statement strongly denying Pope’s allegations and said the congressman “looks forward to full vindication as all facts come to light.” On Friday, the eight-term representative from Colorado Springs told Colorado Public Radio the lawsuit consists of a “tissue of lies,” and he allowed his son to stay at the Capitol as his guest because of the tight housing market in Washington. According to the lawsuit, Lamborn repeatedly claimed the coronavirus was a “hoax” and needlessly exposed his congressional staff by keeping his office open and not allowing them to socially distance. Lamborn tested positive for the virus in November, and the lawsuit claims he did not alter course afterward.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Yale University is requiring its faculty and staff to get COVID-19 vaccinations before the fall term, extending a requirement already imposed for students. The private university announced the new requirement Friday, saying faculty members, staffers and academic trainees must be fully inoculated by Aug. 1, though there are provisions for exemptions based on medical conditions and religious or “strongly held” personal beliefs. Many Yale staffers are in unions. The university said it was discussing the implementation of the policy with them. “As a leading global research university, we have a responsibility to demonstrate to others the importance of taking actions based on evidence,” and there’s plenty of it showing the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the virus’s spread, Yale President Peter Salovey and Provost Scott Strobel wrote in a letter to the Yale community. The Ivy League school announced last month that students must get vaccinated by the start of the fall semester, when Yale plans a full return to on-campus life and teaching. More than 350 colleges and universities around the country are requiring vaccinations for students, at least those living on campus, but mandates for employees are rarer, according to information compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic Gov. John Carney said Friday that he will lift the state’s mask-wearing mandate effective May 21 after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need to wear masks or practice social distancing. “It’s clear that the COVID-19 vaccines are extremely safe and protective against infection and serious illness,” Carney said in a statement. “Delawareans who are fully vaccinated have significant protection against this virus and can feel comfortable getting back to the things they loved to do before this pandemic. ... In the meantime, Delawareans who are unvaccinated, including children, should continue to wear masks in public places.” The lifting of the mask mandate next Friday coincides with the easing of other COVID-19 restrictions that Carney formalized in an order he signed Wednesday. That order eliminated most business capacity restrictions and lifted a distancing requirement on school buses, while still requiring masks indoors. Wednesday’s order also narrowed social distancing requirements from 6 feet to 3 feet. Administration officials said they would have more details on the state’s social distancing requirements this week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city hosted its first playoff game since the pandemic began Saturday, and Capital One Arena was able to welcome back 5,000 ice hockey fans as it moved to 25% capacity, WUSA-TV reports. Capitals fans were lined up Saturday evening waiting for the doors to open. “This is my happy place, and you know, it’s been a long time without a happy place,” Melinda Gipson said. “I’m just happy to be in the building, I really am.” Stephanie and PJ Atkinson were also waiting for the doors to open. Saturday marked their third Capitals game of the season – but the first with 5,000 fans in the stands. “I think it’s going to make a big difference,” Atkinson said, because “2,100 (fans) kind of felt like a preseason game. I think the 5,000 with most of the arena open, it’s going to make a difference tonight.” The increased capacity limit also made a difference for businesses surrounding the arena. Bar Deco is newly reopened after closing for more than a year during the pandemic. “We just opened back up about two weeks ago,” said Chelsea Sexton, director of hospitality at Bar Deco. “We’re feeling really great about the restrictions being lessened, and every time we get good news like that, we’re just super excited. The good news is coming a lot faster than we expected it, so we couldn’t be happier.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s major theme parks are adjusting their face mask policies after the federal government loosened its recommendations amid rising COVID-19 vaccinations. Visitors to Walt Disney World and Universal Studios-Orlando were allowed Saturday to remove their masks outdoors except when they are on attractions, in line, or riding a tram or other transportation. Masks remain mandatory indoors except in restaurants when seated. Disney requires they be worn except when actively eating and drinking. SeaWorld Orlando and its sister park, Tampa’s Busch Gardens, are going even further, allowing guests who say they are fully vaccinated to remove their masks throughout the parks. They will not require proof of vaccination but are asking guests to “respectfully comply.” Disney CEO Bob Chapek also said Thursday that the company’s parks have started raising the number of people allowed in based on relaxed restrictions from Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office. He didn’t say how many more people were being permitted compared to the previous restriction of a little more than a third of a park’s capacity.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s 26 public universities and colleges do not currently plan to require students, faculty or staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall, according to guidance issued Thursday by the University System of Georgia. The 340,000-student university system in March asked all campuses “to plan for resuming normal operations for the Fall 2021 semester.” Thursday’s guidance further elaborates on that theme, saying fully vaccinated people won’t have to socially distance or wear masks, while unvaccinated people “are strongly encouraged to continue” socially distancing and wearing a mask inside. The universities are supposed to make sure vaccinations are available on campus or through a local partnership, but schools won’t be “responsible for assessing current COVID-19 vaccination rates for their institution.” The university system said that it had made the decisions in concert with the state Department of Public Health and that they were subject to change. The Board of Regents insisted on at least some in-person instruction in the fall and spring semesters, even awarding small amounts of money to institutions based on the number of in-person classes. Those moves came despite resistance from some employees. Some faculty members have called for mandatory vaccination.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Despite having among the lowest coronavirus infection and mortality rates in the nation, Hawaii will keep its statewide mask mandate in place for now. Even as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced vaccinated people can now ditch masks and social distancing in most situations, Gov. David Ige said Thursday that he’s not ready to loosen rules on the islands. “We are unable to determine who is vaccinated and who is not vaccinated,” he said. “The best mitigation measure is for everyone to wear a mask.” Ige said he would review the CDC guidance and plans to incorporate vaccination rates into future restriction guidelines, but for now people in Hawaii must keep their masks on. “The state mask mandate continues to be in force,” he said. “The CDC is not able to help us identify who is vaccinated and who is not, and that detail is left to the state and counties.” Ige said he hopes to get more adults and children vaccinated and for the state to be closer to herd immunity before making major changes. About 40% of Hawaii’s residents are fully vaccinated. The state has among the highest vaccination rates in the U.S. Ige is facing opposition from some officials, including Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who said he believes the mask mandate should be lifted for fully vaccinated people.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The city has lifted its mask requirement, but officials say they’ll still work with businesses that choose to require masks on private property. Mayor Lauren McLean made the announcement Friday, one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can safely go without masks in many situations. Boise will also stop restricting crowd sizes, McLean said, though residents and organizations are encouraged to continue to take appropriate health precautions. “It is incredible to know that getting a free, readily available vaccine is all that stands between most Boise residents and a post-COVID world,” McLean said. “I can’t wait to see smiling faces. We’ve all worked so hard to get here, and I’m thrilled to celebrate this summer with all of you.” Not all city facilities will make the change right away. “We care deeply about the health and safety of our employees and residents,” city spokesman Seth Ogilvie wrote in a statement. “We will evaluate our current protocols and announce any changes soon.” The Boise School District announced Thursday that masks would still be required on school campuses while administrators review recommendations from local health professionals and any school-specific guidance from the CDC.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker plans to relax his statewide mask mandate after federal health officials said Thursday that mask-wearing is not necessary in most places for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. An announcement Friday from the Illinois Department of Public Health didn’t say when or how the governor’s executive orders would be changed after new guidance issued Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Springfield officials said they would stop enforcing the city’s mask mandate in light of the CDC and state’s position. The state health department, an agency controlled by the Democratic governor, said in a statement: “The governor believes firmly in following the science and will be delighted to revise his executive orders in line with the CDC guidance lifting additional mitigations for vaccinated people. The scientists’ message is clear: If you are vaccinated, you can safely do much more.” A statement from Springfield city officials included a recommendation to continue wearing masks in certain public situations. “Right now, with businesses serving the public, there is no way for them to know who has received their vaccination and who has not,” the statement said. “This makes it difficult to keep businesses and their employees safe while serving the public..”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two counties are lifting their local mask mandates after federal health officials eased mask-wearing guidance for those fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The health departments for the counties that include South Bend and Bloomington are rescinding those local orders, while Indianapolis officials are keeping the city’s mask mandate in place. St. Joseph County Health Officer Dr. Robert M. Einterz cited the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. But he said he remained concerned about many unvaccinated people remaining vulnerable to coronavirus infection. The CDC reports Indiana has the country’s 12th-lowest rate for uptake of COVID-19 shots, with about 31% of all people fully vaccinated. The St. Joseph County order covering South Bend was rescinded as of Thursday night, while the Monroe County order including Bloomington will end Monday morning. Marion County health department director Dr. Virginia Caine said the agency would review the CDC guidance and Indianapolis vaccination rates before recommending any changes to current restrictions. Caine said work continues on getting more people immunized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s count of deaths from COVID-19 reached 6,000 on Saturday. “I hope this is evidence enough to whoever may continue having doubts that this pandemic was real,” said Dr. Jorge Salinas, the lead epidemiologist at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. “It has impacted the lives of Americans and the lives of humans on Earth tremendously. Six thousand deaths is very tragic, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg.” Salinas pointed to the far higher number of people who’ve been hospitalized with the disease and had to be put on ventilators, among other effects. There have been enough positive coronavirus tests in Iowa – more than 398,000 – for nearly 1 in every 8 Iowans. People sick with COVID-19 have spent a collective 158,975 days in Iowa hospitals, and the health care system was nearly overwhelmed in the fall. Older people faced the most dire outcomes from COVID-19. People 80 or older accounted for 58% of the deaths. The disease killed 2,335 Iowans who resided in nursing homes, nearly 40% of the total death toll, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the state’s total population. Nursing home residents and staff were also among the first groups of Iowans eligible to receive the vaccine. Outbreaks at nursing homes have since nearly disappeared.\n\nKansas\n\nLiberty: The last two counties in the state that require residents to wear masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 will keep the mandates in place for now to discuss new federal guidelines that loosened mask requirements. Health officials in Douglas and Wyandotte counties are reviewing guidelines announced Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said people who are fully vaccinated do not have to wear masks outdoors and in most indoor settings. Gov. Laura Kelly said the state would immediately begin following those guidelines. Dr. Thomas Marcellino, Douglas County health officer, said in a statement that health officials will discuss the new guidelines with county leaders during the county commission meeting Wednesday. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, said Mayor David Alvey will convene the county commission Thursday to discuss possible changes to the county’s mask mandate, which requires masks indoors unless everyone is vaccinated. County spokeswoman Janelle Friesen said health officials continue to recommend that county government maintain the existing health order, noting that 7 out of 10 Wyandotte County residents have not received a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s coronavirus-related capacity restrictions and mask mandate will largely end June 11, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Friday. Masks will still be required on public transportation, in schools, in long-term care facilities and in other locations that serve the “most vulnerable,” Beshear said during a virtual press briefing. “Just one month from today, life will be almost fully back to normal,” the Democratic governor said. “One month gives our 12- to 15-year-olds the necessary time to get vaccinated … one month also gives notice and time to everyone else who has not received their shot of hope.” More than 1.9 million Kentuckians and roughly 53% of adult residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Kentucky opened up vaccinations to residents ages 12 to 15 on Thursday. “If you want to take the mask off and be safe, get vaccinated,” Beshear said. “If you are unwilling to get vaccinated, you really need to wear the mask to protect yourself from what is a pretty lethal virus.” The state’s coronavirus test positivity rate is about 3.04%. The positivity rate is an indicator of the extent of the spread of the virus, according to the World Health Organization. If the rate is less than 5% for two weeks, and testing is widespread, the virus is considered under control.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can go mask-free in most of the city, Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced Friday. And they can celebrate by dancing. The latest easing of restrictions in the city that was once a Southern hot spot for the disease caused by the coronavirus follows last week’s easing of masking recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control. Cantrell said there are some exceptions. Masks will still be required in city government buildings, hospitals and K-12 schools, as well as on public transportation. And she repeatedly urged people to get vaccinated. “We’re not out of the woods. The virus is still amongst us,” she said, stressing that the city is committed to getting all residents vaccinated. City health director Jennifer Avegno said more than half of residents who are eligible have received a full vaccination series. But she stressed that the numbers still need to improve and that people aren’t considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after they have completed their shots. Avegno also happily announced the easing of another restriction in a city that has slowly begun returning to opening bars and allowing live music: A ban on dancing at public venues was ending for people who are vaccinated. “We are no longer the town from ‘Footloose,’ ” she said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials said Friday that the state will align with the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and allow vaccinated people to stop wearing masks indoors. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the new rules will take effect May 24, the day the state is slated to remove all capacity limits for public indoor venues. Mills said Maine will also lift physical distancing requirements at indoor public settings, including those where people will be eating or drinking. State officials are also echoing the CDC’s recommendations that people who are not yet fully vaccinated wear face coverings in indoor settings. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, said new COVID-19 guidelines for indoor gatherings could open the door to lawmakers to return to session in the State House. Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, issued a joint statement Thursday saying they would explore plans to reopen the building. “Maine people have put in the work, and they’re the reason we are on the edge of normalcy,” they said. Because of the pandemic, lawmakers have conducted committee meetings remotely and have met a handful of times in person at the Augusta Civic Center since the session formally convened in December.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A statewide mask mandate ended Saturday, with Gov. Larry Hogan saying the move followed guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. “Today is the day that so many of us have been waiting for and working toward,” the Republican governor said at a news conference Friday. “We finally do clearly see that light at the end of the tunnel. Our long, hard-fought battle against the worst global pandemic in nearly a century is finally nearing an end.” In alignment with CDC guidance, face coverings will still be required on public transportation and in schools, child care and health care settings, Hogan said. The Maryland Department of Health has issued a public health advisory strongly recommending that all unvaccinated people over age 2 continue to wear face coverings in all indoor settings and in outdoor settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained. Private businesses and workplaces can put in place their own policies. The governor made the announcement as the state’s coronavirus-related health metrics continued to improve. Hospitalizations from COVID-19 dropped below 700 for the first time since November, down to 680. “And today, we have reached 1.91% – our second lowest daily positivity rate ever throughout the entire pandemic,” Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: As more people are vaccinated, the number of cities and towns considered at high risk for coronavirus transmission has shrunk to just six, the fifth consecutive week the number has fallen, according to state health officials. There were 13 communities on the list a week ago and 26 the previous week. The number peaked at 229 in mid-January. The communities that remain at high risk, according to state Department of Public Health data released Thursday, are Edgartown, New Bedford, Acushnet, Taunton, Lowell and Lawrence. Brockton dropped to moderate risk after spending much of the pandemic in the high-risk zone. “The city has been devastated by COVID but it now appears that we are starting to head in the right direction,” Mayor Robert F. Sullivan said in a statement. “I strongly encourage all residents to get vaccinated and to continue to follow the guidance of public health officials in order to return to normal as safely and quickly as possible.” Nearly 2.8 million Massachusetts residents had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Thursday, according to the public health department.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 don’t need to wear a mask any longer, and those who aren’t vaccinated don’t have to wear one outdoors, officials said Friday, also declaring that the state’s indoor mask requirement will expire in July. The announcement from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the state health department came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people. People don’t have to wear a mask outdoors, including in contact sports, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated. While indoors, the fully vaccinated can go without a face covering, but the unvaccinated still must wear one, at least until the state’s mandate ends after July 1. Businesses – including stores – governments, schools and events must make a “good faith effort” to ensure unvaccinated employees and patrons are masked. It wasn’t clear what sort of requirements could remain after the statewide mandate expires, which is nearly seven weeks away and thus will allow time for more vaccinations. More than 55% of Michigananders ages 16 and older have received at least one dose. The state still has the country’s highest two-week coronavirus infection rate, but it has dropped significantly recently.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: On the first day Minnesotans could go without a mask in public, Amber Raitz wasn’t about to do so. It’s not that she disagrees with Gov. Tim Walz dropping the state’s mask requirement in public spaces, but Raitz, 48, said Friday that she plans to keep her mask on in public mainly to make people around her less nervous. Raitz has been vaccinated and said she’s not nervous about contracting the coronavirus. “I think from the beginning, people do what’s in the best interest for themselves and for their neighbors,” she said. Walz’s move to end the mask requirement he issued last July came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people Thursday. Walz said he discarded the idea of requiring unvaccinated people to wear masks, saying it would be unenforceable. Raitz agreed. But she expected many people to do as she’s planning – continuing to wear masks in public for a while. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said at a briefing Friday that the federal guidance is “a sign of progress” in state and federal vaccinations, as well as in the effectiveness of the vaccines. She urged unvaccinated people to seek out the vaccine and to wear a mask in the meantime. The relaxing of restrictions is likely to be followed by growing case numbers, she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A federal judge has dismissed a civil lawsuit a fitness gym filed against the city claiming it violated business owners’ rights when it forced nonessential businesses to close to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves issued executive orders in April 2020 that temporarily shut down nonessential businesses, including fitness gyms, spas, salons and barbershops. Aldermen in Starkville approved local ordinances mirroring the state order, The Dispatch reports. In their suit, Starkville Athletic Club managers John and Joe Underwood said the ordinance violated the state and U.S. constitutions. They said forcing businesses to close is equivalent to taking their property for public purposes without just compensation. They also claimed the city’s ban on fitness gyms is “arbitrary” because the Starkville Police Department continued to leave a gym open for its officers during the time private gyms were ordered to be closed. But Senior U.S. District Judge for North Mississippi Glen H. Davidson said the city has the right to enact such policies during a public health crisis. He said the city did not damage or take any of their real property, and lost potential profits from the city not allowing them to pursue their business interest did not constitute “taking.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A legislative session that began amid a surge in coronavirus cases ended Friday with state lawmakers passing a legal shield against pandemic-related liability lawsuits as their final action. The House vote, taken barely five minutes before adjourning, gives Republican Gov. Mike Parson a priority bill that he had been calling on lawmakers to pass for six months. But even if Parson signs it quickly, the legislation won’t take effect until Aug. 28. The legislation would prohibit COVID-19 liability lawsuits against businesses and health care providers unless plaintiffs can prove that they were exposed and sickened by the coronavirus and that the entity engaged in “reckless or willful misconduct.” Religious organizations would be shielded from COVID-19 exposure lawsuits unless “intentional misconduct” can be proven. Manufacturers who changed their normal business operations to make masks or other COVID-19 products would not be subject to liability lawsuits unless plaintiffs can prove by “clear and convincing evidence” that their “reckless or willful misconduct” caused harm or injury. The Republican-led Senate passed the bill in February, but it remained stalled in a House committee for months before the chamber suspended a rule to bring it up for a vote Friday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state added 89 new coronavirus cases Saturday, bringing total active cases to 1,031. The state has reported 1,598 total deaths related to the virus and 108,015 recoveries over the course of the pandemic. There were 63 active hospitalizations, of 5,154 hospitalizations in total. Cascade County on Saturday reported eight new cases of COVID-19. Cascade had 229 active cases, which was the largest number of active cases of any county in the state. The Cascade City-County Health Department said last week that most of the county’s active cases were among people ages 20-40, a group that also has shown lower vaccination rates. Great Falls Public Schools reported 21 active COVID-19 cases districtwide as of Friday. Cascade County is hosting COVID-19 vaccination clinics May 21 and 22, open to people ages 12 and older. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be offered to those ages 18 and older, and Pfizer will be offered for those ages 12 to 18. The clinic will be open Friday from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Montana ExpoPark. Montana as of Saturday had administered 768,742 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine, with 368,058 Montanans fully immunized.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The doors of the Crane Trust Nature and Visitor Center finally reopened to the public May 1 after a 14-month hiatus caused by the pandemic. While hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes made their yearly migratory stopover along the Platte River in March 2020, thousands of visitors – who annually flock to see one of the world’s largest migrations – didn’t, the Grand Island Independent reports. The cranes’ arrival coincided with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The travel and tourism industry in particular took a hard hit. At the heart of the sandhill crane migration, thousands of people had already booked airplane flights and hotel rooms to witness the crane migration firsthand. The Crane Trust, a hub of the crane-viewing experience, lost its entire crane season when the doors closed March 12, 2020, the Independent reports. Crane Trust offers guided crane-watching tours that are well-booked ahead of the migration. It’s an important source of revenue to accomplish the organization’s mission to improve the habitat of the Platte River. “What had taken us months to prepare for had to be canceled,” said Wendy Bailey, Crane Trust finance and human resources director. “It was a huge disappointment for staff, volunteers and visitors throughout.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The cancellation of Burning Man for the second year is drawing mixed reaction in northern Nevada, where some businesses and tourism officials say they’ll miss the economic boost from festivalgoers, but health officials are glad they won’t contribute to increasing the risk of spreading COVID-19. The counterculture festival in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno typically attracts nearly 80,000 people who spend an estimated $63 million in Nevada. Officials at Reno-Tahoe International Airport are among those who were hoping the event would return at the end of August after last year’s cancellation due to the pandemic. “Let’s face it, our world needs Burning Man right now. If you want to celebrate coming out of a pandemic, Burning Man is perfect,” airport spokesman Brian Kulpin said. “We missed them last year, and we’ll miss them again this year.” Health officials’ concerns were based in part on the fact the event attracts people from all over the world in places with lower vaccination rates and a range of coronavirus variants. “I’m sure it was a difficult decision to cancel Burning Man this year, but I do feel that in terms of safety of the general public and lowering the risk of COVID-19 transmission that the right call was made,” said Kevin Dick, district health officer for Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is planning to ease some of its restrictions related to the coronavirus as of June 1. There will still be COVID-19 screening, mask-wearing and 6 feet of distancing when dining with others and taking part in athletic activities and performances, the college’s COVID-19 Task Force said in a statement Thursday. Visitors to indoor spaces must have a Dartmouth faculty or staff sponsor who would complete a registration form for them. Events can have more than 25 attendees in pre-approved locations but should not exceed 100 people indoors or 200 people outdoors without a special exemption. Informal gatherings will continue to be limited to nine or fewer people. Dartmouth’s goal is to have full access to campus Aug. 1. That would require all students to be fully vaccinated. The college has also said it will allow graduating seniors to bring two guests to next month’s commencement, reversing an earlier decision to prohibit guests at the June 13 ceremony at Memorial Stadium, according to the Valley News. Two tickets will be available to each student receiving an undergraduate degree. Those receiving graduate and professional degrees will be allowed two guests at events hosted by their individual schools but not at the larger ceremony.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Masks are still required indoors, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday, but he and the Democrats who control the Legislature said they plan to end the public health emergency granting him vast powers by next month. Murphy’s announcement that the state will retain an indoor mask requirement because of COVID-19 butts up against federal guidance from Thursday saying that vaccinated Americans can ditch masks outdoors and in many indoor situations. The governor has said that fully vaccinated people can forgo masks outside but hasn’t lifted an indoor mandate. The governor said it’s “only a matter of time,” perhaps weeks, before the mask mandate is lifted in New Jersey. “We’re frankly not there yet,” he said during an event in East Orange, alongside actor Whoopi Goldberg, to urge people to get vaccinated. Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin announced in a statement Friday that the public health emergency, which has been in place since March 2020, will end in the middle of June. “It’s the beginning of the end of a crisis that has tragically claimed the lives of an unimaginable number of New Jerseyans and impacted the lives and livelihoods of nearly everyone,” Sweeney said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has adopted federal guidance on face masks that says fully vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks indoors or outside in most cases, under a revised public health order issued Friday. The state Department of Health announced that masks are no longer required in many public settings for people inoculated against COVID-19, though businesses and workplaces may still make face coverings a requirement for all regardless. “Individuals, including those who are fully vaccinated, should continue to wear well-fitted masks where required by localities, tribal entities, and individual businesses,” the agency said. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said it’s important to keep a mask on hand, but he also sounded a celebratory note. “I can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to seeing the smiles of friends and neighbors across our city again,” he said in a statement. New Mexico is among more than a dozen states to quickly embrace new federal guidelines on masks. Schools will continue to require staff, teachers and students to wear masks at all times except when eating or drinking, the Public Education Department announced. “The mask requirement is unchanged for school settings for now due to the potential spread of COVID-19 among unvaccinated students,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has yet to say whether he will change the state’s mask or social distancing rules in light of new federal guidance that eases rules for fully vaccinated people. Cuomo said Thursday that his administration was reviewing the new federal guidance and consulting with health officials in neighboring states. New York’s mask mandate dates to April 2020, when the Democratic governor first required all people over the age of 2 to wear a mask when out in public or unable to distance themselves from others. At the time, health officials across the nation urged mask mandates as it became clear that people without symptoms could unknowingly spread COVID-19. Cuomo has since pointed to research showing that crowded indoor settings like dining pose a higher risk of COVID-19 spread. The leader of an industry group advocating for restaurant and bar owners in New York City is calling on Cuomo to lift more restrictions. “It’s more justification to continue eliminating restaurant and nightlife restrictions, so that these businesses which are vital to the city’s social and economic fabric can reopen further, welcome back customers and help the Big Apple recover,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Friday immediately ended the state’s capacity limits on businesses and nearly all remaining statewide mask-wearing mandates, returning North Carolina to almost normal operations after 15 months marked by COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. The Democratic governor of the nation’s ninth-largest state announced the lifting of gathering limit requirements 21/ 2 weeks before June 1 – the date by which he had previously said he wanted to rid the state of social distancing requirements. Restrictions had been scaled back slowly in recent months as statistical trends for the coronavirus in the state stabilized or improved. “This is a big step forward in living our lives the way they were before the pandemic. That’s good,” Cooper said at a news conference. He said he was prompted to act by Thursday’s guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks indoors and out in most cases. Still, Cooper warned that the coronavirus remains in the state and urged personal responsibility by those who haven’t gotten vaccinated to protect themselves and others. The decision comes just in time for the Carolina Hurricanes to open the Stanley Cup playoffs with more fans Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Downtown Fargo was surprisingly busy over the weekend, due in part to an outdoor fundraiser and an indoor spring fling, and masks were in relatively short supply. Andrew Kodet, 20, a North Dakota State University student, and his girlfriend, Kenzie Nylin, 21, a University of North Dakota student, said they will wear masks where required. Otherwise they will go without because of the new Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for those fully vaccinated. “If you’ve been vaccinated, and you’ve put the effort into it to avoid spreading the disease, it’s about time to begin this rebuilding process,” Kodet said. “There is nothing political about it with me.” Nylin said it’s been a long wait to ditch the face coverings but added one caveat since, unlike Kodet, she’s old enough to enter liquor establishments. “The bars are packed, and no one wears masks,” Nylin said. “That was a little bit surprising at first, but as more people get vaccinated, I feel more comfortable.” Not everyone is ditching their masks just yet. Akayla Rondorf, 23, wore a pink cloth mask while walking and said she’s fully vaccinated but still plans to wear a mask indoors. “It’s just for the safety and comfort of the people around me,” she said. “Hopefully everyone gets vaccinated so we don’t have to wear the masks anymore.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is removing a mask requirement immediately for people who are fully vaccinated, in keeping with new guidance from the federal government, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. DeWine said in a statement that unvaccinated people should continue to wear masks and socially distance, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends. The governor said existing health orders still won’t be fully lifted until June 2, as he had announced Wednesday, but the wording will be updated to match CDC guidelines. The June 2 date was chosen to give ample time to those who need to get vaccinated. Updated CDC guidance released Thursday says unvaccinated people can go without masks for the most part. They should still be worn in health care settings; on public transportation, including airplanes; and when a business or employer requires them. “The most powerful tool we have to protect against the COVID-19 virus is the vaccine,” DeWine said. “Because of the vaccine, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing dramatically. The vaccine allows us to live our lives more normally and without fear.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With no local mask requirements and federal guidelines easing their use for vaccinated people, businesses are now considering whether to relax indoor requirements for customers and employees. But many are keeping the mask on. William Ray, a local delivery driver and grocery shopper for Shipt, said mask usage makes him feel more comfortable at work even though he’s vaccinated. “It actually does. It puts you at ease,” Ray said Friday after shopping for a customer at a local grocery store. “It’s part of the way we’re living now. For the better part of a year and a half, I’ve been wearing my mask now anyway.” Restaurants were sent reeling last year when the pandemic began. The decline in new coronavirus cases and emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, along with the new guidance on social distancing and masks, offer a silver lining for many. In recent weeks, the Oklahoma Restaurant Association polled its members about how they would react to lifting of local mask requirements. It found 58% would still require employees to wear masks, but just 13% would still require customers to wear them. Many chain restaurants will be operating as dictated by corporate offices, the ORA said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state health officer said Friday that businesses will be asked to either enforce mask policies or check whether customers have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The comments by Dr. Dean Sidelinger came as he said the state was still working on releasing more detailed guidance for businesses. Late Thursday, Gov. Kate Brown said Oregon would immediately follow direction from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier in the day that eased indoor mask-wearing and social distancing for fully vaccinated people. Brown said Oregonians who have received a full vaccine series no longer need to wear masks or social distance in most public spaces, adding that the state would provide more specific instructions soon. Sidelinger said for now it’s up to businesses to determine a person’s vaccine status. “We would anticipate that an establishment or business will have to have a system in place for asking about vaccines status and verifying that. Right now I would anticipate that would be seeing a card with the individual’s name, the vaccine site and date they got it – it could be a picture of the vaccine card or record from provider on their phone – but just a way of seeing that,” he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Schools, businesses and other organizations in the state may still require masks, even as the Wolf administration loosened its mask mandate to exempt people who are fully vaccinated, the state Department of Health said Friday. Pennsylvania adopted new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but is leaving the ultimate decision to businesses and schools. “If you are fully vaccinated, it is an incentive to be able to remove your mask, but businesses and workplaces may still require this added layer of protection for their employees or customers that may have underlying conditions that continue to make them vulnerable to this virus,” Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said in a statement. Pennsylvania’s mandate that unvaccinated people continue to wear masks in public will remain in place until 70% of the adult population is vaccinated. The Gerrity’s supermarket chain said it will no longer require customers and employees who are fully vaccinated to wear a face covering. Giant Eagle supermarkets said it would continue to require everyone to mask up. Similarly, Knoebels Amusement Resort said Friday that the fully vaccinated can go maskless outside, but masks will be required indoors. Hersheypark said it won’t require fully vaccinated people to wear them at all.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will no longer require residents fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks and socially distance in most public settings starting Tuesday, Gov. Daniel McKee announced Friday. The Democratic governor’s announcement came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was easing mask-wearing guidance for the fully vaccinated by allowing them to stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. Masks are still required in some crowded indoor situations, but McKee said easing mask rules will help the economy recover and schools reopen. “We’re resetting Rhode Island and preparing for all the good things to come,” he said at an outdoor news conference. McKee also announced that on May 21, Rhode Island would remove most of its remaining coronavirus limitations on businesses and social gatherings – a week earlier than originally scheduled. That will allow retailers gyms, offices and other businesses to operate with no capacity limitations if they so choose, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: An event for motorcyclists attracted large numbers of bikers from across the United States this year, after the 2020 gathering was diminished by the coronavirus pandemic. Myrtle Beach Bike Week event began May 7 and wrapped up Sunday. The Sun News reports hundreds of bikers were out Friday in Murrells Inlet, listening to music and shopping during the spring Harley-Davidson motorcycle rally. A bar was surrounded by motorcycles with licenses plates from all across the U.S. Michelle Jamison told the newspaper that she got her first motorcycle 12 years ago when she was 42. Now, she rides one decorated with more than 15,000 Swarovski crystals. Jamison said she decided to bedazzle it to let people know it’s a woman’s bike. “Women don’t want to be put on the back (of motorcycles) anymore,” she said. Jamison, who is from Minnesota, is one of many female bikers who attended Myrtle Beach Bike Week. Hannah Guerra, who was out Friday with her mother, Helen Owens, said there seemed to be many more people this year than last year. Guerra and Owens traveled to Myrtle Beach from Rock Hill, South Carolina, to attend their sixth Bike Week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Many people who were strolling downtown in the state’s most populous city over the weekend said the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance regarding masks is good news. “I think it’s a great idea, get people back to normal,” Wade Wilkie, an Iowa resident, said Saturday. “I think it’s great for businesses. I own a small business myself, and I think it’s wonderful for that.” Dina Lantzer said she was happy to move to Sioux Falls from Minnesota in part because of the strict COVID-19 restrictions in South Dakota’s neighboring state. She called ditching the masks “a fabulous idea,” KELO-TV reports. “I’ve never worn a mask, so I just don’t agree with the mask rules in the first place, which is one of the reasons why we moved to South Dakota,” Lantzer said. For others, after more than a year of the CDC urging that people wear masks, it might take some time to adapt to the new suggestions. “I’m so used to wearing a mask all the time, indoors, outdoors, and I just got fully vaccinated,” said Jeff Larsen, of Sioux Falls. “It’s been three weeks since my second shot, so I’m feeling a bit more safe, and I’m feeling a little more comfortable going outside, and I’ve still got my mask, just in case.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city lifted its indoor public mask requirement Friday after federal counterparts relaxed guidance on the COVID-19 pandemic to advise that fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. Local health officials made the determination Thursday in a reversal from earlier that day, when they had maintained the indoor mask requirement just after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased mask-wearing guidance for fully vaccinated people. Metro Public Health Department spokesperson Brian Todd said officials further reviewed the new CDC guidelines, then made the change to remove the mask mandate. Nashville’s mask requirement officially was dropped Friday morning, the same day the city’s remaining pandemic capacity limits expired. Nashville’s Metro Public Health Department still strongly recommends that unvaccinated people wear masks when in crowds, indoors and when unable to socially distance. Businesses can still choose to require masks. Republican Gov. Bill Lee last month removed the option for most local governments to mandate masks in public and urged a few big counties with authority to implement their own restrictions, including mask requirements, to remove them by Memorial Day.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Students and employees in the city’s school district will have to keep their masks on while indoors for the rest of the school year, district officials said Friday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took another step toward post-pandemic normalcy Thursday, announcing that Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can now skip masks while indoors regardless of social distancing. But the district is not moving to eliminate its indoor mask requirement and is still evaluating protocols for summer classes and the upcoming school year, said Alexandra Copeland, the district’s health services director. “Since we have no way to verify vaccination statuses and, until this week, most of our students were not yet eligible to be vaccinated, Austin ISD will continue to require masking through the rest of the school year and with graduation ceremonies,” she said in a news release. Copeland said the district would in the meantime continue increasing vaccination efforts and “devise a system to verify whether individuals are vaccinated.” Following the CDC’s announcement, a handful of parents asked school board members to end the use of masks and plexiglass at schools at their Thursday meeting. Others asked for the district not to further ease protocols, as it did last week, allowing kids to unmask outside.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: The city will allow medical cannabis drive-thrus after a unanimous vote to remove a local ordinance banning them. The Tuesday City Council vote came after a proposal from Curaleaf, which is the only cannabis pharmacy in the town, the Daily Herald reports. State law allows drive-thru facilities, which have become more popular during the coronavirus pandemic. The facilities must follow all other medical cannabis regulations. Curaleaf’s Stan Lockhart told the council that medical marijuana can be “a lifesaver for some.” Mayor Mark Johnson agreed that it is a better alternative to opioid drugs, and Councilmember Paige Albrecht said her husband is a disabled veteran who uses medical marijuana to treat his chronic pain. “And the V.A. eventually was not able to offer him any further help with his pain, and medical cannabis has helped his quality of life a great deal,” Albrecht said, noting that there were “nights when he wasn’t able to even sleep because the pain was so bad.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has moved to the third phase of its reopening plan two weeks earlier than had been planned. The state moved to the next phase Friday rather than June 1 because it has already exceeded the goal of having of more than 60% of the population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine against COVID-19. The new guidance removes the testing requirement for travel and decreases event and gathering restrictions. The new gathering sizes will allow for one unvaccinated person per 50 square feet, up to 300 people, plus any number of vaccinated people for indoor events; and 900 people, plus any number of vaccinated people, outdoors. On Friday the state also lifted its mask mandate in line with guidance issued by federal officials. Masks are still required in schools, on public transportation, and in health care settings, long-term care facilities and prisons. The mandate remains in place for those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, including children who are not yet eligible for a vaccine.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor has lifted the state’s indoor mask mandate in line with new guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gov. Ralph Northam made the announcement Friday along with changes to other mitigation measures expanding capacity for sports and entertainment venues and an easing of limits on social gatherings. He also said Virginia will ease all distancing and capacity restrictions May 28, two weeks earlier than planned. Increasing vaccination rates, declines in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, and the lowest statewide test positivity rate since the pandemic began made the changes possible. Masks will still be required in K-12 public schools. Businesses can still require masks. Employees in certain business sectors, including restaurants, retail, fitness, personal care and entertainment, must continue to wear masks unless fully vaccinated. Tony Stafford, president of the Virginia Restaurant Association, said he expects the lifting of the mask mandate to cause some confusion. “It really puts us in a rough spot because I don’t feel comfortable and I don’t think I’m allowed to ask (customers) if they’re vaccinated,” he said. Still, Stafford said, the lifting of the mandate is an encouraging sign for business owners. He said his staff will continue to wear masks.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: The Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board has suspended the license of a bar in Tacoma for 180 days, after months of complaints and citations. The board said last week that it issued an immediate emergency suspension of An American Tavern’s license because of repeated, willful noncompliance and disregard for public health and safety, The News Tribune reports. The board also said during that time it will seek to revoke the license permanently. In total, the board has received 60 complaints about the bar and has issued verbal and written warnings, four administrative violations and $800 in fines. Use of the emergency suspension is rare, the board said, “reserved only for those cases where the public health, safety or welfare is at risk.” Four other businesses have been issued such suspensions in the past year. Efforts to reach owner Kyle Bidwell for comment were not immediately successful. Neighbors reported continued violation of masking, social distancing and general COVID-19 rules for bars and restaurants, in addition to late-night noise and violence in the parking lot. Neighbors also reported seeing highly intoxicated patrons. The Tacoma Police Department has received dozens of calls to the bar, which is on the ground floor of a residential building.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state followed new federal guidance Friday in excluding fully vaccinated people from a statewide mask mandate. Gov. Jim Justice praised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for issuing guidance Thursday that the fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks indoors or out in most cases. “It’s a good day. It’s a great day,” the Republican governor said. The mandate will still apply to those who are not fully vaccinated until June 20, the date Justice has set for lifting the requirement altogether. He added that “you do not have a constitutional right not to wear a mask” and that private businesses and schools may still require face coverings. Justice also announced that the state will end its federal pandemic-era boost for unemployment benefits June 19, including the additional $300 a week for those without a job. He said the state is considering a program that would pay a $1,000 bonus for unemployed people who go back to work. It would require the employer agreeing to pay half of the bonus, with the state covering the other half. “West Virginians will have access to thousands of jobs right now,” he said. “And we need everybody back to work. Our small business and economy depends on it so much.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Friday praised new federal guidelines that relaxed mask restrictions for people who have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and he said his administration will review whether it is safe for state workers to return to their offices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new recommendations Thursday saying the fully vaccinated can resume normal activities without masks except in crowded environments such as on public transportation or inside hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters. During a ceremony outside the state Capitol on Friday to sign a bill recognizing May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day, Evers applauded the relaxed guidelines. “Obviously, I have to thank the people of Wisconsin who certainly have suffered over these 14 months, in particular the people that have been vaccinated,” said Evers, who wore a mask at the event until he gave his speech. “The people that have been vaccinated have saved lives and have gotten us to this point.” He said his administration would review the new recommendations and evaluate whether to bring state workers back to their offices en masse. He urged reporters not to focus on what he called the “minutiae” of the recommendations and instead celebrate them.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming is easing its indoor mask requirements as of Monday and preparing to remove masking and social distancing rules for fully vaccinated students, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel.

Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville.

In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

The pandemic brought those global gatherings to a sudden halt, emptying convention centers and shuttering hotels.\n\nMore than a year later, in-person meetings are on the rebound. In late August, 30,000 masked attendees gathered in Las Vegas for ASD Market Week, a retail trade show. In Chicago, the Black Women’s Expo recently held the largest event in its history, with 432 vendors and thousands of masked attendees.\n\n“People are cautious, but they’re glad to be able to get out and network with other people,” said Dr. Barbara Hall, whose company, JBlendz Communications, was among the exhibitors at the expo.\n\nStill, it could be several years – if ever – before conferences attract the crowds they did before the pandemic. Many countries and businesses are still restricting travel, pinching attendance at big events like the Canton Trade Fair in China, which required 26,000 vendors to pitch their wares virtually in April.\n\nHealth concerns also remain. The industry is keen to avoid another black eye like the Biogen leadership conference, a February 2020 event in Boston that was eventually linked to 300,000 COVID cases.\n\nThe New York Auto Show, which regularly attracts more than 1 million people, was canceled two weeks before its August start date because of concerns about the delta variant. A construction machinery trade show in Beijing, which normally attracts 150,000 visitors, has been delayed for two months until November.\n\nExperts say one of the big lessons of 2020 is that much of what happens at conferences and trade shows can happen virtually, lessening the need for big in-person events.\n\nJaiprit Virdi, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware, said moving events online made them more accessible to the disabled and those who can’t afford to travel. Virdi, who is deaf, said she’s relieved that in-person conferences are requiring masks for safety. But masks create serious barriers for her, since she relies on lip-reading.\n\n► Happy hour: Will online social time be phased out once COVID slows down?\n\n► Returning to work: Will those free snacks be there when you go back to the office?\n\n“We don’t need to go back to the way things were pre-COVID, but rather embrace the lessons from the past year-and-a-half to improve how we conduct these spaces for everyone,” Virdi said in an email.\n\nPaddy Cosgrave, the CEO of the Web Summit, a tech conference aimed at startups, said last year’s virtual-only event was less expensive – people paid just $100 to attend, versus $700 previously – and drew in more participants from developing countries. But attendees also felt something was lacking.\n\n“In-person meetings provide a quality of interaction that no amount of technology as of yet can replicate,” Cosgrave said.\n\nThis year, the Web Summit expects 40,000 attendees when it convenes in Lisbon, Portugal, in November. Vaccines or a negative COVID-19 test will be required to attend, but masks are optional.\n\nThe Render-Atlanta software engineering conference, scheduled for mid-September, is also requiring vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter. To make attendees feel even safer, the conference cut a deal with a sponsor to provide daily testing for its 400 attendees. Masks – which can be personalized at a decorating station – will be required. Attendees can also wear black-and-white bracelets showing their level of comfort with social interaction. Dots mean they're okay with it, stripes mean “stay away.”\n\nJustin Samuels, Render-Atlanta’ chief experience officer, said it’s worth the extra hoops to gather in person. Render-Atlanta is the only Black-owned software engineering conference, with an emphasis on culture that doesn’t translate to a Zoom screen, Samuels said.\n\n“The actual art of human interaction has to happen in person,” Samuels said.\n\nA lot is riding on the revival of in-person meetings. Prior to the pandemic, conferences and trade shows generated more than $1 trillion in direct spending and attracted 1.5 billion attendees annually around the world, according to the Events Industry Council, a trade group.\n\nThe group hasn’t yet calculated the impact of the virus globally. But the Center for Exhibition Industry Research, which studies the economic impact of U.S. business-to-business trade shows, said those events alone were expected to generate $105 billion in direct and indirect spending in 2020. Instead, that plunged to $24 billion. CEIR doesn't expect a return to growth for the industry until 2023.\n\nChicago’s McCormick Place, the largest convention center in the U.S., laid off 90% of its 2,800 workers last year after 234 events were canceled, said Larita Clark, the CEO of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority. One of the complex’s two hotels, the Marriott Marquis Chicago, was temporarily closed; the other, the Hyatt Regency Chicago, saw occupancy drop as low as 10%.\n\nThe economic losses extend far beyond exhibition complexes. Fern, a 112-year-old Cincinnati company, builds exhibits and other infrastructure for 1,400 events in a normal year. But for most of last year and the beginning of this year, its revenue dropped well over 90%, said Aaron Bludworth, Fern’s president and CEO.\n\n“This was much more brutal than anything I have experienced in my career,” Bludworth said.\n\nBludworth doesn’t expect his business to fully recover until 2023. But he has been surprised by the demand he’s seeing for fall, when his company will be mounting several hundred shows. He's had some requests for help with virtual presentations, he said, but demand for in-person events is stronger.\n\n“Maybe you can do education virtually, but when a buyer and seller connect and go out and have dinner, that cannot happen virtually,” he said. “Our community realizes we’ve got to get together and sell products and make this commerce happen.”\n\nSteve Hill, CEO and president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said 2022 is shaping up to be a good year for the industry. But he acknowledges a lot will depend on the situation around COVID-19 and whether international travel restrictions are lifted. Foreigners can account for 20% to 30% of attendees at he city's major events, he said.\n\nHill thinks virtual convention elements are here to stay. They give shows another revenue stream and help them develop followers, he said. But Hill thinks enough people will continue to visit in person that hybrid events won’t hurt hotels and restaurants in convention cities.\n\n“The shows will get back to 100% attendance. People need the in-person aspect of a show,” he said.\n\nBut Sherrif Karamat, the president and CEO of the Professional Convention Management Association, is not so sure, particularly as more convention attendees question the environmental impact of travel. Karamat is excited about the prospect of virtual conferencing bringing the world closer.\n\n“Learning should not be limited to any one channel. Business networking should not be limited to any one channel,” he said.\n\nKaramat says the pandemic is already reshaping the convention industry. Organizers are thinking more deeply about why their conferences matter and the outcomes they want to achieve, he said, which will lead to more meaningful gatherings.\n\n“I’m very bullish,” he said. “I feel we’re going to take this much more seriously.”\n\n► Zoom Apps: How the video conferencing experience is changing\n\nAP Writers Kelvin Chan in London, David Koenig in Dallas, Joe McDonald in Beijing and Teresa Crawford in Chicago contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/16/john-glenn-centennial-passport-office-pileup-museum-chinese-reopens-news-around-states/117547550/", "title": "John Glenn centennial, passport office pileup: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A military base has ordered troops to show proof of vaccination in order to go without face masks as the state sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases – a rise attributed to low inoculation rates. The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home of the Army’s aviation program. If a soldier is not wearing a mask, base leadership can ask to see a vaccination card. In a video posted to Facebook, base officials said the measure is needed because of rising case numbers on the base and in surrounding counties. Alabama, which has the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases. State Health Officer Scott Harris said that is likely driven both by the low vaccination rates and by the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Alabama has risen over the past two weeks from 205.43 new cases per day June 28 to 559.57 new cases per day July 12. Only about 33% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, compared to about 48% nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s not the vaccinated people that are getting infected for the most part, and if they do, for the most part they aren’t the ones getting sick in the hospital,” Harris said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration said Thursday that it is ending large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the country’s largest national forest – the Tongass National Forest – and will focus on forest restoration, recreation and other noncommercial uses. The U.S. Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, also said it will take steps to reverse a Trump administration decision last year to lift restrictions on logging and road-building in the southeast Alaska rainforest, which provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. A 2001 rule prohibits road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions on nearly one-third of national forest land. The Trump administration moved to exempt the Tongass from those prohibitions, something Alaska political leaders had sought for years. Restoring those protections in the Tongass would return “stability and certainty to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest,” the Agriculture Department said. Under the plans announced Thursday, large-scale, old-growth projects that were being planned for the forest will not go forward, Moore said. Smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, will still be offered for local and cultural uses such as totem poles, canoes and tribal artisan use, the federal agency said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s largest county approved nearly $3 million Wednesday for new vote-counting machines to replace those used in the 2020 election, which were given to legislative Republicans for a partisan review of the results. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said the machines were compromised because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had said she would seek to decertify the machines if the county planned to use them again. State Senate Republicans used their subpoena power to take control of Maricopa County’s voting machines after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him in Arizona and other battleground states. The Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consulting firm led by a Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories backing Trump’s false claims of fraud, to recount all 2.1 million ballots and forensically review voting machines, servers and other data. The firm had no prior experience in elections, and experts in election administration say it’s not following reliable procedures.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas on Thursday said it has asked a former Razorback challenging U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, while a logo says: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” “We have asked the campaign to modify its ads related to unauthorized use of the Razorback trademark for political purposes,” UA spokesman Mark Rushing said in an email. Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. “Jake Bequette is proud of his time at the University of Arkansas where he was an academic All-American and All-SEC defensive end. He will continue to proudly call himself a Razorback,” the campaign said. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County leaders are moving forward with a plan to return prime beachfront property to descendants of a Black couple who built a resort for African Americans but were stripped of the land by city officials a century ago. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pursue an action plan created by the county chief executive’s office on returning the land to the descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce once the state allows it. The county would be a sponsor of state legislation that is needed to enable the transfer. “We are on an important road to set a precedent that could be replicated across the country as we work to put actions behind our commitment to an anti-racist agenda and anti-racist county,” Supervisor Holly Mitchell said. The property that became known as Bruce’s Beach is along the shoreline in Manhattan Beach, now an upscale city. The land was purchased in 1912 by Willa and Charles Bruce, who built the first West Coast resort for Black people at a time when many beaches were segregated. They suffered racist harassment from white neighbors, and in the 1920s the Manhattan Beach City Council took the land away through eminent domain under the ruse of needing it for a park. The city did nothing with the property, however, and it eventually was transferred to the state in 1948.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A pre-pandemic shortage of licensed commercial drivers in the waste management industry has become worse, and now cities and companies are dealing with a shortage of workers to hoist trash and recyclables into trucks. Workers in the solid-waste industry were considered essential workers as COVID-19 started to spread, but now there aren’t enough of them, and many are likely looking for different lines of work or better pay, The Denver Post reports. Denver is working to hire more sanitation workers after cutting its budget and letting vacancies go unfilled when the pandemic hit, said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. The city provides trash and recycling collection services to 181,000 households and compost collection service to subscribers. Kuhn said Denver cut back on extra trash collection, which includes large items, from every four weeks to every eight weeks. In June, the city received 1,738 calls about missed trash pickup and 760 about missed recycling pickups. Denver makes about 724,000 trash collections a month. The solid waste industry is among those using signing bonuses to lure back workers as businesses emerge from cutbacks made because of the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State regulators have approved a plan to spur the building of infrastructure across Connecticut for charging electric vehicles. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said the nine-year program approved Wednesday creates incentives for the building of fast charging stations, home charging stations and workplace charging stations, both for individuals with electric cars and for companies that have fleets of electric vehicles. The decision directs the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource Energy and United Illuminating, to provide incentives to customers who install the necessary equipment. Those include rebates of up to $500 to homeowners who make electrical upgrades to allow charging at home and up to $40,000 for owners of apartment buildings, condominium complexes and businesses that install charging areas. The program also would provide up to $250,000 for the creation of direct current fast-charging stations in the state. Those who install the equipment in low-income and distressed communities would get the largest incentives, PURA said. “We’re eager to bring a statewide charging program to our customers and are currently reviewing the details of PURA’s announcement to ensure it maximizes all potential benefits for our customers,” said Mitch Gross, an Eversource spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Residents of Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park say the untreated wastewater surfacing above an older septic system in the center of the park affects the environment, their safety and their quality of life. “This place started out as travel-trailers and weekenders. They didn’t need a big septic unit,” said resident Samuel Saunders. “Now people live here full time, and these tanks won’t hold that. It bubbles up, and it’s bad.” The park owner, Donovan-Smith MHP LLC, was issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on July 8 for unauthorized discharge to groundwater. According to the notice, the park never renewed its septic system permit after it expired in 2008 and has been operating without one since. The department continued to inspect the system annually despite being without a permit, the notice says. DNREC declined to provide inspection records, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Park manager Clara McNichols, when reached by phone, declined to comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro Board of Directors Safety and Operations Committee approved a proposal Thursday to temporarily ban certain riders cited for sexual or firearms charges while riding the transit system, WUSA-TV reports. The full Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board is expected to vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting, but a date on that vote has not been set. Metro says it has seen an increase in sex offenses over the past 18 months. The hope is that a change to the passenger conduct policy would help cut down on those incidents. The first offense would carry a 14-day ban and the second a 30-day ban, but the third offense would bring a 365-day rolling suspension that starts the day the citation is issued. Transit agencies in other major cities have similar policies in place.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it planned to build a new regional campus in central Florida to house at least 2,000 professional employees who will be relocating from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. In a letter to employees, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said the move would allow creative and business teams to be better integrated. The company already has a theme park resort outside Orlando, Walt Disney World, that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, in a neighborhood by Orlando International Airport. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” D’Amaro said in the employee letter. While the company is still figuring out which employees will be asked to relocate, they likely will be in the parks division. Workers asked to relocate will have 18 months to make the move, D’Amaro said. “As someone who has moved with my family from California to Florida and back again, I understand that relocation is a big change, not only for the employee, but also for their families,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Donald Trump is declaring his opposition to a high-ranking Republican’s bid for lieutenant governor, another sign of how state-level politics is being reordered by Trump’s insistence that all Republicans repudiate his 2020 election loss. Trump invited other Republicans to run against Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller in a statement released late Wednesday. “I will not be supporting or endorsing Sen. Butch Miller, running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, because of his refusal to work with other Republican senators on voter fraud and irregularities in the state,” Trump said. “Hopefully there will be strong and effective primary challengers for the very important lieutenant governor position!” Trump weighed in as state Sen. Burt Jones of Jackson considers seeking the GOP nomination to succeed Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose support among Republicans collapsed after his outspoken defense of the Georgia election results that gave Joe Biden a narrow victory. Miller has not gone as far as Jones in promoting the false claim that Trump was cheated out of 16 electoral votes, but he counts Georgia’s restrictive new elections law among his top accomplishments and has said voters will support him as a conservative who gets things done.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. authorities launched an investigation and fined Louisiana tourists honeymooning in Hawaii after a video on social media showed a woman touching an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. The couple were “deeply sorry,” a man identified as Stephen told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We love Hawaii and the culture. We didn’t mean to offend anyone.” A video posted on TikTok and other social media showed a woman touching the seal at a Kauai beach in June. The video showed her running away after the resting seal raised its head and snapped at her. There are an estimated 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands. It’s a felony to touch or harass a Hawaiian monk seal under state and federal laws, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The newspaper reports authorities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contacted the couple over the weekend and assessed an undisclosed fine. Dominic Andrews, a spokesman for NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, said an investigation is underway and declined to comment further.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prisons in the state are so understaffed that correctional officers often end up working mandatory 16-hour shifts, leaving them just eight hours to sleep, eat and see their families before returning to duty, a prison official said. Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told Board of Correction members about the staff shortages during a meeting Wednesday, saying roughly one-quarter of correctional officer positions are vacant. “We’ve seen a very alarming new trend in our staffing that is cause for concern for us,” Tewalt said, noting that there are about 180 vacant positions statewide. Most of the vacancies are in the five-prison complex south of Boise, where 156 correctional officer positions are vacant. That’s the lowest staffing rate the state has seen in the past six years, according to department data. The staff shortage means there are frequently not enough employees to allow prisoners to move normally throughout their daily schedule, forcing facilities to go on “restricted” status during which offenders may be denied time in recreational yards or day room areas. The shortage also means visiting hours can’t be held in some prisons. Prison understaffing can lead to dangerous conditions for workers and inmates and limit inmate access to programs designed to help them succeed upon release.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated with a lack of power to investigate unethical conduct by state lawmakers and an ethics reform bill on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk that she considered counterproductive, the Illinois legislative inspector general said Wednesday that she will resign in December. Carol Pope, 67, a former Menard County state’s attorney and former circuit and appellate judge based in Petersburg, emailed members of the Legislative Ethics Commission to say she plans to leave Dec. 15. Pope’s term normally would be up in June 2023. Before Pope, the General Assembly went four years without a permanent inspector general. “The last legislative session demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority,” Pope said, despite ethics reform legislation that overwhelmingly passed this year and was praised by Democrats and Republicans as a good first step. Pope, in her letter, said the legislative inspector general “has no real power to effect change or shine a light on ethics violations.” She said the position “is essentially a paper tiger.” Pope, a Republican and Melrose Park native who became legislative inspector general in March 2019, said the position needs more independence to be effective.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Less than one-third of elementary and middle school students recorded passing scores on the latest round of state standardized tests, results released Wednesday show, confirming education officials’ concerns that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled substantial learning losses. The Indiana Department of Education released results from the spring ILEARN exam that show 40.5% of students at or above proficiency standards in English/language arts and 36.9% at or above proficiency standards in mathematics. Only 28.6% of students statewide in grades three through eight tested as proficient in both English and math, a drop from 37.1% the last time the test was administered in 2019. State data showed “significant” gaps persist among racial, ethnic and socioeconomic student groups. For example, just 8% of Black students passed both the English and math sections, compared with 46.5% of Asian students, 34.7% of white students and 15.6% of Hispanic students. Indianapolis Public Schools, which has one of the highest proportions of disadvantaged students in the state, saw only 10% of its students pass both English and math. Neighboring Warren Township schools reported less than 8% of students tested proficient. In northern Indiana’s South Bend Community Schools, 7.5% of students had passing rates on both sections of the exam.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 20% more Iowans died of drug overdoses in 2020 than in the previous year, as the powerful narcotic fentanyl became more prevalent, and the COVID-19 pandemic compounded people’s anxiety and isolated them from addiction treatment services. A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Iowa suffered 419 drug overdose deaths last year, compared to 350 in 2019. Most neighboring states saw steeper increases in overdose deaths than Iowa did, although South Dakota was one of just two states in the country that recorded a decrease. “I think it really reflects how difficult the pandemic has been on people,” said Alison Lynch, a psychiatrist and family practice physician who runs the University of Iowa’s Addiction and Recovery Collaborative. “It’s shocking.” Lynch said in an interview that the pandemic sparked or worsened struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Social isolation, economic stress and fears of catching COVID-19 often prompted people to drink alcohol or use drugs. And many people who had been in recovery from addictions lost the crucial support of in-person group sessions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A racial justice panel appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has recommended expanding Medicaid, adding another income tax bracket for top-income earners, restoring a food sales tax rebate, and banning Native American mascots and team names in public schools. The 15-member Commission on Racial Justice and Equity created the recommendations after meeting with Kansas Department of Commerce officials, Kansas Department of Health and Environment staff and others, according to the report. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly established the commission last year in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The report comes months after the panel crafted recommendations primarily focused on policing. Some advocates in Kansas have pushed for Medicaid expansion for a decade. Kelly promised this year to continue to push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, despite top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature opposing it. The panel wants to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level and cited an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that about 82,000 uninsured non-elderly adults in the state would become eligible for coverage if Kansas expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Concerns about cybersecurity have led the state to extend its search for a company to modernize its pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Wednesday. The need for additional safeguards against hackers means the state will go through a rebidding process, said Jill Midkiff, a spokeswoman for the state Finance and Administration Cabinet. In doing so, the state will request enhanced security measures to protect the personal and financial information of jobless claimants, she said. The state is seeking a contract partner to overhaul its outdated technology for processing jobless claims. That search began about 16 months ago, and lawmakers were told last month that the state was in the “latter stages” of selecting a company to revamp the claims-processing system. But the need to provide enhanced cybersecurity forced the state to cancel the prior solicitation and rebid the contract, Midkiff said Wednesday. “The procurement was out for bid when Kentucky and most other states were targeted by one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on our unemployment insurance system in history, which meant that significant additional elements needed to be added to ensure people’s bank accounts, and other information, could not be accessed,” Midkiff said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A policy governing the use of online social media and platforms by employees of the city unconstitutionally limits free speech, a lawsuit filed Thursday by two of the city’s library system employees claims. The Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic filed the suit on behalf of two employees of the city’s library system. One, Andrew Okun, is identified as a writer and editor “engaged in substantial online communications.” The other is Erin Wilson, who the suit says has a strong online presence and “engages in online humor and social commentary about the transgender experience and challenges gender stereotypes on multiple social media platforms.” Both reluctantly signed documents outlining the policies as a requirement of employment, according to the lawsuit, which focuses on a policy memo adopted last year that says employees can face discipline, including firing, for violations. Language deemed vulgar or offensive is off limits, according to the policy. It also instructs employees not to “engage or respond to negative or disparaging posts about city departments, employees or policies.” It specifically mentions a host of online sites where social comment can be made, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, gaming sites and news websites.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to study the burden student loan debt has on college graduates. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill designed to study the impact of the debt. Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry, of Brunswick, proposed the legislation, which reinstates the state’s Commission to Study College Affordability and College Completion. Daughtry said Wednesday that the state needs to “make sure we understand how the cost of education, and the burden of student loans that come with it, is impacting Maine workers and our economy.” Daughtry cited that student loan debt in America is about $1.7 trillion, which is higher than the nation’s credit card debt. Maine’s average student loan borrower has more than $33,000 in school loans, Daughtry said. The senator said that is the sixth-highest average in the country. The commission is slated to provide a report to the Maine Legislature by January.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A jury on Thursday found the gunman who killed five people at a newspaper criminally responsible for his actions, rejecting defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments. The jury needed less than two hours to find that Jarrod Ramos could understand the criminality of his actions and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he attacked the Capital Gazette newsroom in 2018. The verdict means Ramos, 41, will be sentenced to prison, not a maximum-security mental health facility, for one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in the U.S. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole. Survivors and family members of victims, some with tears in their eyes, embraced outside the courtroom and applauded prosecutors and jurors as they walked by after the verdict. “Having this going on for three years, it’s been a never-ending nightmare,” said Cindi Rittenour, the sister of Rebecca Smith, who died in the attack. “And then hearing that today – just all my anxiety over it, all the wonderings, the unknowns, it’s all gone away now, and all I feel is just relief and happiness. I feel like my sister can finally start to rest in peace.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston School Committee has unanimously approved an overhaul of the way students are selected for admission to the city’s elite public schools based on grades, an entrance exam and socioeconomic status. “We have come to a place where we are ready to move this district forward,” committee Chair Jeri Robinson said at Wednesday’s meeting. Under the new system, students will receive a composite score based on an admissions test and grades, then invitations to Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and O’Bryant School of Math and Science will go out based on rank within eight socioeconomic tiers. Each tier will be allocated about the same number of places. The plan was opposed by some parent groups that wanted 20% of the spots at the schools set aside for the best applicants regardless of socioeconomic status. Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said she supported the change because it is easy to understand, maintains academic rigor and increases opportunity for disadvantaged students. “What is being considered tonight I believe to be a huge step forward for our students, especially our students who have not been able to access our exam schools through no fault of their own,” Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told the committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Canadian government has rejected a creative plan to have Ontario residents line up inside a U.S. border tunnel to tap into a surplus of COVID-19 vaccine held by Michigan, a mayor said. A white stripe was painted inside the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in the Detroit River. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens proposed that Canadians would stand along the border while health care workers jab them. “We’re not trying to send a man to the moon here. We’re using the infrastructure to accomplish a shared goal,” Dilkens said. “This is a sensible, reasonable alternative to vaccines heading to the landfill.” Motor vehicle travel between the countries is prohibited during the pandemic except for commercial truck traffic and workers deemed essential. Dilkens said partnering with Michigan, which has a vaccine surplus, would reduce the waiting time for Canadians who need a second shot. But the Canada Border Services Agency told Dilkens that the tunnel clinic could disrupt travel and carry “significant security implications.” Separately, Public Health Agency of Canada warned there could be trouble if the person giving the shot reached across the tunnel’s white line into Canada. More than 500,000 vaccine doses held by Michigan are set to expire by early August, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman at the state health department.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order aimed at banning so-called conversion therapy Thursday but said it’s just a start and called on the Legislature to make it permanent. Minnesota is now one of about 24 states that, to varying degrees, ban mental health professionals from seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation. Eleven Minnesota cities already have local bans, including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Duluth. Walz said conversion therapy is a “byzantine, tortuous practice” that’s not supported by any legitimate mental health organization. He said his order empowers state agencies to ensure that no Minnesotans under age 18 are subjected to it and that insurance companies don’t cover it. “There’s no place for hate in this state; there’s no room for division,” Walz said. “Our LGBTQ+ community is part, and a huge part, of what it means to be one Minnesota. When they are hurt or put through this, we all hurt. And when they succeed, we all succeed.” Attempts to get a ban through the divided Legislature failed in 2019. Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, said legislation is necessary to ensure a future governor doesn’t repeal the ban and to extend it to all Minnesotans. The Minnesota Family Council called the order an attack on the constitutional rights of patients, families and therapists.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has ordered that an independent monitor be put into place to oversee the state’s embattled mental health care system. The monitor will be tasked with verifying data submitted by the state analyzing the success of its mental health services. A key measure will be whether it’s preventing unnecessary hospitalizations by allowing people to be treated in their communities. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled on a remedial plan for the Mississippi State Department of Mental Health late Wednesday. The order comes 10 years after the federal government issued a letter in 2011 saying Mississippi had done too little to provide mental health services outside mental hospitals. The Justice Department sued the state in 2016, and Reeves ruled Mississippi was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Federal attorneys said during a 2019 trial that mentally ill people were being held in jails because crisis teams did not respond. They said people had been forced to live far from their families because mental health services were not available in their hometowns. They also said people made repeat trips to Mississippi mental hospitals because there was no effective planning for them to make a transition to community services, and the most intensive kinds of services were not being made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported the highest daily count of new COVID-19 cases since the dead of winter, and the association representing the state’s hospitals is warning that the health care system is potentially on the brink of a crisis. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services cited 2,302 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, the largest one-day count since mid-January, as the delta variant continues to spread in a state with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. Hospitalizations ticked up statewide by 47 to 1,331, as did the number of patients in intensive care units, rising by 19 to 409. Nearly half of the ICU patients – 196 – are hospitalized in southwestern Missouri. Greene County and Springfield leaders are asking the state to fund an alternative care site since hospitals in Springfield are near capacity. The Missouri Hospital Association, in its weekly COVID-19 update, called the situation in southwestern Missouri “dire” and said signals for the rest of Missouri are “foreboding.” Mercy Springfield was reporting pandemic-high numbers of hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Parson suggested Tuesday that some of that area’s health officials are trying to find someone to blame and want to scare people into getting vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s watercraft inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats carrying aquatic invasive mussels this year with nearly half of the boating season remaining, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said. Inspectors identified two infested boats last week, bringing this year’s total to 41, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The previous record was 35 boats intercepted last year. The number of inspections has remained about the same, officials said. Aquatic mussels have no natural predators and can clog water pipes and displace native species. All watercraft including non-motorized boats must be inspected when coming into Montana to prevent zebra and quagga mussels from becoming established in the state. Adult mussels can attach themselves to the bottom of boats and survive out of water for up to 30 days. Mussel larvae are microscopic and can float undetected in boat live wells, bilges and ballast tanks. Thomas Woolf, the state’s Aquatic Invasive Species Bureau chief, said there’s some continued increase in outdoor recreation due to COVID-19, and Montana residents have been buying boats in the Midwest, where mussels are established. “We’re also seeing people moving here bringing their boats,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two weeks after the state quit publicly reporting daily coronavirus statistics, Nebraska launched a new website Wednesday to provide weekly updates on some of the information. The state’s decision to stop providing daily COVID-19 updates was widely criticized by health experts who use the data to track the virus’s spread. “I don’t think that was a well-timed decision,” said Dr. James Lawler, one of the leaders of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. “I think that if you are trying to drive down a rivet at night in the rain, blindfolding yourself is probably not the best idea.” Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Olga Dack said the state’s new website will be updated on Wednesdays with some of the latest information about the virus’s spread. The site includes the number of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the state along with statistics on the vaccination campaign, but it doesn’t include as much detail as the previous version of the dashboard. Dack said part of the problem is that much of the data the state had been reporting previously is covered by state and federal health privacy laws, which were suspended as long as the state’s official virus emergency continued, but that ended June 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office has been offering a “second chance” to motorists registered as organ donors by issuing a warning ticket as opposed to a fine for minor traffic violations. The Second Chance Organ Donation Awareness program was implemented this week through Friday because Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the death of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Hammond, a 9-year-old girl from Reno who saved three kids’ lives through the donation of her organs. At the discretion of the individual WCSO deputy, warning tickets are being handed out that note whether the offending motorist is an organ donor and give information about Donor Network West, the organization partnering with WCSO for the awareness campaign. “Through minor traffic infractions, we’ll pull people over and look at their card, and if their driver’s license indicates that they’re an organ donor, we thank them and then give them a second chance,” Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. “Because they’ve taken that opportunity to give somebody else a second chance at life.” Balaam clarified that the program is for minor traffic infractions such as running a stop sign, minor speeding violations or not putting on a turn signal. “It’s not for your DUI or reckless driving cases,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRochester: A nonprofit has announced its plans to convert a building in the city to a drop-in youth center for young adults and children facing housing insecurity. Currently, Waypoint supports about 130 young people in the state. The nonprofit offers a variety of social services including adoption, mental health counseling and child care, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Erin Kelly, program director for Homeless Youth and Young Adult Services, said the center will be a safe place for young people to be able to drop in to receive support and resources from trained adults. The new center will also provide young people with meals, charging stations for phones, a food pantry, showers and group therapy. Kelly said the center will be officially open in 2022.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A white man captured on video yelling racist slurs at his Black neighbors and later arrested on harassment and more than a dozen other charges will remain in jail pending his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. Edward C. Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, who stood silently from the Burlington County jail during a remotely held detention hearing, poses a “high risk of danger to the community,” Superior Court Judge Terrence Cook said Wednesday. Wednesday’s hearing marked the first time Mathews appeared in court on charges that stemmed from early July interactions with his neighbors at their Mount Laurel housing complex. He stood in an assembly room at the county jail during the proceedings, wearing orange and with his arms behind him. Prosecutors have charged Mathews with 14 counts, including harassment, stalking and weapons counts. Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Hutchinson on Wednesday said Mathews began harassing homeowners association board members, who were all of color, over a year ago, including by smashing windows of a neighbor’s vehicle with a rock and smearing their car with fecal matter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico spent $1.5 million to advertise the state during the Virgin Galactic space launch Sunday. The state paid the money to display New Mexico’s logo on video of the flight, KOB-TV reports. The flight saw Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson briefly rocket into space aboard the company’s winged space plane for the first time. A third of the money came from a $500,000 special appropriation by the Legislature to market and promote the state during the flight, and the rest came from the Tourism Department’s budget, department spokesman Cody Johnson said. “We actually have a conservative estimate of around $3.5 million in media value just from the event itself – and, again, that’s a pretty conservative estimate – because we’ve seen so much coverage and viewership of the livestream that it’s going to grow over the coming days and weeks,” Johnson said earlier this week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A museum dedicated to telling Chinese American history marked its reopening to the public Wednesday, with an exhibit on Asian Americans and racism that it curated partially through submissions gathered during the pandemic and a surge of anti-Asian bias incidents around the country. The opening was a long time coming for the Museum of Chinese in America, not only because of the more than yearlong pandemic shutdown but because of a fire that ravaged though the space where its collection was housed in January 2020. Luckily, most of the collection was salvaged. Looking back, there was a question of “how were we going to survive, but we kept pivoting,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the museum’s president. That included a lot of virtual programming, including the call for submissions that became part of “Responses: Asian American Voices Resisting the Tides of Racism.” The exhibition’s outer walls are a running history of sorts, a timeline showcasing the racism and bigotry that’s been turned toward Asian Americans throughout their generations in the U.S. They touch on how stereotypes connecting them and disease have a long history, along with more recent issues like the treatment of Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the anti-Asian bias of the pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House gave its final approval to wide-ranging energy legislation during an unusual overnight session early Thursday. The chamber met briefly after midnight to complete the second of two required votes on the measure, which now heads to the Senate. The first vote happened early Wednesday evening, but Democrats unhappy with the legislation blocked an immediate second vote. House Speaker Tim Moore announced the Thursday session would begin at 12:01 a.m. because several colleagues would be unavailable to vote during the daylight hours. The bill pushed by Republican leaders would retire early several Duke Energy power plants fueled by coal and expand solar production. The measure also lets Duke Energy seek multiyear rate increases, rather than year by year, and directs the utility to find a location for a new type of nuclear power plant. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and many manufacturers are among the bill’s opponents, citing in part costs to ratepayers and the shift of authority away from the state Utilities Commission. Environmental advocates say the coal-fired plant retirements rely too much on shifting to natural gas for electricity. Thursday’s final vote of 57-49 included five Republicans who voted against the measure. Roughly a dozen House members had excused absences.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The same stronger-than-forecast oil prices that are swelling the state’s treasury also could shrink dollars for road construction next year, officials said Thursday. Oil is used for road construction and making asphalt. The state Department of Transportation already has approved 174 contracts for road, bridge and other projects this year that total $350 million, agency spokesman David Finley said. Bids on those projects came in earlier this year before oil prices began surging, he said. Bids for next year’s construction projects will begin coming in November, but most will come in spring 2022, Finley said. Steve Salwei, DOT’s director of transportation programs, said none of the state-funded projects being done this year are affected by higher crude prices. Next year, however, things may be different. “We can only construct with money we have to pay for it,” he said. Contractors appear to be ample at present, and bidding competition could lower project costs, Salwei said. The state typically is required to match 20% of federal funding used road construction, Salwei said. North Dakota’s share of the funding won’t be known until a new federal highway bill is passed, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: John Glenn’s birthplace and childhood hometown are joining forces to celebrate what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday with a three-day festival. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person ever to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Running Friday through Sunday, the John Glenn Centennial Celebration is a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. The celebration will include a Friendship 7-Miler race between the two communities and a Friendship 7 parade, both named for the aircraft Glenn rode during his famous orbit. Also planned are a presentation by space shuttle astronaut and fellow Ohioan Don Thomas, rocket car rides, space movies, and rides in the type of biplane a young Glenn flew over Cambridge to become hooked on aviation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials notified the Oklahoma County Detention Center on Tuesday that all juvenile inmates must be removed from the jail by Friday after a surprise inspection found numerous deficiencies at the problem-plagued jail. The Oklahoma State Department of Health notified the jail of numerous violations in a 61-page report from the June 23 inspection, including inadequate screenings of incoming inmates, failure to conduct proper inmate counts and obscured windows on cell doors that prevented proper “sight checks.” Jail administrator Greg Williams acknowledged in a statement that more improvements were needed but said he does not agree with all the report’s findings. “Decades of physical plant neglect and poor construction cannot be overcome in a few months,” Williams said. Only one current jail inmate meets the state’s definition of a juvenile, he said, and that person was expected to be transferred to the Oklahoma County juvenile detention facility before Friday’s deadline. Jail operations were taken over last July by a trust, which has drawn criticism for inmate deaths, escapes, assaults, and a hostage situation in which an inmate was fatally shot by police after beating and stabbing a jailer.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 50 years after the Macleay landfill closed, Marion County is considering turning the rolling field on top of it into a park. The county is gathering public input and fielding ideas about what the land 7 miles southeast of downtown could become. So far, contenders include a bike park, a disc golf course or maybe both. “It is beautiful,” said Tom Kissinger, program supervisor of Marion County. “On a clear day, you can see Mount Adams and Mount Hood, even Mount St. Helens.” Some neighbors are less enthusiastic about the idea, however. Discussions began after the county sold Auburn Park to Salem-Keizer Public Schools in 2019 for an expansion of the adjacent Auburn Elementary School. The 4.37-acre Auburn Park was bought in two parcels with Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars in 1977 and 1979. By law, any sale of LWCF land must be balanced by the acquisition of another park of equal or greater economic and recreational value. That’s when “the idea came up of using the old Macleay landfill” for a park, Kissinger said. But multiple commenters on the county’s Facebook post about the land expressed concerns about contamination from the landfill and said they foresee an increase in the problem of people using the vacant land for camping and waste-dumping.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Six of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will be consolidated into two new institutions under a unanimous vote Wednesday by the State System of Higher Education’s governing board. Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Lock Haven universities in northern Pennsylvania will form one institution and California, Clarion and Edinboro universities in western Pennsylvania the other. The change will be phased in, starting later in 2022. They will have new names that have not been selected, but the plan is to keep all six campuses open with their own identities and brands, including existing sports teams. Both new institutions will have their own presidents and top administrators. The university system wants to cut student costs by 25% by getting them to graduate more quickly, enrolling high school students, raising more money from donors and grants, and expanding federal work-study offerings. There are 94,000 students in PASSHE, as it’s known, and enrollment has fallen by more than 20% since 2010. Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said students enrolled in the affected universities will be able to finish their degrees, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In-person instruction and residences on campus will remain.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: The only home on a small island in Narragansett Bay has been sold. The 600-square-foot, off-the-electrical-grid cottage on Patience Island – with the unique address of 0 Patience Way – sold for $365,000, according to public records, lower than the $399,900 asking price when it was first listed in April. Realtor Michael Russo announced the sale on his Facebook page Tuesday. “Congrats to all parties involved with this special sale!” he wrote. He did not disclose the buyer, and the sale had not been recorded in town property records. The seasonal cottage comes with just under a half-acre of land, two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a half-bath and what is described as a “picturesque front porch.” Even though it’s off the grid, a single solar panel provides some electrical services. The island, officially part of the town of Portsmouth, covers about one-third of a square mile. According to property records, the cottage was built in 1972 and had been owned by the same family since.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina’s president has indicated he does not plan to ask the Legislature for permission to change the names of nearly a dozen campus buildings that a special committee says honors racists and Civil War figures. Instead, interim university President Harris Pastides said he will encourage school leaders to concentrate on honoring deserving people on new buildings with the same committee suggesting a number of prominent Black leaders. The police killing of George Floyd in May 2020 led to the removal of building names and statues to racists and Confederates across the South. None of that happened in South Carolina because of a law called the Heritage Act passed in 2000 that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change the name of any building based on a historical figure. In the past 21 years, lawmakers have not even taken a vote on any request from the Civil War or segregation eras. The University of South Carolina has a special committee that has been studying building names across campus for two years. It found 11 that members felt were named for racists, including a health center named for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003 and started his political career fighting against people who wanted to end segregation, according to a draft report obtained by The State newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday fired the warden and deputy warden of the state penitentiary, following an investigation into an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees. The governor had suspended Darin Young, the former warden, on Tuesday, along with Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt. Noem said Thursday that she has also suspended Stefany Bawek, who was the director of a prison work program called Pheasantland Industries. The anonymous complaint released by Noem’s office alleges that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says that schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims” and that employees who did not give in to the harassment were made to “suffer by being placed in less desirable posts.” The complaint further alleges that employee morale was low amid wages that lagged other industries, that corrections officers did not have body armor that was “up to standards,” and that promotions were based on personal connections. Nome’s statement said the investigation into the complaint is continuing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s former top vaccination official received a dog muzzle in the mail a few days before she was fired this week in what she has said was an attempt to use her as a scapegoat to appease lawmakers. “Someone wanted to send a message to tell her to stop talking,” said Brad Fiscus, the husband of Dr. Michelle Fiscus. “They thought it would be a threat to her.” Michelle Fiscus had been facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers over the Tennessee Health Department’s outreach efforts to vaccinate teenagers against COVID-19. At a June legislative session, in which some lawmakers threatened to defund the Health Department, they specifically referenced a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers explaining the legality of allowing them to inoculate children 14 and up without parental consent. Fiscus was fired Monday. Her termination letter does not explain the reasoning for her dismissal, and a Health Department spokesperson has declined to comment on it. Brad Fiscus said his wife received a box in Amazon packaging containing a black dog muzzle at her office about a week before she was fired. But he said Michelle Fiscus was “taking it in stride” and continuing to “speak truth.” “She said, ‘Whoever sent that must not know me very well. That’s for a beagle, but I’m a pit bull,’ ” Brad Fiscus recalled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Early in the pandemic, the Design Institute for Health, a joint program from Dell Medical School and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the best way long-term care centers could help staffers follow sanitation guidelines. The institute’s team looked at creating clear signage about personal protective equipment, for example, and how to design stations for putting on that equipment and sanitizing hands. One finding of that initial study, paid for by a $410,822 grant from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was that the effectiveness of infection control was directly related to the satisfaction of the workforce in the long-term care centers. The Design Institute for Health now is running three new pilot programs at three local long-term care centers, all of which participated in the previous study. The city of Austin and Austin Public Health are funding the $90,000 project, which began Monday. The first pilot program tries different design strategies to make the physical environment better for the staff and create spaces for breaks. Traditional breakrooms have been closed to staff during the pandemic. The second pilot program looks at what resources and partnerships can be created to help people working in long-term care centers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought and COVID-19 pandemic have combined to make for a difficult year for agriculture, but the state’s farmers are finding ways to make the most of it. Utah farmers created a statewide food distribution program last year aiming to get food to hungry residents and their families, and managers announced this week that the “Miracle Projects” administered via the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation had helped serve more than 1.5 million pounds of food to more than 35,000 hungry people statewide. At the same time, farmers and ranchers were looking for additional ways to get their food products directly to consumers. Now, members of the Utah Farm Bureau are pushing to find new ways to fund the program and keep it going while still supporting area farmers and ranchers. Farmers Feeding Utah Inc., established to make buying local products convenient and reasonable, kicked off recently with a Utah-product-only subscription box that delivers new products to people’s doorsteps every month. Those interested can subscribe at Box.FarmersFeedingUtah.com. Each month’s box will include new products. Subscribers will also receive exclusive access to an online marketplace where they can purchase their favorite items from the boxes.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The U.S. Passport Agency ended its no-appointment walk-in service at its Vermont office after it was overwhelmed by people seeking the documents amid a backlog of 1.5 million requests, the State Department said Thursday. Dozens of desperate travelers from throughout the Northeast had been traveling to the St. Albans office after getting word that people could get passports on the spot and struggling to make appointments at other offices. The Vermont Passport Agency had been offering appointment slots from no-shows to last-minute customers on its premises, the State Department said in a statement Thursday. The agency has “discontinued this practice due to unintended safety and security consequences,” it said. More than 20 people, including small children, were waiting outside the Vermont office Thursday despite the policy change. On Wednesday, the State Department said the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing, because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the State Department is accepting appointments at the Vermont Passport Agency and other public passport agencies for life-or-death emergencies. A limited number of appointments for urgent, non-life-or-death travel within 72 hours can be made online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After a pandemic-enforced hiatus in 2020, a popular summer event is making a comeback. While COVID-19 restrictions forced the cancellations of the island’s biggest event – the Chincoteague Pony Penning held each year in July – a small event that still attracts hundreds each year during that same time period is returning. From July 22 to 24, blueberry aficionados can sample the juicy berry in a wide variety of creations while browsing through arts and crafts at what is billed as the “largest fine arts and crafts event on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.” The 33rd annual Blueberry Festival promises plenty of blueberry treats for attendees, along with live entertainment and both indoor and outdoor exhibits featuring artists and crafters from the Shore and beyond. The festival will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day at the Chincoteague Center. In addition to popular blueberry=themed foods such as ice cream, pie and cakes, four food vendors will be on hand, offering options including pizza, seafood, and Middle Eastern and Mexican specialties. Live music will be offered throughout the three days of the festival, featuring popular returning and new acts.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian police watchdog group has found that an officer repeatedly worked over 90 hours a week and earned so much overtime that he was the highest-paid city employee one year at more than $400,000 – and none of his supervisors noticed. The review by Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability of the case of Officer Ron Willis found 15 times in which he worked more than 90 hours a week in 2019 and identified numerous gaps in the Seattle Police Department’s ability to monitor overtime, The Seattle Times reports. In a letter to interim Chief Adrian Diaz, OPA director Andrew Myerberg urged the police department to track hours in a centralized database or require the department’s human resources staff to “flag employees who may be working excess hours.” As a result of the review, Willis was suspended for one day without pay for working more than the maximum hours allowed by department rules. A police spokesperson said Willis wasn’t available for comment, and efforts to reach him by the newspaper weren’t successful. The police department has long struggled to monitor overtime and has been the subject of multiple critical findings from city auditors and the oversight group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Gov. Jim Justice visited Thomas Jackson’s office at West Virginia University’s Robotic Technology Center in Fairmont on Wednesday to present the latest million-dollar prize in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes, according to a news release. Justice was accompanied by his pet English bulldog – Babydog – who is the mascot of the “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes. The Republican governor also surprised two residents with brand-new, custom-outfitted trucks and two more with four-year scholarships to any public institution in the state. Other West Virginians won lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, custom hunting rifles, custom hunting shotguns, and weekend getaways to West Virginia state parks. Earlier in the week, Justice confronted outlandish conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines and set higher targets for vaccinating residents age 50 and older. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he recently had a meal with a group of people who believed in the baseless conspiracy theory that “there was something in the vaccine that would enable the federal government to track us.” The governor dismissed it and urged more people to get their shots. “It’s just a stretch beyond what I can believe,” he said. Justice noted that the phones people carry around with them have more tracking potential.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Gov. Tony Evers joined local and state economic leaders in the city Wednesday to announce that he will direct $130million in federal funding toward workforce development programs. The funds, which come from the state’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation, will be spread across three programs that will help regions find solutions to workforce challenges and help unemployed or underemployed workers find job opportunities. The Democratic governor said there is “no one-size-fits all-solution” to workforce challenges. “I’ve heard from many Wisconsin business owners, employers, out-of-work job-seekers that while employment in Wisconsin continues to grow, our economy is facing obviously a workforce shortage. A shortage that existed well before I became governor but has been made worse obviously by this pandemic,” Evers said. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in May 2021 – the most recent month reported by the state – was 3.9%, tied for the 10th-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest block of funding will provide grants to at least 10 local and regional entities with about $10 million each to help meet needs including child care, transportation and housing. Evers said that funding would go out sometime in the fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A magician and comic has canceled performances at libraries in northeastern Wyoming because of threats over a social media post about her being a transgender woman, she said. The Campbell County Library posted on its Facebook page that Mikayla Oz, 24, was canceling shows planned for Wednesday and Thursday in Gillette and Wright out of safety concerns for herself, library staff and patrons, the Gillette News Record reports. The fact that Oz is a transgender woman was shared on a social media post, leading to misinformation about her performances and calls to protest the events, library officials said. Oz, from Des Moines, Iowa, has performed at libraries, schools and other events. She said the show she planned is family-friendly and doesn’t have an LGBTQ message. She was initially willing to do her show despite some complaints, but then she started receiving violent and frightening threats online and by telephone, she said. Library director Terri Lesley said her staff also received threats from a patron. Oz’s gender identity was not previously known to library staff, nor is it something they consider relevant, Lesley said. “It just breaks my heart, especially when my show has absolutely nothing to do with my back story at all,” Oz said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/20/mail-carrier-legacy-pardoning-witch-hermit-rebuild-news-around-states/118453564/", "title": "Mail carrier legacy, pardoning a 'witch': News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The City Council has rejected 5-4 an anti-discrimination ordinance that would have protected LGBTQ residents and others, even as Mayor Steven Reed threatened to send businesses to Birmingham if the vote failed. Reed said the two-month process leading to the vote showed that he was wrong to tell companies how far the city has come. If the vote failed, he said, he would be forced to tell businesses that value diversity and inclusiveness that “maybe this isn’t the place for that project because I can’t stand behind it. Maybe this isn’t the place for what your employees are looking for because I can’t tell you in good faith that this city ... shares your values and your vision.” He also threatened to give Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin’s cellphone number to those businesses. Birmingham’s council passed a similar ordinance in 2017. “They’ve learned from their mistakes,” Reed said. Councilwoman Audrey Graham, who voted against the Montgomery ordinance, asked Reed if he’s serious about that threat. He responded: “Those individuals that ask me an honest question, then I’m going to give them an honest answer.” The ordinance would have made it illegal to discriminate against a range of groups in the areas of public accommodation, housing and employment, as well as in all city practices, including contracting.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal judge on Wednesday threw out Trump administration approvals for a large planned oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, saying the federal review was flawed and didn’t include mitigation measures for polar bears. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage vacated permits for ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in a 110-page ruling. The Trump administration approved the project in late 2020, and the Biden administration defended the project in court. Rebecca Boys, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson, said the company would review Gleason’s decision “and evaluate the options available regarding this project.” Spokespersons for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department said their agencies had no comment. The Bureau of Land Management conducted the environmental review of the project that Gleason found flawed. Conservation groups and Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, described as a grassroots organization, had challenged the adequacy of the review process. Karlin Itchoak, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society, in a statement called the ruling “a step toward protecting public lands and the people who would be most negatively impacted by the BLM’s haphazard greenlighting of the Willow project.”\n\nArizona\n\nBullhead City: Employees in a northwestern Arizona school district cannot discuss vaccination status or mask-wearing with students under a motion approved unanimously by the local school board. The edict from the Colorado River Union High School District Governing Board carries no repercussions for administrators, staff or teachers who violate it. That would be up to Superintendent Monte Silk, who supported the motion. The debate over masks and vaccines in schools has been heated. At least 26 school districts in Arizona have enacted their own mask mandates, even as Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has tried to prevent them and threatened schools with a loss of funding. Those school districts account for nearly 300,000 students and 450 schools, mostly around Phoenix and Tucson. The Colorado River Union High School District’s gag rule, however, is rare. Board member Ashley Gerich, who calls herself a “non-vaxxer,” requested the item be put on the board’s agenda this week. She said a couple of students, including her daughter, told her conversations about the vaccine made them feel uncomfortable, the Mohave Daily News reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Three parents are suing over a northwest Arkansas school district’s decision to require face masks after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate ban. The lawsuit filed Wednesday over the Bentonville School District’s mandate argues the local school board had no authority to impose the requirement. The parents are asking a Benton County judge to temporarily block the district from enforcing the ban while they challenge it. The parents are “forced to choose either to exercise their fundamental liberty interests in refusing to place face coverings on their children against their will or for the children to face expulsion from school,” the lawsuit said. Public health officials have urged schools to require masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus due to the highly contagious delta variant. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. More than 70 public school districts and charter schools have imposed mask mandates since Arkansas’ ban against them was blocked. The requirements cover more than half of the state’s public school students. “Our legal counsel is currently reviewing the matter and we look forward to a vigorous defense of our district,” Leslee Wright, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville School District, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A major Southern California water agency has declared a water supply alert for the first time in seven years and is asking residents to voluntarily conserve. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California took the step Tuesday, hoping to lessen the need for more severe actions such as reducing water supplies to member agencies. The move came a day after U.S. officials declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River, a key water source for Southern California. “This is a wake-up call for what lies ahead,” said Deven Upadhyay, chief operating officer for the district that supplies water to 19 million Californians, from the Los Angeles area to U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot overstate the seriousness of this drought,” he said. “Conditions are getting worse, and more importantly, we don’t know how long it will last.” Gov. Gavin Newsom last month asked Californians to scale back water use, and many of the state’s counties, mostly in Central and Northern California, are already under a state of drought emergency. Concern about water supplies spread to the state’s heavily populated southern region following a winter of low precipitation and shrinking reservoirs throughout the West.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: Forest Service officials said Wednesday that Hanging Lake Trail, a popular tourist destination in western Colorado, will be closed for the rest of the summer season and likely beyond because of extensive damage caused by large mudslides in late July. The announcement came after a preliminary assessment earlier in the week that revealed damaged and destroyed bridges, as well as large sections of the trail blocked by debris and mud. “The Hanging Lake Trail is not safe and impassable in some areas and will remain closed for the foreseeable future,” said White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams. “The debris flows we saw in July are probably not the last we will see, so there could be additional damage in the weeks and months ahead.” The trail leads to the emerald-colored Hanging Lake, which is designated as a National Natural Landmark and is about 1,000 feet up a side canyon of Glenwood Canyon. The lake was discolored by mud flows that resulted from a wildfire that torched the area last summer. “The good news is that the water in Hanging Lake is clearing from the debris flow, the boardwalk at the lake wasn’t damaged, and the fish are still swimming,” Fitzwilliams said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAshford: Ground was broken Wednesday at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children to replace buildings that burned to the ground in a February fire. The Feb. 12 blaze at the camp founded by the late actor Paul Newman destroyed a section of the eastern Connecticut camp that was made to look like the center of an Old West town. It had housed the camp’s woodworking shop, the arts and crafts area, the camp store, and its educational kitchen. Camp officials said they have received 4,500 donations for the rebuild, including a $1 million match from Travelers and the Travelers Championship golf tournament and a $1 million gift from Newman’s Own Foundation. That will allow the camp to build a new, accessible single-level “creative complex” that will not only replace what was lost but also include new features, such as a quiet sensory area for campers and dedicated space for parents and caregivers. “We want to dedicate this moment to everyone who helped us heal and made us whole again,” said Jimmy Canton, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp’s chief executive officer. “Your kindness was the bridge that brought us from grief to gratitude, and your friendship is why we are able to celebrate this milestone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Police are investigating after photos of two officers who appear to be sleeping in their patrol vehicles were posted on social media. Police said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the department was looking into the matter and that such “behavior is unacceptable to our agency, unfair to our citizens, and certainly outside of department policy.” One photo shows an officer leaned back in his driver’s seat with his eyes shut and his mouth partially open. The other shows an officer leaned back in a police SUV driver’s seat facing away from the car window and toward a computer screen. The officers, who have not been named, were scheduled to meet with command staff late Tuesday, police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hoffman said. The department’s code of conduct states that the health, well-being and overall safety of officers is a top priority. Police said in a statement that officers are encouraged not to operate vehicles when fatigued and urged to speak with a supervisor “so proper measures can be taken” if they feel unwell or unusually fatigued. “With that being said, there is no language that allows such activity,” the department said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Canceled because of the pandemic 16 months ago, Honor Flights to Washington resumed Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The program brings veterans from around the nation to D.C. to see the memorials built in their honor. The flights and tours are free. At the World War II Memorial, 113 veterans were visiting Wednesday from the Honor Flight hub in Chicago. “Probably the most touching moments are watching watching the veterans reflect as they look at the Wall of Stars,” said David Smith, president of the Honor Flight Network. “There are over 400,000 stars there; it represents those that were lost.” Wednesday’s visit honored three veterans from World War II, 34 who served in the Korean War, and 76 veterans of the Vietnam conflict.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The number of U.S. tourists who came to Sunshine State in the second quarter of this year has returned to pre-pandemic levels, though the international market is still lagging, according to figures released Thursday. Florida received about 30.6 million domestic visitors from April through June, a 6% increase over the same time in 2019 and a 216% jump from the same time last year, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic closures, state tourism marketing firm Visit Florida said in a news release. Overall, the state had 31.4 million visitors in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 220% from the same period a year earlier. Florida’s international market has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due in part to restrictions on entering the United States. Florida welcomed only 1.1 million visitors from overseas and Canada in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3.5 million visitors in the second quarter of 2019. During the spring of 2020, Florida’s major theme parks and hotels around the state were either shuttered or had limited operations due to the pandemic. As of Thursday, though, Walt Disney World is tweaking its face mask policy, allowing visitors to choose whether to wear face coverings in outdoor lines, outdoor theaters and outdoor attractions. Masks had been required previously.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Health care providers at some of the state’s largest hospital systems warned Thursday about the increasing toll of the latest coronavirus surge on younger patients, hospital staffs and health care capacity as they implored people to get vaccinated, wear masks and avoid large gatherings. The guidance came as the state’s hospitals – already struggling with rising patient numbers – brace for even higher COVID-19 case counts that could surpass a winter peak. “The unfortunate thing is we don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘We’re full, and we’re closed,’ ” said Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at Atlanta’s Grady Health System. “We’re not a hotel, so people will continue to come and our staff will continue to cope, and we’ll continue to find places to take care of these patients, but it is going to be difficult, and it’s not going to be easy, and it won’t make people happy.” Jansen said the hospital’s emergency room is facing a “tsunami” of patients infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus, forcing staff to divert ambulances to other hospitals for quicker care. As at other hospitals in the state, the influx is primarily people who are unvaccinated.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Officials on the Big Island are considering closing beaches and canceling the Ironman World Championship in response to a surge of coronavirus cases. “Right now our numbers are skyrocketing. It’s a shame because we as a county have been doing a great job,” Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth told County Council members. “But we let down our guards – I let down my guard.” The administration is revising its emergency rules and will submit the changes to Gov. David Ige for approval, West Hawaii Today reports. That revision could include a return to restrictions at parks and beaches that allow people to cross the sand only to get to the ocean to surf, swim or fish but not to gather or sit. Similar restrictions were enacted across Hawaii during the peak of the pandemic last year. The Ironman World Championship is currently set for Oct. 9 in Kailua-Kona. Roth said a decision would be made soon about whether the event could go on. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t look too positive for Ironman this year,” the mayor said. “The question with Ironman is what do you do with all the people who come to spectate.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Students across the state lost some academic ground during the coronavirus pandemic, with standardized testing scores dropping in math and language arts compared to 2019. The Idaho Department of Education released the Idaho Standardized Achievement Test scores Tuesday. The test – required under federal rules – is typically administered to students in third through eighth grades and 10th grade each spring. But the 2020 test was canceled after the federal requirement was temporarily lifted as schools closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the 2021 round of testing, students showed the biggest decline in math skills, with 39.6% of students testing at “proficient” or “advanced” levels this spring, compared to 44.4% two years ago. English language arts skills had a smaller drop, with just over 54% of students scoring as proficient or advanced compared to 55% in 2019. “The onset of the pandemic in spring 2020 disrupted the ISAT along with all Idaho school operations, so we weren’t surprised that scores did not continue the gradual upward trend of the previous few years of testing,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra said in a statement. “We expected an impact, and now we can use these results to move forward to rebuild academic performance.”\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Some residents are crying foul over a proposed museum for women’s baseball in a city that had one of the sport’s most successful teams in the 1940s. A zoning board postponed a decision Tuesday on a permit for the project at Beyer Park. The Rockford Park District is willing to sell an acre of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. A group called Friends of Beyer Stadium said it supports the concept but has acquired land directly west of Beyer Park.“Shame on you,” said Greg Schwanke, president of Friends of Beyer Stadium. “I spent 14 years out there building this place and turned it into a national attraction for the city of Rockford. We’re not going down. We’re fighting all of the way.” The Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League played at Beyer Stadium. The team was featured in the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own,” with Tom Hanks, Madonna and Geena Davis. The International Women’s Baseball Center is launching a $10 million fundraising campaign for construction of a museum and activity center. “We’ve had people already calling us from outside the area asking us when the museum is going to open,” said Rosemary Collins, a retired judge involved with the group. “They will travel here to see it. It will have an economic boon for the entire area.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Facing a pandemic unlike any his predecessors have seen, Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday announced the formation of a public health commission that will spend the next year finding ways to improve the overall health of Hoosiers. While COVID-19 response will figure into the work of the 15-person commission, Holcomb said the panel’s scope would go far beyond this latest crisis. “We’ve got our game plan right now to continue to work through the pandemic,” he said. “That’s not what this commission or this task force is about. This is a long-term look at where we want our state to be decades from now.” Holcomb tapped longtime Republican politician Luke Kenley and former state health commissioner Dr. Judy Monroe to co-chair the body. The group will convene for the first time next month and is expected to issue a report by next summer, in time for 2023 budget discussions, Holcomb said. Over the past year, Holcomb has weathered criticism from all sides for his handling of the pandemic. Some have complained that he has not done enough to halt the spread of the coronavirus, lifting restrictions like the mask mandate too soon. Others have complained that he overreached his authority in taking steps such as that mask mandate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state would welcome refugees from Afghanistan who want to resettle in Iowa, saying their situation is much different from the immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border whom the Republican governor refused to accept in April. Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst discussed plans to take refugees while attending the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday. “We’re working with the State Department right now; we’re offering our opportunity to settle here in Iowa,” Ernst said. The Republican senator said she is working with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to push the U.S. Department of State to allow as many people as possible to qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa Program, designed to aid people who worked with the U.S. military as interpreters or translators in Iraq or Afghanistan. The U.S. Bureau of Refugee Services has said Iowa could take as many as 2,000 refugees a year, and Reynolds didn’t disagree with that number. “We’ll work with them to determine what that looks like and just make sure we have a process in place and we have families and homes for them to go,” she said. “We want to be a partner, we want them here, and we want them to know that.” In April Reynolds said she rejected a federal request to accept migrant children from the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that “is the president’s problem.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Officials in some communities are battling a rise in COVID-19 cases by mandating masks for kids, issuing emergency orders and requiring vaccines. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Kansas has risen over the past two weeks from 605.14 new cases per day Aug. 3 to 797.14 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the Lawrence area, Douglas County leaders approved a health order Wednesday that will require children ages 2 to 12 to wear masks while in indoor public spaces. The decision followed four hours of public comment that included jeering and interruptions from a largely maskless crowd, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Douglas County’s health officer, Dr. Thomas Marcellino was momentarily drowned out by laughter and heckling from the crowd when he tried to explain the reasoning for the order. One person called him a liar and disgusting, and some in the crowd started chanting “no more masks.” One public commenter even compared maskless children being excluded from activities to racial segregation. There are various exceptions to the proposed order, including youth with a medical condition, mental health condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering.\n\nKentucky\n\nPine Top: During a five-year span that ended last year, Kentucky State Police fatally shot at least 41 people – more than any other law enforcement agency in the commonwealth, according to a published report. Police declined to release the numbers, but the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting and the Marshall Project built a database using a combination of publicly available data and state police records, according to an article the entities published in partnership with the Lexington Herald-Leader. The report said Kentucky troopers killed more people in rural communities than any other department in the nation, according to the partnership’s analysis of data compiled by the Washington Post. None of the 41 fatal shootings resulted in troopers being prosecuted. Of those killed, about 75% were armed, and a majority were suffering from addiction or mental health problems, according to the investigation. Kentucky State Police investigate shootings with no outside oversight, a practice some experts and prosecutors say is problematic. “I don’t think it should be done,” said Dave Stengel, the former commonwealth’s attorney in Louisville. He said there is potential for conflicts of interest. “Everybody knows everybody else.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A civilian Pentagon official ordered the Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday to conduct a full environmental assessment of a $9.4 billion Formosa Plastics complex planned in the state, drawing praise from environmentalists. Jaime Pinkham, the Army’s acting assistant secretary for civil works, ordered the review after a virtual meeting with opponents of a Corps wetlands permit that allowed Formosa Plastics Group member FG LA LLC to build 10 chemical plants and four other major facilities on the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Critics praised the decision. “The Army Corps has finally heard our pleas and understands our pain. With God’s help, Formosa Plastics will soon pull out of our community,” said a statement by Sharon Lavigne, who founded the local group Rise St. James to fight the planned complex announced in 2018. Formosa, based in Taiwan, wants to produce polyethylene, polypropylene, polymer and ethylene glycol on 2,400 acres in St. James Parish. Dubbed the Sunshine Project because it’s near the Sunshine Bridge, the project is expected to provide 1,200 permanent jobs and up to 8,000 construction jobs, the state has said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Several music venues plan to require vaccinations for concertgoers. State Theater, Thompson’s Point and Portland House of Music are among those in the city requiring COVID-19 shots or a negative test for the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the Opera House at Boothbay Harbor and Stone Mountain Arts Center in Brownfield are also requiring proof of vaccination. The marquee sign above State Theater says: “Vaccines are a gateway drug to concerts.” “We hope we can keep our doors open, and we need your support and understanding to do so,” the Portland House of Music said. The announcements come amid a surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus, which now accounts for virtually all infections in Maine. Meanwhile, the University of Maine System is requiring all students, faculty, staff and visitors to wear wear face coverings inside its buildings. The new policy applies to all, regardless of vaccination status. “With our classrooms and other indoor spaces no longer set up to impose social distancing, face coverings are an important strategy we can employ to effectively control the transmission of COVID, regardless of an individual’s vaccination status and testing participation,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy wrote. Bates College has adopted a similar requirement at its Lewiston campus.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit against Shore Transit after the public transit agency refused to display PETA advertisements on its buses. The animal rights group applied to display two advertisements on Shore Transit buses in May 2020. Both advertisements read: “No One Needs to Kill to Eat. Close the slaughterhouses: Save the workers, their families, and the animals.” Shore Transit denied the application, saying the advertisements violated its advertising policy. The agency prohibits advertisements that are “political, controversial, offensive, objectionable or in poor taste,” according to the suit. However, PETA claims Shore Transit does not have any written guidance for following these terms. PETA alleges that by denying the application, Shore Transit violated the First and 14th Amendments. In July 2021, PETA renewed its application to advertise, and it says it has not received a response. PETA filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing PETA. The suit names Shore Transit, Shore Transit Director Brad Bellacicco and the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland as defendants. Shore Transit offers public transportation in Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than three centuries after a woman was wrongly convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death, she’s finally on the verge of being exonerated, thanks to a curious eighth grade civics class. State Sen. Diana DiZoglio, D-Methuen, has introduced legislation to clear the name of Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was condemned in 1693 at the height of the Salem Witch Trials but never executed. DiZoglio said she was inspired by sleuthing done by a group of 13- and 14-year-olds at North Andover Middle School. Civics teacher Carrie LaPierre’s students painstakingly researched Johnson and the steps that would need to be taken to make sure she was formally pardoned. “It is important that we work to correct history,” DiZoglio said Wednesday. “We will never be able to change what happened to these victims, but at the very least, we can set the record straight.” If lawmakers approve the measure, Johnson will be the last accused witch to be cleared, according to Witches of Massachusetts Bay, a group devoted to the history and lore of the 17th-century witch hunts. In the 328 years since a frenzy of Puritan injustice that began in 1692, dozens of suspects officially were cleared, including Johnson’s own mother, the daughter of a minister whose conviction eventually was reversed. But for some reason, Johnson’s name wasn’t included in various legislative attempts to set the record straight.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: In need of quick cash and find yourself in a forest? Well, you may have an opportunity on your hands. The state Department of Natural Resources is offering $75 for bushels of pine cones for the month of September. The agency is in need of these for replanting purposes, refilling forests with new conifer trees. But the DNR is requesting a specific kind of cone: the red pine cone, marked by its craggy, reddish bark and 4- to 6-inch needles that grow in pairs. The DNR notes that Scotch and Austrian pine cones will not be accepted. Scotch cones are marked by their flayed and thick bark, while Austrian cones are more orb-like than red cones. Cones should be picked off the tree, as fallen cones are usually too old or wet. And one can tell the age of the cone from the way the scales are arranged. The scales should be closed with a hint of green or purple. All brown and they’re too far gone. The correct kind of bag is being distributed at select DNR locations. The cones will be processed in machines that harvest their seeds, which will be used to replenish the in-high-demand red pine, among other initiatives to refill Michigan forests.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: A wildfire in the Superior National Forest that crews have been fighting since the weekend has grown to 61/ 4 square miles, but U.S. Forest Service officials said Thursday morning that it grew little overnight. The Forest Service said lightning caused the fire first spotted Sunday near Greenwood Lake, about 25 miles southwest of Isabella. It grew from 5 square miles to 61/ 4 by Wednesday evening, after what officials described as a “very active” afternoon of expansion on its western flank. But in an update posted Thursday morning, Forest Service officials said there was no significant change overnight, which is often the case with forest fires. Thursday’s forecast in the area called for continued hot, dry weather, with thunderstorms expected Friday night and Saturday. The fire led authorities to evacuate about 75 homes Monday near McDougal Lake, just north of where the fire started. Many dwellings in the area, which is deep in the forest, are seasonal cabins. Some small portions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the north and northeast have been closed as a precaution due to the blaze, and two smaller fires spotted over the weekend in the wilderness. No injuries or damage to structures has been reported. Crews are also fighting several smaller wildfires in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s only pediatric hospital is treating its largest number of COVID-19 cases so far during the pandemic, the hospital said Thursday. Children’s of Mississippi is part of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. “Today, Children’s of Mississippi and the University of Mississippi Medical Center reported 28 children with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, the highest number of pediatric COVID-19 patients at the state’s only children’s hospital since the beginning of the pandemic,” the hospital said on Facebook. “Of these hospitalized children, 100% are unvaccinated. This number includes eight children in the ICU, including five who are too young to receive the vaccine.” Meanwhile, state health officials say almost 1,000 hospital beds that could be used to treat patients during the latest surge of coronavirus are unstaffed because of a shortage of health care workers. Mississippi is facing a record number of people hospitalized with the virus – 1,633 on Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health – and has the highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case tracker.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two employees are suing Springfield Public Schools over the district’s mandatory racial equity training, which they contend violates their rights and is an “unconstitutional condition of employment.” The federal lawsuit was filed Wednesday by Jennifer Lumley, a records secretary for the special services department, and Brooke Henderson, who works on plans for students with disabilities. Henderson is a member of Back on Track America and has frequently accused the district of inserting critical race theory into its training. Critical race theory, which studies America’s history through the lens of racism, is not mentioned in the lawsuit. But the women allege the term “equity” and other phrases used during the training are code for the theory, which they contend conditions “individuals to see each other’s skin color first and foremost.” All employees were required to take the training during the 2020-21 school year or lose pay. As part of the training, they were required to commit to equity and becoming “anti-racist educators,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed against the district, its school board and four district officials. Stephen Hall, spokesman for the district, said the district is prepared to defend its equity efforts and is confident the court will find the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University and the University of Montana are telling everyone to wear masks indoors on campus. Montana State University President Waded Cruzado and University of Montana President Seth Bodnar both cited the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus as one reason for their requests and also urged people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Cruzado said Montana State’s decision would last through Oct. 1 but said in a message to students, staff and faculty that mandates “foment dissension and division.” She also said she understands people find pandemic-related mandates “odious,” and they require enforcement, so she is asking people to voluntarily wear their masks because it is the right thing to do. Bodnar also said UM is urging but not requiring masks, and he said the university will revisit its stance Sept. 20. He noted the uptick in cases in Missoula County had placed it in a “high risk” zone based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and he pointed to advice from health officials that says masks can help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials are dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak at a state correctional facility as coronavirus cases surge statewide. After 33 inmates tested positive for the virus at the Diagnostic and Evaluation Center in Lincoln, officials paused all visits and volunteer activities there and asked county jails to delay sending new inmates if they can. All adult men who enter the state prison system go through the facility. Officials said all inmates who test positive for the virus are being housed away from other inmates to limit the spread of COVID-19, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The state Department of Correctional Services has also started providing bars of soap, which inmates had to purchase before the pandemic, and masks to inmates who request them. Officials say they have also stepped up efforts to disinfect spaces where people live and congregate in prisons. Department Director Scott Frakes said the increase in cases in the prison system – which lists 36 active cases – follows an increase in the community. “It is not a surprise that we have an uptick in cases now, especially at DEC which serves as the intake facility for all male inmates who are new admits or returning to us from the community,” Frakes said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The U.S. debut of a long-established international food and beverage industry trade show could make Las Vegas a magnet for foodies and food product retailers, distributors and wholesalers, event producers and tourism officials said. An announcement Tuesday by Emerald Holding Inc. and Comexposium, owner of the SIAL brand of worldwide food shows, was timed as a topper to Emerald’s ongoing International Pizza Expo now at the Las Vegas Convention Center. “This partnership underscores the ever-increasing importance of creating a single event for the food industry,” Jessica Blue, Emerald executive vice president, said in a statement. SIAL, for Salon International de L’Alimentation, has a 50-year history and says it draws some 16,000 exhibitors and 700,000 visitors from 200 countries to 10 shows in France, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. “We plan to bring a new international food exhibition to life in Las Vegas to enable comprehensive sourcing of new products,” said Nicolas Trentesaux, SIAL Network Global CEO. The announcement hosted by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority puts the SIAL America show on the Convention Center schedule for March 2022.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A billionaire software company CEO has given a former hermit $180,000 to rebuild his cabin in a new location. Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, gave David Lidstone a personal check last week, Lidstone’s friend, Jodie Gedeon said on Facebook. A spokesperson for the data analytics software company confirmed the donation to the Concord Monitor. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the Monitor. “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” There has been an outpouring of support for Lidstone since he was jailed July 15 and accused of squatting for nearly 30 years on property owned by a Vermont man. His cabin burned down this month shortly before his release, but he recently secured temporary housing through the winter. The location is being kept secret to protect Lidstone’s privacy, Gedeon said. But supporters will have a chance to meet Lidstone at a “thank you” event in Warner, New Hampshire, on Saturday. Lidstone has said he doesn’t think he can go back to being a hermit. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: Huge gates that could be slammed shut when major storms approach would be built across the mouths of three inlets in New Jersey, closable barriers would cut parts of two bays in half, and 19,000 homes would be raised as part of a $16 billion plan to address back bay flooding, one of the major sources of storm damage at the Jersey Shore. After five years of study, federal and state officials unveiled recommendations Thursday that would drastically change the appearance of some iconic spots at the shore. It also would be one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. The term refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines. Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy. “To better protect New Jersey’s residents, communities, and economy, we must plan and prepare today for the climate change risks of tomorrow,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heard from industry officials Wednesday about what it will take to boost renewable energy development in the state and across the nation as the Biden administration pushes its initiatives to reduce emissions and address climate change. Developers and policy experts said without more transmission infrastructure and a cohesive grid, renewable energy will be stranded in remote spots like rural New Mexico, and opportunities for economic development will be hampered as a result. “This stuff is as important as building highways. It’s as important as building hospitals and schools,” said Fernando Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority. “The only way we’re going to accomplish this … is that we really do need a predictable regulatory landscape.” He and others told Granholm about permitting bottlenecks that have slowed the development of major transmission projects in New Mexico. They said if the Biden administration wants to reach its goals, the U.S. can’t afford to take decades to site and build transmission lines. A major line to connect wind farms in eastern New Mexico to the grid, for example, is almost complete but needs the approval of more than 430 easements from ranchers and other landowners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A group of restaurants asked a judge this week to block the city’s latest effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, calling the city’s mandate that customers show proof of vaccination “arbitrary, irrational, unscientific and unlawful.” The group argued that the new rules would severely harm their businesses and livelihood. The city’s proof-of-vaccination edict went into effect Tuesday and requires anyone dining indoors at restaurants, going to museums, attending concerts, working out at a gym or entering many indoor public venues show proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The group of restaurateurs that filed the lawsuit in Richmond County, which encompasses Staten Island, said restaurants and other establishments included in the city’s vaccine mandate were unfairly targeted because many other places such as grocery stores, hair salons, churches, schools and office buildings were excluded from the mandate. “This vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to the fact that it targets certain establishments but not others with no rational whatsoever,” the lawsuit says. Mayor Bill de Blasio first announced the new rules Aug. 3. He said enforcement won’t begin until Sept. 13 to give businesses more time to prepare and people an opportunity to get vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A college tradition has come under scrutiny after pictures the school posted on social media showed hundreds of students gathered at a campus landmark waiting to get a drink of water in the midst of a COVID-19 surge. Pictures posted to Twitter by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed a line of students approaching the Old Well on Wednesday waiting to get a drink and a picture. According to tradition, students who drink from the fountain at the well on the first day of classes will get good grades for the entire school year. It was first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh. The tradition was canceled last year because of the pandemic. The resumption brought a thread of negative reactions. “Tradition aside, you couldn’t just find a couple paper cups for this? In the middle of the fourth wave of a global pandemic?” said one response. “It would have been a great idea to put this tradition on hold,” said another response. According to the newspaper, the university issued a statement saying it had consulted with public health experts who agreed it was OK to proceed with the tradition since there is little to no evidence of surface transmission of the coronavirus. Students who chose to participate were encouraged to wear a mask and maintain distance while waiting in line.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There are no current plans to bring any of the people fleeing the conflict in Afghanistan to the state, officials said. The North Dakota Department of Human Services, who oversees the Refugee Resettlement Program, said the process is actually quite extensive. It takes eight different government agencies and six background checks for a person to gain clearance for the Refugee Resettlement Program in North Dakota, officials said. The state’s refugee coordinator said the people being transported to the U.S. are classified as Special Immigrant Visa Holders. Each person will be resettled in an area of the country in which Afghans have already settled, KXNET-TV reports. “There are strong communities that have already been set up for individuals that have a successful history of gaining employment, assimilating within the community, learning English and, you know, really developing successful relationships with a variety of different community members,” Holly Triska-Dally said. The Pentagon said that over the prior 24 hours about 2,000 people, including 325 American citizens, had been flown out of the Kabul international airport on 18 flights by U.S. Air Force C-17 transport planes.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Whether because of a lack of computer access, lack of awareness or mistrust, about 180,000 children in the state are not benefiting from the government’s enhanced Child Tax Credit program. That’s the conclusion drawn by Alex Coccia, a senior policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a national nonprofit organization. On a conference call with several members of local and national nonprofits this week, Coccia said that through the first two months of the program, 2.151 million Ohio children have received the tax credit’s advance payments, but he estimated that 2.33 million children are eligible. The monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child began in July and will continue through December, with another six months’ worth of money available upon filing a tax return in 2022. The payments go out automatically to the roughly 90% of eligible Americans who filed a tax return this year, but the concern is that the “non-filers” still may be unaware of the benefit. Those who do not file a tax return, because of very low incomes or several other reasons, must “opt in” through an online portal on the IRS website. And that’s where access issues begin. “We’re worried about non-English speakers, those who lack secure housing, and those with limited internet access,” Coccia said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s school districts should have “the autonomy” to enact mask requirements, which are banned by state law, according to the superintendent of schools. “School districts deserve the autonomy to enact policies that protect our schoolchildren and staff from COVID exposure and infection,” Oklahoma Superintendent Joy Hofmeister said in a statement Wednesday. Hofmeister’s comments came after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to her and Gov. Kevin Stitt that the ban may violate the American Rescue Plan Act that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom. Cardona sent similar letters to several other states with similar mask bans. Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. A spokesperson for Stitt told the Tulsa World on Wednesday that the governor had not yet seen the letter. Hofmeister, whose recommendation for a statewide mask mandate in schools was rejected in July 2020 in a 4-3 vote by the state Board of Education, said vaccinations and mask wearing are key to keeping schools open for in-person classes. “I think Ronald Reagan was right when he said those closest to the problem are the ones best suited to address it,” Hofmeister said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated Oregon resident and tribal citizen Charles F. “Chuck” Sams III to head the National Park Service. If confirmed by the Senate, Sams would be the first Native American to hold the position. He is Cayuse and Walla Walla and a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Sams has worked in state and tribal governments and the nonprofit natural resource and conservation management fields for over 25 years, White House officials said. “The diverse experience that Chuck brings to the National Park Service will be an incredible asset as we work to conserve and protect our national parks to make them more accessible for everyone,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release. “The outdoors are for everyone, and we have an obligation to protect them for generations to come.” Currently, Sams is a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, a role appointed by Gov. Kate Brown. The Democratic governor said in a statement Wednesday that it was a proud day for Oregon. She described Sams as a “passionate student and teacher of the history and culture of our lands and our people.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Mister Rogers’ deliveryman’s son, who’s now a real-life mail carrier, briefly appeared this week on an episode of a children’s show based on one of Mister Rogers’ puppets. Alex Newell, 39, is the son of David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Alex Newell had a cameo on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In Wednesday’s episode, Newell appears as a mail carrier ensuring a little girl’s care package has been delivered to a friend, according to the newspaper. David Newell said Rogers was the first person who came to visit him at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital after each of his three children were born, including Alex. “In a way, Alex grew up in Mister Rogers’ neighborhood, in reality and in pretend,” his dad said. “He watched the program as he was growing up, and now he’s making a delivery on (‘Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood’). And that makes me so proud.” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” features 4-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original show’s Daniel Striped Tiger.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The cost of running the city’s guaranteed-income pilot program will be more than the total of cash payments given to low-income families. The 110 households selected to take part in the pilot will receive $500 monthly, adding up to $6,000 over the course of the one-year experiment. In total, $660,000 will be given away in no-strings-attached cash grants. Meanwhile, expenses associated with administering the program and researching its effectiveness are already expected to top $723,000, according to an estimate provided by Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office. While that means that the total cost of the pilot program will exceed the $1.1 million that Elorza had originally anticipated, none of that is taxpayer money. The pilot program is being fully funded by private donors, including Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Joining a growing number of Democratic mayors nationwide, Elorza has championed the idea that a guaranteed income can help lift people out of poverty, pointing to Stockton, California, which found that many recipients used the money for basic needs and that they were more likely to be employed full time after taking part in the program. Providence is now encouraging anyone who makes less than 200% of the federal poverty level to apply before the Saturday deadline.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The Myrtle Beach International Airport has been the busiest airport in the Palmetto State this summer. The airport set a record for passenger traffic with more than 500,000 total passengers in July, WBTW-TV reports. That’s the highest monthly passenger count ever recorded at an airport in South Carolina’s history. Total passenger traffic for July totaled nearly 550,000 – a 49% increase over July 2019, airport officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of the South Dakota National Guard says Gov. Kristi Noem didn’t tell him she would use a private donation for the deployment to the U.S. border with Mexico until after the mission was already planned. Noem’s decision to accept a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire last month was met with hefty criticism from those who said it allowed a private donor to commandeer a military force. But Maj. Gen. Jeffery Marlette told a legislative budgeting committee Wednesday that the donation was not a factor in planning the deployment. “Our National Guard is not for hire,” he told lawmakers. “Nowhere in this planning process was there a discussion of, ‘I’ll go send the Guard if I can find somebody to pay for it.’ ” The Republican governor last month described the $1 million donation offer from billionaire Republican donor Willis Johnson as a “surprise” that came as she was deciding whether to send police officers or National Guard troops, as well as how to fund the deployment. The state was responding to a request from Texas and Arizona to send law enforcement officers under an agreement between states to assist during emergencies\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Hospitals warned Thursday that the intensive care units are full in nearly every hospital in the state’s major metropolitan areas, pleading with Tennesseans to get vaccinated and wear masks while not going so far as to criticize Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of mask mandates in K-12 schools. Meanwhile, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona warned Tennessee in a letter Wednesday that the order might violate federal law. The Tennessee Hospital Association said in its statement that the hospitals in metropolitan areas with full ICUs are the same ones that normally accept transfers from smaller hospitals of the sickest patients. “This means that if you or a loved one need treatment for any type of serious healthcare problem like a severe injury, heart attack, or stroke, you may not be able to access the care you need, when you need it,” the statement says. It cites Tennessee Department of Health data from May and July that found “at least 88% of these COVID hospitalizations and 94% of COVID deaths are among unvaccinated individuals.” And a Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine report released Thursday found hospitalizations have increased more than tenfold in a little more than a month, the fastest rate of increase of the pandemic.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Austin City Limits Music Festival announced plans Thursday to require a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all patrons attending the event, scheduled to take place Oct. 1-3 and 8-10 in Zilker Park. While the festival will still admit children 10 and younger for free with a ticketed adult, the popular Austin Kiddie Limits section of festival programming has been paused for the 2021 event. Families attending the festival will be required to provide a negative virus test result for unvaccinated children. The festival also has added a “fan health pledge” to the website. It requests that fans skip the festival if they have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus within 14 days of the beginning of the festival or if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 48 hours of the festival. It also requests that fans do not attend if they “have travelled to any international territory identified by federal or applicable state or local governments as being subject to travel or quarantine advisories due to COVID-19.” The move comes as Austin grapples with rising coronavirus hospitalizations in the area. Music venues and industry leaders have been trying to figure out how to increase safety measures right as large events return.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A teacher is no longer employed at a high school after a video of her sharing political opinions in class began circulating online, school district officials said Wednesday. The teacher at Lehi High School was initially placed on administrative leave after the video surfaced, but Alpine School District officials confirmed she no longer works there. District spokesman David Stephenson declined to say whether the teacher was fired or resigned. Video that appears to be surreptitiously recorded by a student in the classroom shows the teacher criticizing people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was shared online by conservative activists who have led demonstrations against mask mandates and vaccines throughout the state. “I don’t have to be happy about the fact that there’s kids coming in here with their variants that could possibly get me or my family sick,” the video showed the teacher saying. “That’s rude, and I’m not going to pretend like it’s not.” She can also be heard saying that most students are smarter than their parents and that they don’t need to believe everything their parents believe. The Alpine School District, which declined to identify the teacher, said in a statement that the district disavowed her comments.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: The state’s largest utility is reminding customers that they can apply for grant money to get caught up on past-due utility bills related to the pandemic. A total of $55 million in free grant money is available to help renters, homeowners, businesses and farms pay overdue utility bills tied to the pandemic, Green Mountain Power said in a statement Tuesday. “More than 20,000 GMP customers have fallen at least two months behind on their accounts during the pandemic, yet only about 2,000 have applied for these new assistance programs,” said Steve Costello, a GMP vice president. The Vermont Department of Public Service is taking grant applications through Oct. 25. The money, which does not have to be repaid, can go toward past-due landline phone, electric, natural gas and water service bills, the utility said.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A school board has voted to ignore state guidelines on protecting transgender students rather than change its policies as the law requires before the school year starts. The Newport News School Board voted 5-1 against the change with one member abstaining at a crowded meeting Tuesday, The Daily Press reports. Newport News is one of the largest districts in the state and among the first in Hampton Roads to refuse to follow the law passed last year. Under the law, school districts must adopt policies consistent with or more comprehensive than the model policies. They include allowing students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that conform to their gender identity and allowing students to use pronouns and a name that reflect their gender identity. Most board members said they wanted more information, citing their discomfort with parts of the guidelines. Before the vote, Chair Douglas Brown said there’s nothing stopping the district from spending more time on the matter before revisiting it. Still, Brown said the law violates the rights of Christian parents like him who believe kids aren’t capable of making choices about their gender.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say there are more people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state than at any time during the pandemic. Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association. said as of Thursday morning there were 1,240 people with the coronavirus in state hospitals. The previous highest number was about 1,100 in December. “Hospitals are still really, really full across the state,” Sauer said at a news conference. Hospitals are also seeing more people due to the effects of recent heat waves, smoke from wildfires and injuries due to summer activities. Sauer said until the recent uptick in cases and hospitalizations due to the delta variant, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the state had been holding steady at about 300 to 350 people. The numbers began increasing in early July and have been doubling about every two weeks. There has been a slight slowing in COVID-19 admissions recently, but Sauer said it’s too early to say if that’s a trend. To help free up capacity, Sauer said hospitals have been working with the state to move other patients who can be discharged into places like long-term care facilities. “We will have plenty of capacity if we can move patients out,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh toured an underground coal mine for the first time, joining U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin at a northern West Virginia facility Wednesday. Walsh did his best to signal that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration won’t be an enemy of the coal industry as he and Manchin visited American Consolidated Natural Resources’ Golden Ridge Portal Mine near Wheeling. “It was quite the experience, I’ll tell you that,” Walsh said in a telephone interview on his way back to Washington, D.C. He described donning the proper safety equipment, taking an elevator ride down to the mine, and then a mantrip ride by rail to the longwall to watch a machine grind and extract coal from the seam. Walsh’s agency oversees the Mine Safety and Health Administration as well as the administration of benefits for coal miners disabled by black lung disease. “I felt it was really important for me to go down and get a feel for what mine workers do,” Walsh said. “I have a different understanding and appreciation of the work.” Democratic candidates for president have struggled in recent years to connect with voters in West Virginia, in part due to a push toward clean energy under the Obama administration. Still, despite his promises, coal did not come roaring back under Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Dells: The Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park is building the nation’s first rotating waterslide as part of a $23 million expansion. The project includes a new 22,500-square-foot building attached to the indoor waterpark. The rotating waterslide, named Medusa’s Slidewheel, is a four-person raft ride that combines the rotation of a Ferris wheel with the propulsion of a waterslide, according to a news release from architecture and engineer firm Ramaker and Associates, which is working on the project. Outside the United States, the only other rotating waterslides are in China and Poland, the news release said. Mount Olympus announced the project on its Facebook page Aug. 6. Construction began in July and is scheduled to be completed by Memorial Day 2022. “It will be the coolest slide that ever hit the waterpark industry,” Mount Olympus CEO and owner Nick Laskaris told WiscNews. “Not just the Dells, but the industry as a whole.” In addition to Medusa’s Slidewheel, the indoor waterpark expansion project will include a large swimming pool area, Laskaris told WiscNews. The existing indoor waterpark will be remodeled to match the new addition, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Marijuana advocates plan to begin circulating petitions in September for two proposed ballot measures – one asking if the state should legalize medical marijuana, and the other if it should decriminalize pot. The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office this week approved the wording of the proposed questions. The Secretary of State’s Office has now begun the process of seeking bids for printing the petitions. The process ends Aug. 25. The Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws plans to begin gathering signatures on or soon after Sept. 1. “We’ll be hitting events, going door to door. We intend to get it all wrapped up by February,” Wyoming NORML Executive Director Bennett Sondeno said Wednesday. The group has a “big list” of Wyoming events where it plans to gather signatures in the next few months, Sondeno said. February is the deadline to submit enough valid signatures to the Wyoming secretary of state to get the measures before voters in the 2022 general election, Sondeno said. Wyoming is among a minority of states that don’t allow cannabis in some fashion.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}]}

Written and made public in 1951, the document states that “India, that is Bharat… shall be a Union of States”.\n\nHowever, the country’s name, like much of the contents of the constitution itself, has been “heavily debated” since India gained independence in 1947, The Independent said.\n\nThe name “India” traces its origins to the River Indus, which is now known as Sindhu. Similar names have been used to refer to the subcontinent, dating back to those used by Ancient Greek writers. The English form “India” gained prominence when the country was ruled by Britain from the late 18th century onwards.\n\nThe name “Bharat”, meanwhile, comes from ancient Puranic literature and can also be found in one of the two major epics of India – the Mahabharata, whose oldest sections date to around 400 BCE. In it, Indians are said to be descended from King Bharat, a mythical figure whom Hindus claim started the Indian race.\n\nSince coming to power, the Modi administration “has steadily chipped away at the legacies of former governments and leaders”, said The Independent, in a bid to “break away from the country’s colonial past”.\n\nOfficial landmarks and buildings of national importance have changed their names, and Modi has repeatedly said India has “left behind” its former rulers, Britain. Modi’s government has also changed Islamic place names relating to the Mughal empire that preceded British rule.\n\nIn 2015, New Delhi’s Aurangzeb Road, which was named after a Mughal king, was changed to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road after protests from Modi’s party leaders. Last year, the government also renamed a colonial-era avenue in the heart of New Delhi.\n\nThe prime minister also replaced a statue of King George V with one of Indian freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, under a canopy near India Gate – a memorial dedicated to Indian soldiers who fought for Britain in the First World War.\n\n“The country has got a new inspiration and energy. Today, we are leaving behind the past and adding colours to future images,” Modi said at the time.\n\n‘Mix of opposition and support’\n\nThe rumoured name change has been met “with a mix of opposition and enthusiastic support”, said The Guardian.\n\nShashi Tharoor, of the opposition Congress party, said on X: “I hope the government will not be so foolish as to completely dispense with ‘India’. We should continue to use both words rather than relinquish our claim to a name redolent of history, a name that is recognised around the world.”\n\nBJP President Jagat Prakash Nadda, meanwhile, retorted: “Why does the Congress have so much objection to every subject related to the honour and pride of the country? It is clear that Congress neither respects the country, nor the Constitution, nor the constitutional institutions.”\n\nFormer Test cricketer Virender Sehwag agreed, writing: “India is a name given by the British (and) it has been long overdue to get our original name ‘Bharat’ back.”", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans", "Rebekah Evans", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/europe/turkey-trkiye-united-nations-scli-intl/index.html", "title": "Turkey rebrands as 'Türkiye,' changing name at the United Nations ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTurkey is rebranding itself.\n\nThe country is now called “Türkiye” in the halls of the United Nations, who agreed to recognize the change on Wednesday after a request from Turkey’s government. The campaign to rebrand as Türkiye began in December.\n\n“The process we started under the leadership of our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in order to increase our country’s brand value is to be finalized,” Cavusoglu tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter addressed to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Cavusoglu wrote: “I would like to inform you that, in line with the Presidential Circular … dated December 2, 2021, on the use of the word ‘Türkiye’ in foreign languages and the subsequent branding strategy, the Government of the Republic of Turkiye, henceforth will start using ‘Türkiye’ to replace the words such as ‘Turkey,’ ‘Turkei’ and ‘Turquie’ that have been used in the past to refer to the ‘Republic of Turkiye.’”\n\nUN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric told CNN Thursday that the UN accepted the change, and it became effective as soon as they received the request and made sure that the document was legitimate, which was on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s not an issue, it’s not for us to accept or not accept,” Dujarric said. “Countries are free to choose the way they want to be named. It doesn’t happen every day but it’s not unusual that countries change their names.”\n\n“One that comes to the top of my head is Côte d’Ivoire, which used to be referred to in English as Ivory Coast and they requested Côte d’Ivoire,” the spokesman added.\n\nCavusoglu told state-run news agency Anadolu on Wednesday that by working with Turkey’s Directorate of Communications, which is affiliated with the President’s office, the government had been able to successfully lay the groundwork for the rebrand. “We have made it possible for the UN and other international organizations, and countries to see this change to using ‘Türkiye,’” he said.\n\nTurkey’s Director of Communication Fahrettin Altun posted a promotional video on Twitter Wednesday with the caption: #HelloTürkiye.", "authors": ["Mina Alsharif Hande Atay Alam Eliza Mackintosh", "Mina Alsharif", "Hande Atay Alam", "Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/12/columbus-day-indigenous-peoples-day-why-some-change-name/3932258002/", "title": "Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples Day? Why some change the ...", "text": "Across the country, states, cities and schools are observing Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day.\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landfall.\n\nThe notion of an Indigenous Peoples Day took root in 1977 but didn't gain traction until 2014 when Seattle and Minneapolis adopted resolutions to replace the holiday.\n\nFor many Americans, the second Monday in October is a celebration of Italian heritage and Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage to the Americas. But a growing number of cities, states and universities are abandoning ship and replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, also known as Native Americans Day.\n\nAt least eight states, 10 universities and more than 130 cities across 34 states now observe Indigenous Peoples Day as an alternative to the federally recognized Columbus Day, which they say glorifies the mistreatment and colonization of Native Americans.\n\nAlthough Italian explorer Christopher Columbus is often credited as being the \"discoverer\" of the New World, millions of people already inhabited the Americas, and the Vikings had reached North America nearly five centuries earlier. Columbus made four expeditions to the Caribbean and South America over two decades, enslaving and decimating local populations and opening the floodgates of European colonization.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wisconsin, home to 11 recognized tribes, became the most recent state to formally recognize Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\n“Through this executive order, we recognize and appreciate our tribal nations and Indigenous people and their resilience, wisdom, and the contributions they make to our state,\" Gov. Tony Evers said in a press release. “Native Americans in Wisconsin and throughout our country have suffered unjust treatment — often at the hands of our government — and today is about recognizing that Wisconsin would not be all that it is without Indigenous people.”\n\nColumbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day:What's open and closed on Monday?\n\nOn Thursday, Washington, D.C., voted to temporarily change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. If approved by the mayor, the act would go into effect immediately.\n\nOn Friday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a proclamation recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nMaine and New Mexico changed the name in April, and Vermont followed suit in May. Minnesota made the change in 2016, followed by Alaska in 2017 and North Carolina in 2018. South Dakota has been celebrating Native Americans Day since 1990.\n\n\"This isn’t a way to erase our history or erase what was done because we want to make sure what happened is taught. But the United States has a history of celebrating people that shouldn’t be celebrated. We shouldn’t celebrate people that have committed genocide,\" said Chicago organizer Anthony Tamez-Pochel.\n\nTamez-Pochel, who is Cree, Lakota, and black, serves as co-president of the Chi-Nations Youth Council, an organization that supports indigenous youth. Tamez-Pochel has been leading the charge to change the name of Columbus Day in Chicago. To draft the pending city ordinance, Tamez-Pochel and others worked with Indigenous youth and Caribbean communities that had been directly impacted by Columbus.\n\n\"For us to celebrate a man who’s done these horrible atrocities against indigenous people, to me, it’s a slap in the face. I understand where the Italian-American community is coming from, it gives them a chance to celebrate their heritage, but at the expense of another’s culture,\" Tamez-Pochel said. \"It’s wrong to spread false narratives of what actually happened. We have to start telling the truth, even in our schools.\"\n\nBut not everyone's on board. In May, a northern New Jersey town shut down a proposal to change the name. Many Italian-American heritage groups opposed the change, saying it was motivated by \"propaganda.\"\n\nIn April, Oklahoma, which is home to 39 recognized tribes, struck a compromise: Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, the only current governor in the U.S. enrolled as a member of a Native American tribe, signed a bill placing both holidays on the same day.\n\n\"It just gives us one opportunity to celebrate Columbus, but also the Indigenous people here in America,\" Stitt told the Associated Press at the time.\n\nSimilarly, Alabama observes \"American Indian Heritage Day\" along with Columbus Day. Some cities in New York, Connecticut, and Oklahoma also celebrate both holidays.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Day? New Jersey town votes to keep Columbus Day\n\nNative American Day:In South Dakota, it's not Columbus Day\n\nMany states celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day under a different name or date. California and Nevada celebrate Native Americans Day on the fourth Friday of September, and Tennessee celebrates American Indian Day on the fourth Monday of September.\n\nIn Hawaii, the same day is known as Discoverers' Day, in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands officially celebrates Virgin Islands-Puerto Rico Friendship Day, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands celebrates Commonwealth Cultural Day.\n\nColumbus Day celebrations date back to 1792, when New York City celebrated the 300th anniversary of Columbus’s landfall. It official became one of now 10 official federal holidays in the 1930s, but local municipalities and states have not always observed it. Even Columbus, Ohio, named for the explorer, did not observe the holiday last year, citing a lack of funding to give city employees both Veterans Day and Columbus Day off.\n\nOnly 21 states, plus American Samoa and Puerto Rico, actually give workers Columbus Day as a paid holiday, according to the Pew Research Center's review of state government data.\n\nThe notion of an Indigenous Peoples Day took root at an international conference on discrimination sponsored by the United Nations in 1977. In 1992, Berkeley, California, declared Oct. 12 as \"Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People\" and promoted programs in schools and museums on Native American culture.\n\nTwo years later, the United Nations declared Aug. 9 as International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples.\n\nBut the trend to replace Columbus Day really gained traction in 2014, when cities such as Seattle and Minneapolis adopted resolutions replacing the holiday. In the next few years, resolutions across the country took flight in dozens of places. Universities across the country—including Brown, Cornell, Drake, Syracuse, Minnesota State and more—have also joined the movement.\n\nThe 75th annual Columbus Day parade is scheduled to take place in Manhattan on Monday. The event celebrates the \"spirit of exploration, the struggles and triumphs of immigrants who helped build the United States, and the vibrant heritage and cultural wealth of the Italian-American community,\" according to the non-profit Columbus Citizens Foundation website.\n\nThe Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTamez-Pochel said he would be spending the holiday at a ribbon-cutting ceremony and celebration for a newly-built earthen mound along the Chicago River, an installation that pays homage to the ancestral practice of mound building.\n\nAccording to the Northwest Portage Walking Museum, which spearheaded the project, the serpent-shaped earthwork will be the first noted installation of an hybrid earthwork mound by an Indigenous artist in North America, since the founding of the United States.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/middleeast/turkey-name-change-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Turkey changed its name: populism, polls and a bird | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nThe nation of Turkey has had it with being associated with a large bird that is best known as a symbol of the North American Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nOn Thursday, the United Nations recognized the country’s rebranding to Turkiye, pronounced tur-key-yay, in a move Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said would “increase our country’s brand value.”\n\n“The main reason why Turkey is changing its name is to eliminate the association with the bird,” said Sinan Ulgen, Chairman of Istanbul-based think-tank EDAM. “But also, the term is used in colloquial language to denote failure.”\n\nFor President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is running for re-election next year, the new name expresses the “culture, civilization and values of the Turkish nation in the best way.”\n\nInternational organizations are now obliged to use the new name, but it won’t happen overnight for the broader public, Ulgen told CNN. “It will likely take many years for the broader international public to switch from Turkey to Turkiye.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time the nation has tried to change its name, he said. A similar attempt was made in the mid-1980s under Prime Minister Turgut Ozal but it never gained as much traction, he said.\n\nThere may be political motivations behind the move as Turks return to the polls next June amid a biting economic crisis.\n\nThis is “another strategy deployed by the Turkish government to reach out to the nationalist voters in a crucial year for Turkish politics,” said Francesco Siccardi, senior program manager at the Carnegie Europe think tank.\n\nThe timing of the name change is “crucial” to next year’s elections, he said. “The decision on the name change was announced last December, when President Erdogan was trailing in all opinion polls and the country was navigating one of the worst economic crises of the last 20 years.”\n\nErdogan’s position in the polls has dropped significantly over the years. Polls from late last year show support for the ruling AK party at around 31-33% according to Reuters, down from 42.6% during the 2018 parliamentary elections.\n\nUlgen however said the name change was more of a rebranding strategy to boost the country’s international standing rather than a pre-election stunt.\n\nTurkey’s foreign trade deficit climbed 98.5% year-on-year to $6.11 billion in April, Reuters reported, citing the Turkish Statistical Institute. Annual inflation jumped to 73.5% last month, a 22-year high.\n\nAnalysts say that at times of crisis, the president tends to resort to populist moves to deflect attention from problems at home. The economic turmoil, having already brought people into the streets, has been a headache for the government.\n\n“The new name will both distract the domestic audience from more concrete, pressing problems and offer President Erdogan another argument for his case for a stronger, more traditional Turkey,” said Siccardi.\n\nIn another populist move in 2020, Erdogan issued a decree to convert Istanbul’s historic Byzantine Hagia Sofia Museum into a mosque.\n\n“In the absence of concrete policies to handle the country’s economic and political problems, Erdogan seeks salvation in populist identity politics,” Political analyst Seren Korkmaz wrote of the move at the time. “He boosts Turkish nationalism and Islamism and targets opposition figures.”\n\nThe new name also holds symbolic value, having been adopted in 1923 after the new nation emerged from the ashes of WWI. Its adoption globally would “cement Erdogan’s place in Turkish history next to the republic’s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,” said Siccardi.\n\nThe digest\n\nWhite House says Biden’s view of Saudi Arabia as a ‘pariah’ unchanged ahead of possible trip\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that US President Joe Biden’s position on Saudi Arabia “still stands,” responding to a reporter’s question on whether the president considers the kingdom to be a “pariah” due to its alleged complicity in the killing of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\n\nBackground: As a presidential candidate, Biden vowed to turn the kingdom into a “pariah” and make it “pay the price” for Khashoggi’s killing. Upon taking office, he refrained from direct contact with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), choosing instead to interact with his father, King Salman.\n\nWhy it matters: The reiteration of Biden’s position comes amid reports that the president is planning a trip to the kingdom. MBS, who runs day to day affairs of the kingdom, has rebuffed US calls to raise oil production to tame inflation. Jean-Pierre said she had no presidential trips to preview. The White House on Thursday however took the rare step of recognizing the role played by MBS in extending a ceasefire in Yemen.\n\nLebanese spy chief plans visit to Syria over missing US reporter\n\nLebanon’s intelligence chief Major General Abbas Ibrahim said he will visit Syria to resume negotiations for the release of American journalist Austin Tice, who went missing a decade ago. The jumpstart in negotiations comes after a request from US officials.\n\nBackground: Austin Tice was a freelance journalist and a former US Marine. He disappeared while reporting in Syria in 2012. Ibrahim said that in past talks with Damascus on Tice, Syria had raised demands related to the withdrawal of US forces, a resumption of diplomatic relations, and the lifting of some US sanctions. Negotiations stopped at the end of former President Donald Trump’s term.\n\nWhy it matters: Washington said last year it would not normalize or upgrade relations with Syria because of what it describes as atrocities it inflicted on its people. Biden, who met Tice’s parents last month, needs a foreign policy win, especially after his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Biden’s overall approval rating stood at 41% last month, according to a CNN poll.\n\nIsrael tells UN nuclear watchdog it will take action against Iran if diplomacy fails\n\nIsrael will take action to block Iran’s nuclear program if diplomacy fails, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Raphael Grossi on Friday. “Prime Minister Bennett made it clear that while Israel prefers diplomacy in order to deny Iran the possibility of developing nuclear weapons, it reserves the right to self-defense and to action against Iran in order to block its nuclear program should the international community not succeed in the relevant time frame,” a statement from Bennett’s office said.\n\nBackground: Iran has increased its enriched uranium stockpile and is yet to provide answers for unexplained nuclear activities at three undeclared sites, according to two reports dated May 30 from the IAEA obtained by CNN. The only additional explanation offered by Iran at one of the suspected nuclear sites was “the possibility of an act of sabotage by a third party to contaminate the area. However, Iran has not provided any evidence to support this explanation,” the report stated.\n\nWhy it matters: Grossi’s snap visit to Tel Aviv comes ahead of the IAEA’s board of governors meeting in Vienna on Monday, where the US, UK, France, and Germany are set to seek a resolution focused on the need for Iran to fully cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog. The draft resolution will be in response to two reports obtained by CNN and given to IAEA member states on May 30, stating that Iran has yet to provide answers for unexplained nuclear activities at three undeclared sites.\n\nAround the region\n\n\"I think there is this special message of courage, a message of hope for not only women, but men and women all around the world.\" @Zar_Amir tells me how it felt to make history as the first Iranian woman to win best actress at #Cannes2022 pic.twitter.com/eklYMINLLw — Becky Anderson (@BeckyCNN) June 2, 2022\n\nWhen Iranian actress Zar Amir Ebrahimi fled her country in 2006 due to a leaked tape, she thought her career was over. But on Saturday she became the first Iranian to win the best actress award at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.\n\nEbrahimi rose to fame in her native Iran, but the crowning moment of her career at Cannes came while she was in exile, for a movie that was shot in Jordan.\n\nDirected by Iran-born Ali Abbasi, “Holy Spider” is based on the true story of a serial killer in the holy city of Mashad, Iran. It follows a journalist, Rahimi, as she covers the hunt for a construction worker who was a suspect in the murder of 16 sex workers.\n\nWinning the award “was just like a dream,” she told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Thursday.\n\nThe movie touches on the topic of patriarchy, which Rahimi hopes will send “a message of courage, a message of hope, for not only women, but men and women all around the world.”\n\nThe win has thrust her back into the limelight in Iran and has caused a backlash. The actress told CNN that she has received around 200 threats. “The problem is that they didn’t even watch this movie, and they are judging this movie, just from a trailer,” she said, attributing the reaction to the lack of freedom of expression in Iran.\n\nEbrahimi fled Iran for France in 2006 after a “private video” of hers leaked, fearing arrest and lashings from judicial authorities, she said. She had to start her career afresh “in a country where I knew no one.”\n\n“I had to run away from my country, from my home. I left my friends and family behind,” she told CNN. But she refused to let the scandal mar her career. “From exactly the day after that scandal happened to me, I just talked about cinema, I just thought that I am alive, and I need to work. And you know, I will be alive because I have cinema, because I love my work, because I love life.”\n\nEbrahimi said her next film will be shot in Australia. She has no plans to return to her homeland.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary\n\nWhat’s trending\n\n“All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love.” @POTUS is a champion for the human rights of #LGBTQI persons. #Pride2022 #YouAreIncluded pic.twitter.com/gdPPBDlHZH — U.S. Embassy Kuwait (@USEmbassyQ8) June 2, 2022\n\nKuwait: #American_Embassy\n\nA tweet to mark Pride Month by the US embassy in Kuwait has started a firestorm on social media, prompting the Gulf nation to summon a US diplomat.\n\n“All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love,” the embassy tweeted, in English and Arabic, on Thursday with an image of a pride flag. “@POTUS is a champion for the human rights of #LGBTQI persons. #Pride2022 #YouAreIncluded,” it said, referring to the US president.\n\nThe US embassies in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE posted similar tweets.\n\nThe Kuwaiti embassy late on Thursday summoned the US charge d’affaires on the back of the embassy’s “pro-gay rights post,” the state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.

Instead, she removed the term \"Plantations\" from state websites and documents.\n\nBut not all reaction was positive or full of surprise.\n\n\"The tiny state of Rhode Island announced that because some people are too stupid and too dense to understand that some words have several meanings, they will change the official name of their state,\" PJ Media wrote in a Facebook post with hundreds of sharesthat initially said the state had become the first to change its name.\n\nRaimondo acknowledges racist associations of 'plantation'\n\nWhile the official state name includes “Providence Plantations” in reference to the mainland colony founded by Roger Williams in 1636, Raimondo said the word’s ties to slavery and the painful images it conjures for Black Americans cannot be ignored.\n\n“That is a word that is associated with the ugliest institution that our country has ever had,” she said during a Monday afternoon news conference at Billy Taylor Park, in Mount Hope. “So I think it’s time, it’s past time, to get rid of it. You can be proud of Rhode Island, but don’t be proud of a word that represents the worst of what our nation had to offer.”\n\nFact check:Father of modern gynecology performed experiments on enslaved Black women\n\nResidents may have the opportunity to vote on an official change\n\nRhode Islanders had a chance to change the state’s name in 2010 when an initiative to remove the historically charged phrase appeared on a ballot. The measure did not pass. The General Assembly is pursuing bills to put the question back on this year’s ballot, and one has already passed in the state Senate.\n\nRaimondo said removing the phrase from her office’s official communications, including state employee paychecks and gubernatorial orders and citations, was the most she could do about the issue by executive order.\n\nActivists say the order is not enough\n\nThe action comes after weeks of protests in cities around the nation over police killings of African Americans and systemic racism in America.\n\nFact check:Police killed more unarmed Black men in 2019 than conservative activist claimed\n\nFaith Quinnea, a 16-year-old organizer of one recent protest, which turned out to be one of the largest in Rhode Island's history, said removing the word “plantations” from the state’s name is one of the changes protesters wanted to see. Her next project, she said, speaking from the podium at Monday’s news conference, is lobbying the state to add Black history to its educational curriculum.\n\nFact check:The Irish were indentured servants, not slaves\n\nBut some activists said they felt the executive order represented a superficial change made during a time when people are demanding sweeping, systemic reforms.\n\n“There’s so much more that needs to be changed that affects Black people,” said Amanda Toussaint, a young Providence-based organizer. “They need to defund the police.”\n\nFact check:Municipal taxpayers foot the bill for police brutality with interest-collecting bonds\n\nBlack Lives Matter Rhode Island organizer Mark Fisher said the importance of the move should not be overlooked, though.\n\n“It might seem small to the average person, the average non-Black person, but it’s huge in our community,” he said.\n\nRhode Island politicians want voters to decide\n\nIn a joint statement, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said they support placing a question about changing the state’s official name on the November ballot and in the meantime will remove the reference to “plantations” from all General Assembly documents. Mattiello was recently forced to backtrack on a statement he made during a radio interview that he wasn’t sure if “actual slavery” existed in Rhode Island.\n\nState House Republican Reps. Michael Chippendale and Blake Filippi said they disapproved of Raimondo’s use of an executive order, but agreed that the question about changing the official name should go to voters in November.\n\nWomazetta Jones, secretary of Rhode Island’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said during Monday’s news conference that it “blew her mind” the first time she looked down at her state paycheck to see the word “plantations.” She said she looked forward to it being removed.\n\n“The time has long since passed for our government and other systems to address the injustices that people of color face every single day,” she said.\n\nFact check:Southern Dems held up 1964 Civil Rights Act, set filibuster record at 60 days\n\nOur rating: True\n\nWe rate the claim that Rhode Island is making moves to change its official name to remove a racially insensitive term TRUE. The governor has removed the phrase \"Providence Plantations\" from official websites and state documents, and legislators agreed the question of changing the name should go to voters in the fall. For now, the state's full name, \"Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,\" has not officially changed.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been renamed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of Türkiye.\n\nThe Turkish government is now in the process of officially changing its internationally recognised name with the UN, which could be changed with a “simple notification to the UN registry”, Middle East Eye said.\n\nHowever, the letter “Ü”, which isn’t in the nominal Latin alphabet, “could be a problem”, said the news site. A possible solution could be “using ‘U’ instead of ‘Ü’ in the new name”.\n\nErdogan said that the decision to switch names “represents and expresses the culture, civilisation and values of the Turkish nation in the best way”, the BBC reported. But some have said the change is part of an effort to “distance the country’s links to the bird”, reported the Daily Mail, as well as the “dictionary definition of ‘something that fails badly’”.\n\n“The association with the bird genuinely annoys Erdogan and the people around him,” said Selim Koru, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “It’s not a surprise given the government’s sensitivity to how the country is perceived and fondness for nationalist rhetoric. That is at the centre of this policy as well.”\n\nTurkey is by no means the first country to change its name. Here are a few of the other notable “national rebrands”.\n\nRepublic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia\n\nThis one was not so much a rebrand as a way to end a three-decade diplomatic dispute with Greece. North Macedonia “finally assumed its place on the map of western Balkan nations” in 2019, reported The Guardian.\n\nAs the result of the name change the country could finally join Nato, “a long-held dream for the small, multi-ethnic country which only narrowly escaped civil war in 2001”.\n\nSuccessive Greek governments “insisted the landlocked state’s determination to be known as Macedonia implied territorial ambitions against the Greek region”, leading to Greece vetoing Macedonia’s membership of Nato in 2008.\n\nThe dispute dated back to the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 when Macedonia declared its independence, but Greece “objected to its new neighbour’s name”, the BBC said.\n\nBoth Northern Macedonia and northern Greece were part of the Roman province of Macedonia, both of which “claim the heritage of Alexander the Great two millennia earlier”, said the broadcaster.\n\nBut the name change ended the 27-year dispute, ultimately lifting Athens’s veto on the nation’s bid to join Nato, which it joined as the 30th ally in March 2020.\n\nKingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini\n\nTo celebrate the 50th birthday of Africa’s last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, the Kingdom of Swaziland became known as the Kingdom of Eswatini in April 2018.\n\nKing Mswati III had “long complained that people outside of Africa confused his country with Switzerland”, said National Geographic.\n\nAnd there is at least one similarity – Eswatini “is also landlocked and has some mountains”. The southern African nation is “much smaller, smaller than Wales, and located on the eastern border of South Africa, just south of Kruger National Park”.\n\nCzech Republic to Czechia\n\nThe country’s official name is still the Czech Republic, but “Czechia” became its shortened geographical name in July 2016.\n\nThe name was chosen by Czech leaders as a “one-word alternative name of their country” with the purpose of making it “easier for companies, politicians and sportsmen to use on products, name tags and sporting jerseys”, said The Guardian at the time.\n\nBut it’s fair to say that the new name hasn’t really caught on. At the time, critics of the name complained that it sounded “ugly”, while others said it was too close to Chechnya, “making it prone to confusion”, said the paper.\n\nCape Verde to Cabo Verde\n\nIn 2014 the nation made up of ten islands off the Western coast of Africa registered the new name of Cabo Verde with the UN. The move reverted the nation’s official moniker “back to its original Portuguese name”, according to National Geographic.\n\n“Portuguese explorers came upon the peninsula now called Cap-Vert, the westernmost peninsula in Africa and a Senegalese port, in 1444”. They then “christened it ‘Cabo Verde’, which means ‘green cape’”, before using “the same name for the islands to the west, which became the country of Cabo Verde”.\n\nThe name eventually became anglicised, which created problems with “cumbersome” translations when the country sent official diplomatic cables or created tourism brochures, said The Boston Globe.\n\nThe name change was also part of a national rebrand. “When you say United States, people think: powerful, of the economy, the country of invention, of dreams,” said Mario Lucio de Sousa, the minister of culture for Cape Verde in 2014. “When you talk about Cabo Verde, people think of sun, the beach, nice people, smiles, working people, but, as of now, something intangible.”\n\nUpper Volta to Burkina Faso\n\nA former French colony, the landlocked West African nation gained independence under the name Upper Volta in 1960. In 1984 it was renamed Burkina Faso by president Thomas Sankara, becoming one of a host of nations that renamed their country in an attempt to break from its colonial past.\n\n“We changed the name because Upper Volta was a colonial name not from us but from the French Government, and because we are more than just a location on the river Volta,” a spokesperson for the country’s Mission to the UN told The New York Times.​\n\nCorrection, 28 February 2022: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Czechia as a Balkan nation.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "Rebekah Evans", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/tech/twitter-gray-check-mark/index.html", "title": "Twitter briefly rolled out gray 'official' check marks. Then Elon Musk ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA new verification mark intended to better identify prominent Twitter accounts has instead become the latest source of chaos at the company under new owner Elon Musk.\n\nJust hours after the feature’s debut, Musk abruptly said Wednesday he had “killed” a new, gray verification badge designed to label government accounts, major brands and media outlets, adding to the turmoil at one of the world’s most influential social media companies.\n\nThe new badge, which consisted of a gray check mark and the word “Official” placed underneath account handles belonging to Twitter, the United Nations and media outlets including CNN, was first introduced on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe feature was created to differentiate “select” identity-verified accounts from the blue check marks that Twitter has said it will soon offer to paying users for $8 per month, tweeted Esther Crawford, a director of product management at the company.\n\nThe new badge began rolling out early Wednesday morning. But by late morning, users began noticing that the badge had vanished.\n\n“I just killed it,” Musk tweeted in response to a tweet about the disappearances. Musk added: “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”\n\nMinutes later, however, Crawford was forced to clarify what Musk meant.\n\n“The official label is still going out as part of the @TwitterBlue launch – we are just focusing on government and commercial entities to begin with,” Crawford tweeted. “What you saw him mention was the fact that we’re not focusing on giving individuals the ‘Official’ label right now.”\n\nDespite that, accounts including NASA, CNN and the UN had all been stripped of their “official” labels by Wednesday afternoon, fueling the confusion.\n\nThe real-time experiment highlights Musk’s improvisational management style, which he has applied liberally across the company in his initial weeks of ownership.\n\nIn recent days, Twitter and Musk have been met with widespread criticism over the company’s plan to change the meaning of the blue check mark away from identifying confirmed individuals, particularly public figures, toward a new meaning signifying that a user has paid for Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service.\n\nElection security experts warned of the likelihood that bad actors could pay for a blue check mark, then change their display names to impersonate government officials or other authoritative sources of information.\n\nAfter appearing to ready the feature for rollout over the weekend, Twitter later decided to delay the deployment until after the midterms, CNN has previously reported. Also over the weekend, Musk vowed that accounts caught engaging in undisclosed impersonation would be permanently banned without warning, reversing earlier promises that so-called “permabans” would be extremely rare.\n\nTwitter said Tuesday evening that to resolve ambiguity about which accounts on its platform have been identity-verified — as opposed to those simply paying $8 a month for a blue check mark on their profiles — the company would introduce the gray check mark as part of an “official” label.\n\nAn earlier screenshot posted by Crawford showed how the new label would appear. The screenshot displayed Twitter’s own account profile, which included the standard blue check mark beside its display name as well as a gray check mark and the word “Official” underneath its account handle.\n\n“Not all previously verified accounts will get the ‘Official’ label and the label is not available for purchase,” Crawford tweeted on Tuesday. “Accounts that will receive it include government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.”\n\nCrawford also confirmed that the forthcoming option to pay for a blue check mark will not include an identity verification requirement.\n\n“We’ll continue to experiment with ways to differentiate between account types,” Crawford said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/12/17/macedonia-greece-name-change-globalpost/77468798/", "title": "Macedonia may change name to settle bad blood with Greece", "text": "Dan Peleschuk\n\nGlobalPost\n\nIf all politics is compromise, then Macedonia may be giving Greece a freebie.\n\nIts prime minister told the Guardian on Wednesday the Balkan country of around 2 million could potentially change its name to patch up a 20-year-old dispute between the two European neighbors.\n\nThat should suit Greece just fine.\n\nSince the breakup of Yugoslavia, of which Macedonia was a member, Athens has taken issue with its neighbor’s name, which it claims was swiped from a historical northern region in Greece. Greek officials also believe Macedonia, which is home to a majority Slavic population, is passing off elements of Greek culture and history as its own.\n\nAthens has gotten so riled up that it’s even blocked Macedonia from joining the European Union by using its veto power over new members.\n\nThanks to the long-running squabble, Macedonia is still formally known in international diplomatic circles — like in the United Nations — by its provisional name: the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).\n\nBut now, the bad blood between the two may finally be coming to an end.\n\nThe republic’s name-change discussions have previously included the idea of adding \"new\" or \"upper,\" the Guardian reported.\n\nThe Macedonian public would still have to approve of any name change through a popular referendum.\n\nMacedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki is expected to discuss the issue with Greek officials on Thursday during his visit to Athens, reportedly the first such trip in 15 years.\n\nHe told a Greek newspaper “conditions are more than ripe” for talks on the matter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost.

The company is encouraging its competitors to make the same offer.\n\nTaser, which was founded in 1993, is also officially changing its name to Axon, the name of its signature body camera. The change reflects the variety of technology it offers, which has grown beyond the original stun guns for which it is named, officials said.\n\nThe offer includes the use of an \"Axon Body 2\" camera and license to use the company's evidence-collecting website, which can store and organize video from multiple officers and other information pertinent to a criminal case.\n\nRead more:\n\nAll Louisiana troopers to wear body cameras\n\nBody cam captures dramatic rescue from burning car\n\nThe Axon Body 2 chest-mounted cameras retail for about $400, and licensing for the website and data storage can cost $15 to $90 a month depending on the features a police department wants to activate, the company said.\n\nThe company earns more revenue in the long run from managing the substantial quantities of data collected by the cameras than from the hardware itself.\n\n\"The offer is legitimate,\" company founder and CEO Rick Smith said. \"There is zero cost. Agencies can try this with all their officers and not pay us a dime.\"\n\nBody-camera sales grow across country\n\nSmith said the company's offer will allow officers to do their job more effectively and reduce the amount of time officers spend filling out police reports. The cameras collect an \"impartial\" record, he said.\n\nThe company's camera line was launched in 2008, but interest spiked after a series of high-profile police shootings, including the death of an unarmed man in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 and fatal shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota in 2016. Those events were followed by protests and then shootings of police officers, including two killed in New York in 2014 and five in Dallas in 2016, in which the gunmen said they acted in retaliation for police shootings.\n\n\"Tension between the police and the public is at historic levels,\" Smith said. \"I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime ... In that environment of distrust, body cameras make a huge difference. Police officers have proof of what they were facing when they did what they did.\"\n\nAxon, which reported a profit of $17.3 million last year, still sells more Taser weapons than body cameras, but body-camera sales are growing much faster. The company reported it sold about $203 million in Taser weapons last year, up 25% from 2015. It sold about $66 million in Axon equipment and software licenses in 2016, up 85% year over year.\n\nAxon: Test our equipment in the field\n\nAxon's sales team has been aggressively marketing its body-worn camera technology and its digital-storage systems to local governments, often in fierce competition with other providers.\n\nIts new marketing tactic looks to sidestep the traditional procurement process in many cities, where major buying decisions are made by city finance departments.\n\nAxon executives say using their devices in field trials is the best way to judge how well the system works.\n\nSmith said his company wins \"nearly 100%\" of public bidding processes where officers actually test the equipment.\n\nHe expressed frustration that bidding procedures often don't put the best equipment in officers' hands.\n\n\"Everyone who sells to the government has lobbyists and procurement specialists,\" he said. \"Police officers will tell you the technology they have at work is awful and has a horrible user experience. The way companies win government contracts has been who can navigate the purchasing bureaucracy. We think that is something that has to change.\"\n\n\"We've got to help our customers get to field trials so that they are actually deploying our products in the field,\" Smith told investors during a February teleconference. \"That is where the game changes ... You can't buy sophisticated technology with procurement processes that were built 20 to 30 years ago for buying belts and holsters and that sort of stuff.\"\n\nControversy in Phoenix bidding process\n\nWednesday’s offer is an expanded version of one company officials made earlier this year to big-city police departments.\n\nIn Phoenix, the proposal was not well received. Taser already had been disqualified from a bid process after its employees improperly reached out to city officials. The offer letter for free cameras, which was sent in January to Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams, was seen by Phoenix officials as an unethical attempt to circumvent the process.\n\n“The offer, if accepted, would undermine our procurement system and seriously damage its credibility,” Phoenix City Attorney Brad Holm responded to Taser in a February letter. “Please refrain from submitting anything similar to the offer again.”\n\nAt least one of Taser’s body-camera rivals sued the company earlier this year as a result of its aggressive lobbying.\n\nVieVu, the company that outfits Phoenix officers with body cameras for a pilot program, had won a lucrative contract with the city late last year. That deal was scrapped, and city officials said a rebid was planned to allow Williams, the new Phoenix police chief, a say in the process. Attorneys for VieVu say Taser is to blame, alleging improper communications between Taser and Phoenix officials.\n\nTaser filed a countersuit, claiming that VieVu had won the initial bid based on false advertising claims.\n\nDominant provider in region's market\n\nAxon’s body cameras have a stronghold in the Phoenix area, with the company's client roster including Mesa, Scottsdale, Chandler, Glendale, Peoria, Tempe and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAxon also has high-profile customers across the country. The company reports that it already serves 36 of the 68 largest police departments in the nation with cameras, including the Los Angeles Police Department, its largest domestic customer.\n\nIn October, the company announced 22,000 members of the London Metropolitan Police would use its body cameras after a trial period, making the city in Great Britain the largest Axon customer.\n\nJoaquin Enriquez, a public-information officer at the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, said deputies' experiences with the product have been generally positive.\n\n“Overall feedback is that video is good, the system is user-friendly and for the most part the audio is really good as well,” he said.\n\nPolice reports of the future: Mostly video?\n\nAxon officials predict case files increasingly will move away from handwritten or typed reports to collections of video that can be annotated, shared with prosecuting attorneys and redacted for privacy concerns.\n\nAxon recently acquired artificial-intelligence developers to help facilitate the move to video records that can easily be managed.\n\nSmith said the process will save officers time, allowing them to spend more of their workday in the community.\n\n\"All this time police are spending writing reports is fairly useless,\" he said. \"When you have a critical case, nobody believes the report anyways.\"\n\nFollow Ryan Randazzo and Megan Cassidy on Twitter: @utilityreporter and @meganrcassidy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/05"}]}

The discovery of palisades suggests the settlement was fortified with thousands of spiked planks used as defensive barricades, but archaeologists are unsure why it was needed by villagers.\n\nResearchers estimate that roughly 100,000 spikes were driven into the bottom of the lake off Lin, with Hafner calling the discovery \"a real treasure trove for research,” AFP reported.\n\nAccording to archaeologists who spoke with AFP, it will take another two decades for the settlement to be fully explored and studied and for final conclusions to be drawn.\n\nMore:Maui bird conservationist fights off wildfire to save rare, near extinct Hawaiian species", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/28/ram-skulls-ancient-egypt-ramses/11549565002/", "title": "2,000 ram skulls found in Egypt pharaoh Ramses II's ancient temple", "text": "More than 2,000 decomposed ram skulls unearthed in a newly discovered warehouse in the temple of the ancient pharaoh Ramses II will help archeologists uncover more details about one of the oldest Egyptian cities and its leader.\n\nIn an announcement Saturday, Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said a mission led by the New York University’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World discovered the skulls while excavating near the northern precinct of the temple in Abydos, about 270 miles south of Cairo.\n\nThe sacred city of Abydos is one of the oldest and most important sites of ancient Egypt, according to the World Monuments Fund, which works to conserve key structures in partnership with the Egyptian antiquities ministry and the American Research Center in Egypt.\n\n\"With its valuable inscriptions and numerous funerary monuments, Abydos has perhaps contributed more than any other site in Egypt to our present understanding of the history of state formation, linguistic development, and architecture in Ancient Egypt,\" the World Monuments Fund said.\n\nThe large number of embellished rams, among other discoveries, could provide insight into the life and history of this ancient temple, which was first discovered more than 150 years ago, according to the statement.\n\nArcheologists found the remains of a number of animals, including goats, dogs, cows, deer and an ostrich, perched beside the rams’ heads, according to the statement.\n\nDr. Sameh Iskander, head of the mission, told CBS News that rams' heads were \"obviously offerings that were made to the temple of Ramses during the Ptolemaic period, which shows even 1,000 years after Ramses II, that he was still revered.\"\n\nSome of the heads were still mummified, while \"others could have been mummified, but the wrappings or the covers of mummifications were not there anymore,\" Iskander told CBS.\n\nThe team also found parts of statues, hills, remains of ancient trees, clothing and leather shoes.\n\nRams were known to be worshiped at an “unprecedented level” in Abydus during Ramses II’s ruling, but the discovery suggests the animals remained significant because skulls were left there a millennium after the pharaoh's rule, the statement said.\n\nThe architecture of the newly discovered building is “distinctive and unique” and will contribute to researchers’ understanding of the city, the statement said.\n\nWho was Ramses II?\n\nAccording to the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, Ramses II, commonly known as “Ramses the Great,\" is one of the most famous Egyptian pharaohs.

Ceren Kabukcu\n\nAt Shanidar Cave, the researchers studied plant remains from 70,000 years ago, when the space was inhabited by Neanderthals, an extinct species of human, and 40,000 years ago, when it was home to early modern humans (Homo sapiens).\n\nThe charred food remains from Franchthi Cave dated from 12,000 years ago, when it was also occupied by hunter-gatherer Homo sapiens.\n\nDespite the distance in time and space, similar plants and cooking techniques were identified at both sites — possibly suggesting a shared culinary tradition, said the study’s lead author Dr. Ceren Kabukcu, an archaeobotanical scientist at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom.\n\nBased on the food remains researchers analyzed, Neanderthals, the heavy-browed hominins who disappeared about 40,000 years ago, and Homo sapiens appeared to use similar ingredients and techniques, she added, although wild mustard was only found at Shanidar Cave dating back to when it was occupied by Homo sapiens.\n\nEarly processed food\n\nA breadlike substance was found at the Greek cave, although it wasn’t clear what it was made from. The evidence that ancient humans pounded and soaked pulses at Shanidar Cave 70,000 years ago is the earliest direct evidence outside Africa of the processing of plants for food, according to Kabukcu.\n\nKabukcu said she was surprised to find that prehistoric people were combining plant ingredients in this way, an indication that flavor was clearly important. She had expected to find only starchy plants like roots and tubers, which on face value appear to be more nutritious and are easier to prepare.\n\nMuch research on prehistoric diets has focused on whether early humans were predominantly meat eaters, but Kabukcu said it was clear they weren’t just chomping on woolly mammoth steaks. Our ancient ancestors ate a varied diet depending on where they lived, and this likely included a wide range of plants.\n\nA Neanderthal hearth was unearthed at Shanidar Cave, where charred plant remains were also found. Graeme Barker\n\nSuch creative cooking techniques were once thought to have emerged only with the shift from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to humans’ focus on agriculture — known as the Neolithic transition — that took place between 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.\n\nWhat’s more, she said, the research suggested life in the Stone Age was not just a brutal fight to survive, at least at these two sites, and that prehistoric humans selectively foraged a variety of different plants and understood their different flavor profiles.\n\nJohn McNabb, a professor at the Centre for the Archaeology of Human Origins at the University of Southampton in the UK said that scientific understanding of the Neanderthal diet has changed significantly “as we move away from the idea of them just consuming huge quantities of hunted game meat.”\n\n“More data is needed from Shanidar, but if these results are supported then Neanderthals were eating pulses and some species from the grass family that required careful preparation before consumption. Sophisticated techniques of food preparation had a much deeper history than previously thought,” McNabb, who wasn’t involved in the research, said via email.\n\n“Even more intriguing is the possibility that they did not deliberately extract all the unpalatable toxins. Some were left in the food, as the presence of seed coatings suggests — that part of the seed where the bitterness is especially located. A Neanderthal flavor of choice.”\n\nPrehistoric microbiomes tracked\n\nA separate study into prehistoric diets that also published Tuesday analyzed ancient humans’ oral microbiome — fungi, bacteria and viruses that reside in the mouth — by using ancient DNA from dental plaque.\n\nResearchers led by Andrea Quagliariello, a postdoctoral research fellow in comparative biomedicine and food at the University of Padua in Italy, examined the oral microbiomes of 76 individuals who lived in prehistoric Italy over a period of 30,000 years, as well as microscopic food remains found in calcified plaque.\n\nA human jawbone was excavated from a Neolithic site in southern Italy. Andrea Quagliariello\n\nQuagliariello and his team were able to identify trends in diet and cooking techniques, such as the introduction of fermentation and milk, and a shift to a greater reliance on carbohydrates associated with an agriculture-based diet.\n\nMcNabb said it was impressive that researchers had been able chart changes over such a long period of time.\n\n“What the study also does is support the growing idea that the Neolithic was not the sudden arrival of new subsistence practices and new cultures as it was once thought to be. It appears to be a slower transition,” McNabb, who wasn’t involved in the study, said via email.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/12/17/we-found-lunas-colony/77449884/", "title": "Luna's colony unearthed in Pensacola", "text": "Thomas St. Myer\n\ntstmyer@pnj.com\n\nMobile users: Visit PNJ.com on a desktop browser for galleries, timelines and more.\n\nThe search is over. The longstanding mystery is solved. The location of the oldest established European multi-year settlement in the United States is indeed in the heart of Pensacola.\n\nDiscoveries by local historian Tom Garner in October and research afterward by University of West Florida archaeologists confirmed where Don Tristan de Luna established his Spanish colony in August 1559 – six years before the St. Augustine settlement and nearly 48 years before the English settled in Jamestown, Va.\n\nThe historical site is in an urban downtown neighborhood within view of the two shipwrecks linked to the Luna expedition in Pensacola Bay. UWF declined to reveal the exact location to protect the neighborhood and integrity of the site.\n\n“This is one of those almost once-in-a-lifetime type things,” said John Worth, associate professor of historical archaeology in the UWF Department of Anthropology and a 16th Century Spanish historian. “I figured if the Luna colony would be found it would probably be found accidentally. I did not expect it would occur during my tenure here necessarily. I just figured eventually we might find it, somebody would. I guess this is the culmination. I didn’t even hope to find it as much as just wish.”\n\nGarner initially discovered a half rim of a mid-16th century olive jar that surfaced after a house was bulldozed on a privately owned residential lot. He reported his discovery to UWF Archaeology lab director Jan Lloyd, and after multiple visits and surface collections, he brought the artifacts to the UWF lab Oct. 30 to be examined by the nationally renowned Worth and other UWF archaeologists.\n\nWorth confirmed what Garner suspected when he identified about 40 sherds as those from the Spanish colonial olive jar. The property owners then granted the university a five-day window, Nov. 6-10, to excavate about half an acre of land before construction of their new home commenced. The archaeologists and students conducted 69 shovel tests and discovered sherds of ceramics such as cookware, tableware and olive jars undisturbed beneath the ground surface. Small personal items they uncovered included a copper lacing aglet, lead fishing line weight, spike fragments, a wrought iron nail and five Indian trade beads from Venice.\n\nThe artifacts left no doubt in their minds that Garner found where Luna and about 1,500 other people settled in 1559 in Pensacola.\n\n“Bottom line is we found Luna’s colony,” Worth said. “It’s not a little bit of evidence. It’s a lot. It’s a substantial bull’s-eye in the archaeological landscape of Pensacola. There had been nothing found in the way of mid-16th century ceramics, which is exactly what you’d expect. It’s garbage. There were 1,500 people there trying to eke out an existence for about a two-year period.\n\n“… I’ve read every document that has ever been found, found a few myself, every single textual description was in my mind when I walked out on this spot, and it all fit perfectly. I had long thought it was a probability, but I had never been to the site, so Tom’s discovery brought me to the site and I walked out and literally it was like every single description in there was describing that precise point. The evidence is now substantial. We now have something on the order of a couple hundred sherds of this particular type of olive jar. That’s exactly what you’d expect for a colonial site, not just a temporary camp.”\n\nWorth said the only earlier European habitation site positively identified by archeologists in the Southeast occurred in Tallahassee. Hernando de Soto led a Spanish exploratory expedition that camped there in the winter of 1539 to early 1540. Juan Ponce de Leon, near Fort Myers in 1521, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon, near Brunswick, Ga., in 1526, attempted unsuccessfully to establish sustaining Spanish settlements. Those documented exploratory expeditions only lasted a few weeks and are yet to be discovered.\n\nThe location of the Luna colony surfaces nearly 10 years after UWF discovered the second shipwreck, Emanuel Point II, in 2006. The Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research discovered the first, Emanuel Point I, in 1992. UWF is currently excavating the second ship, and the artifacts at the terrestrial site are consistent with materials found in the shipwrecks in Pensacola Bay.\n\n“We’re getting pottery that matches chemically with what’s on the shipwreck,” Garner said.\n\nWorth said the Viceroy of New Spain sent the fleet from modern-day Mexico to establish the Atlantic coast of Florida, then push inland to Coosa and finally to Santa Elena on the South Carolina coast. The colony lasted from 1559-61 and included 550 Spanish soldiers, about 200 Aztecs and an unknown number of African slaves.\n\nA hurricane struck the colony just five weeks after the 1,500 or so people settled in Pensacola and wiped out the six ships carrying their supplies.\n\n“They were stranded. It took them months to get supplies. The first relief of expedition didn’t show up until December, so Luna all of the sudden had too many mouths to feed,” Worth said. “There were not enough Native Americans in the area to even remotely provide food, and by that time, when they didn’t want to be seen they didn’t get seen.”\n\nHistorical significance of the discovered shipwrecks is extraordinary. Worth said they provide tremendous insight into the nature of machinery that settlers traveled to the new world in, and the artifacts on those ships reveal what they brought from Spain.\n\nKnowledge of where they lived, though, presents archaeologists an incredible opportunity to discover who occupied the land and how they survived. Worth said research indicates the settlers moved inland into Alabama for about six months in search of food, but they returned after Native Americans ran off with their food.\n\n“Nobody’s ever found that site (in Alabama), although now that we know what we’re looking for, I think it should turn up,” he said.\n\nWorth considers the Luna colony (Santa Maria de Ochuse) to be the fourth and final significant Spanish settlement in Pensacola along with the Naval Air Station in 1698 (Presidio Santa Maria de Galve), Fort Pickens area in 1722 (Presidio Isla de Santa Rosa) and downtown Pensacola in 1754 (Presidio San Miguel de Panzacola).\n\nThe exact size of the Luna colony is unknown. Worth predicts the site will be multiple city blocks.\n\nElizabeth Benchley, director of the UWF division of Anthropology and Archaeology and of the Archaeology Institute, said access to the site is dependent on the neighborhood residents.\n\nUWF officials met with about 100 of the residents Wednesday night to reveal the historic significance of what they discovered and a desire to explore the neighborhood without disrupting their lives. The crowd responded enthusiastically to the news, and all six of the neighbors that spoke to the News Journal said they will permit UWF archaeologists to examine their property.\n\nIf neighbors grant his crew the access he covets, Worth said a significant portion of a 10-week archaeological field school this summer will be spent testing and excavating at the site. Worth and a small crew of students and staff will periodically check on the site and conduct small-scale projects in the spring semester, too. The collected artifacts will be curated in the archaeological lab.\n\n“All we have is the things that people made and left in the ground or disturbed in the ground, and from that is how we reconstruct these past cultures,” Worth said. “To me, one of the best things we could find are intact walls that bound interior and exterior and other things like that, that’ll give us clues to literally daily life inside one of these colony houses.”\n\nWorth is already clearing his next few summers to explore the oldest established European multi-year settlement. He said, “Wow” about a half dozen times when he first laid eyes on the artifacts collected by Garner on Oct. 30. The historical significance of the discovery still blows his mind two-and-a-half weeks later.\n\n“Every time I think about it deep, I get really excited,” Worth said. “It’s hard to believe this opportunity, this window, this site is finally here. Now not only do we have it, but we get to explore it.”\n\nChapter 2: Years of research - and a little luck - lead to discovery\n\nLocal historian Tom Garner read the translated version of \"The Luna Papers\" long ago and identified an urban downtown Pensacola neighborhood as one of the possible places Don Tristan de Luna established his colony from 1559-1561. Its close proximity to the two shipwrecks linked to the Luna expedition in Pensacola Bay only heightened his suspicion.\n\nGarner drove through that neighborhood on a fateful Oct. 2 afternoon when he noticed an unusual site that prompted him to step on the brake.\n\n\"There was ground disturbed, so I – I think all archaeologists are nosy – see this ground that's been exposed and it's in a good spot, a likely candidate for the settlement for decades, and the ship wrecks are close by, so I thought, 'Well, I need to look at that lot,'\" Garner said. \"Then another part of me goes, 'I don't want to look at that lot.' I've got stuff to do, right? But I thought, 'No, I've got to look at the lot.'\n\nGarner walked over to the privately owned lot, where a bulldozed house once stood, and spotted what to an untrained eye amounted to garbage – a half rim of an olive jar.\n\nBut Garner knew better.\n\nTom Garner with assorted pottery sherds he originally found on the surface of the Luna settlement, including Spanish olive jar, lead glazed coarse earthenware, majolica, and incised and plain Native American pottery. Special to the News Journal\n\nNorman Simons, the deceased former curator of the Pensacola Historical Museum in Old Christ Church and later the first curator of the T. T. Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum, taught Garner how to identify artifacts, and in 1983, Garner attended an archaeology field school at the University of West Florida. Judy Bense, UWF president since 2008, taught the class in which he learned professional archaeological methods.\n\nGarner immediately identified the sherd as that of a mid-16th century olive jar, and he contacted the UWF Archaeology Institute about his discovery. UWF then sought permission from the property owners to further investigate the property.\n\nThe curious Garner returned to the lot three weeks later and found the olive jar rim undisturbed. He conducted a surface collection and discovered a large fragment of mid-16th century Columbia Plain majolica pottery.\n\nConfident he found the Luna colony site, Garner proceeded to conduct another three surface collections over the next week and discovered Spanish colonial and Native American artifacts. He brought his findings to the archaeological institute Oct. 30 to be examined by John Worth, associate professor of historical archaeology, Jan Lloyd, director of the archaeological lab, and Elizabeth Benchley, director of the division of anthropology and archaeology and director of the Archaeology Institute.\n\n\"What we saw in front of us in the lab that day was an amazing assemblage of mid-16th century Spanish colonial period artifacts,\" said Worth, a renowned archaeologist and a 16th century historian of Spanish colonies in the Southeast. \"These items were very specific to this time period. The university conducted fieldwork at this site in the mid-1980s, as have others since then, but no one had ever found diagnostics of the sort that Tom found on the surface. People have looked for this site for a long time.\"\n\nGarner described Worth's reaction as he examined the artifacts as priceless.\n\n\"We lay the artifacts on trays and John comes in and he sits down and he looks at them, and he's like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah' and after two or three minutes of looking at it and holding pieces and 'yeah, that's right,' he says 'Holy-moly,'\" Garner said. \"That was his exact quote, which I think is the best description of any archaeology site I've ever heard. There were quite a few 'Wows' thrown in there as well over the next half hour or so.\"\n\nGarner drove through the neighborhood at an opportune time with the property owners transitioning from tearing down a structure to building their new home.\n\nWorth said confirming access with the property owners proved challenging. The wife had a baby during that time period.\n\nUWF archaeologists and students arrived four consecutive days at the facility dressed for the field and anxiously waiting for the property owners to agree to the excavation.\n\n\"Every day it was like, 'Have we heard?' 'No we haven't heard.' There was an email chain going, about a hundred emails, and texting all day long just trying to find out if we could go out,\" said Patty McMahon, a UWF grad assistant and the field director.\n\nWorth received the long-awaited call from the property owners at 10 a.m. Nov. 6, and he and his crew rushed over to the site within an hour. The first shovel test popped up another rim and once they dug under the surface top soil they found an abundance of mid-16th century Spanish pottery sherds.\n\nThe property owners granted a five-day window to excavate, and the UWF crew shared the lot with the construction company.\n\n\"We were out there literally sifting the back dirt of the trenches while workers were digging on the other end at the same time,\" Worth said. \"It really worked well, and the key is the project is still moving forward, and we have information we wouldn't have otherwise.\"\n\nGarner said a countless number of individuals probably walked that same site prior to him and tossed or kicked aside the sherds. Evidence of the first multi-year European settlement in United States history laid there waiting to be discovered, and fortunately for the UWF Archaeological Institute, Garner pulled over that afternoon to inspect the bulldozed lot.\n\n\"I know how important this is because all of these guys are smiling real big,\" Garner said of the UWF archaeologists. \"I haven't been patted on the back so much in my entire life, like I have by these guys.\"\n\nChapter 3: Neighbors excited to be part of Luna history\n\nA significant number of the neighbors already heard about the historic discovery of the Luna settlement through word of mouth and seeing archaeologists on site, but after University of West Florida President Judy Bense confirmed the rumor, the enthusiastic crowd cheered and clapped loud enough to be heard by anyone within a block radius.\n\nUWF officially announced discovery of the Luna colony Thursday morning in a press conference at T.T. Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum, but its president and those involved in the discovery decided to break the news to those who live on the site during a meeting the night before at Constant Coffee and Tea, 615 Scenic Highway. A crowd of about 100 filled the coffee shop to the brim.\n\n“All my life growing up I always said, Pensacola was the first settlement. I would never say St. Augustine was. I’d always say Pensacola was. And now guess what?” said 71-year-old Sherry Kennedy.\n\nPrincipal site investigator John Worth said St. Augustine still holds bragging rights as the oldest continuous settlement in the United States. Luna established the settlement in 1559 – six years before St. Augustine – but the colony lasted only into 1561.\n\nThe Luna colony is arguably the first European settlement and unquestionably the oldest multi-year European settlement.\n\nWorth said some historians will contend Juan Ponce de Leon, near Fort Myers in 1521, or Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon, near Brunswick, Ga., in 1526, established the first settlements in the United States. He said that is debatable, though. Those expeditions only lasted a few weeks at best and are yet to be discovered.\n\nWhen the crowd asked him Wednesday night if theirs is the oldest neighborhood in U.S. history, Worth said, “\n\nFuture excavations of the historic site by UWF archaeologists are dependent on the neighbors granting access to their private properties. The historical site is in an urban downtown neighborhood within view of the two uncovered shipwrecks linked to the Luna expedition in Pensacola Bay.\n\n“The property owners own the artifacts. They just do,” said Tom Garner, whose initial discovery of a mid-16th century olive jar rim Oct. 2 put this in motion. “It’ll be through their generosity, like the lot we just dug on. They generously said you can have these things, you can curate them.”\n\nThe News Journal spoke to six of the neighbors Wednesday night, and they each said they will allow UWF archaeologists to examine their property for artifacts.\n\nYvonne Bonifay Strouse already invited the UWF crew to her property. Her family first moved to Pensacola in the 1790s, and her house is nearly 100 years old. The 78-year-old Strouse said she heard about the Luna colony discovery when her first cousin, Harriett Allen, called and told her the news.\n\n“When I heard it, I was ecstatic. I got chill bumps,” Strouse said.\n\nWorth explained the history of the Luna settlement to the neighbors and then showed them pictures of a few of the artifacts discovered in the past two months at the site.\n\n“It’s absolutely fabulous,” said 76-year-old Shirley Gray, who moved into the neighborhood in 2003. “It’s very important. It’s about our history. It’s good for Pensacola. It’s good for the community. It’s great to know about. It’s great for West Florida. Just think of all the people. It’s wonderful.”\n\nWorth said the artifacts amount to mid-16th century Spanish garbage. He assured the neighbors there is no treasure to be found on their properties. The colonists nearly starved and traded any items of value to Native Americans for food.\n\nThat garbage will potentially unlock a treasure of information, though, and with that in mind, Worth asked the neighbors to call the UWF Archaeological Institute before digging in their yards.\n\n“I tell my students archaeology is less like Indiana Jones and more like Sherlock Holmes. We’re after clues,” said Worth, associate professor of historical archaeology in the UWF Department of Anthropology. “I want to know who they were, what they looked like, what their culture was like, what they came with, what they ate and all of that is based on post holes and pits and in context undisturbed. That’s where we get our best information.”\n\nWorth encouraged the neighbors to be active in the discovery and stay connected by asking questions at the site or following updates on his blog and the university website. He and the other UWF officials promised to be accommodating and not interfere in their daily lives.\n\n“I think everybody’s excited to allow them onto their property, and it sounds like they’re very respectful of it. That’s the most important thing,” said Bonnie Peters, who moved into the neighborhood in 1995 and owns two properties there.\n\nWhen asked if she is concerned about individuals possibly trespassing on her property in search of artifacts, Peters said, “I think it’ll die down. I just can’t really anticipate that. It’s going to be weird. Who lives this situation?”\n\nChapter 4: UWF Archaeology Program Profiles\n\nJOHN WORTH\n\nPrincipal investigator\n\nJohn E.

But in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBeneath the asphalt parking lot of America’s largest living history museum, gravesites linked to one of the nation’s oldest Black churches remained hidden for decades until last year.\n\nArchaeologists in Williamsburg, Virginia, are now excavating three burials at the original location of the historic 18th century First Baptist Church, launching a monthslong process to unearth information about who was buried there and what kind of lives they led.\n\nLast month, the archaeology team fully excavated the first burial of an individual in a wooden coffin and extracted bone for a DNA sample to be analyzed alongside analysis of the skeletal remains. The archaeology team is now working to prepare the second grave for excavation.\n\nFor the Black descendants of residents in Williamsburg, this effort is long overdue. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Black residents made up more than half the town’s population and members of the church included abolitionists, teachers and farmers.\n\nSince 1956, the church’s foundation has been covered by a parking lot owned by Colonial Williamsburg after the museum bought and demolished the structure.\n\nAnd it was largely forgotten. Throughout the years, visitors to Colonial Williamsburg parked their cars and walked over the foundation. Children would exit school buses on field trips to the 301 acre site dedicated to preserving the history of the Virginia town as it existed in the 18th century to “feed the human spirit by sharing America’s enduring story.”\n\nBut that history was not inclusive, historians and residents said.\n\nThe experiences of Black community members in the colonial era have often been left out, said Connie Harshaw, the president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, dedicated to preserving the church’s history. First Baptist Church being buried all these years is a testament to this erasure of history, she said.\n\n“It was an asphalt parking lot for more than 60 years with no regard to the people who lived there and who died and were buried there, whose names we don’t even know,” Harshaw said.\n\nThe journey to uncover First Baptist Church’s history began in 2020 with a partnership between Colonial Williamsburg and the non-profit foundation. Talks began in the spring of 2020, and digging began in the summer of 2020, Harshaw said.\n\n‘A lot of reckoning to do’\n\nThe 1856 First Baptist Church structure in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 20th century. courtesy Colonial Williamsburg\n\nAlvene Conyers remembers spending nearly every Sunday at First Baptist Church as a little girl.\n\nThe 75-year-old Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendant community said knowing the church’s foundation was covered by a parking lot was painful. Her mother, a seamstress, would knit her only the best attire to wear to First Baptist Church, with outfits including corduroy jumpers and ruffle-collared blouses to wear with patent leather shoes.\n\n“I felt devalued and dismissed and just unappreciated as a human being,” Conyers said. “Colonial Williamsburg has a lot of reckoning to do.”\n\nThe excavation project is the flagship initiative in Colonial Williamsburg’s efforts to better tell and represent the stories of Black Americans living in Williamsburg in the colonial era, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology. He said the fact that the church was covered by a parking lot is a tragic part of the project’s journey, but hopes the excavation begins to remedy some harm.\n\n“We’ve ripped up that parking lot and it will never go back,” Gary said.\n\nFirst Baptist Church was founded in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, Virginia’s colonial capital. Members secretly gathered under trees at a plantation to engage in song and prayer, defying state laws that prohibited Black people from congregating in large groups.\n\nBy 1818 there was a building on the lot, referred to on a tax document as the Baptist Meeting House.\n\nThe original structure of First Baptist Church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. Over two decades later, in 1856, a new brick church on the site of the first building was constructed and remained there until 1956, when Colonial Williamsburg bought and demolished the church as part of an expansion project, placing a parking lot over the historic location. Payment for the property was used to construct the congregation’s current church that sits about a mile away from the original site.\n\nToday, the church remains active and is on the US National Register of Historic Places. Harshaw said people travel from all over to visit the church, with visitors coming as far as Beirut and Kenya.\n\n“It’s no longer simply a community church. It’s a national treasure and everybody’s coming to see it,” Harshaw said.\n\nFrom demolition to dedication\n\nColonial Williamsburg archaeological field technician DéShondra Dandridge works at the excavation site of First Baptist Church's original permanent location in September 2020. courtesy Colonial Williamsburg\n\nFollowing a change in leadership, Harshaw said the current president of Colonial Williamsburg reached out to her in March 2020 after she previously met with former Colonial Williamsburg leadership and criticized the museum for failing to highlight the stories of the Black residents.\n\nAfter having conversations with the president about telling a more complete story about Williamsburg history that centered on the Black experience and the church’s cultural and historical significance, Harshaw said the excavation project commenced soon after when the parking lot was ripped up in August 2020.\n\nLast year, following about a year of excavating the site, archaeologists discovered the church’s original permanent structure, a 16- by 20-foot brick foundation atop a layer of soil that dates back to the early 1800s, according to the museum. Archaeologists also identified multiple gravesites.\n\nAlthough Harshaw said she had no idea there were intact burials on the site, she said some other members of the descendant community were ultimately not surprised when the plots were discovered last year. Older members of the church long spoke about their ancestors being buried at the church based on oral histories passed down generations.\n\nJohnette Weaver, a Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendent community, said she recalls hearing stories from a church elder about their great grandfather being buried at the original church site.\n\n“For Black people, a lot of our history is oral,” Weaver said. “It doesn’t mean that it’s untrue, it just means it wasn’t written anywhere or inscribed anywhere.”\n\nTo date, the Colonial Williamsburg archaeology team has identified a total of 41 burial shafts. Of these burials, only one is marked, by an upside down wine bottle at the foot of the grave. Gary speculates that this grave may have belonged to a church leader or someone of prominence in Williamsburg’s colonial community.\n\nThis marked grave will be the last of the three graves to be excavated and analyzed as part of the project.\n\nWilliamsburg's historic First Baptist Church, present day. courtesy First Baptist Church\n\nAnthony Pinn, a humanities professor at Rice University, said the discovery of the burials is significant given that under White supremacy in the Antebellum South, Black people were exploited and reduced to their physical bodies’ ability to provide labor. White supremacy also worked to deny Black people family connections and social ties under slavery, Pinn added.\n\n“Burial within the context of the Black church was not simply a recognition of death, but it was a recognition of life, that this person was substantive, had impact on the world, and that they had to be recognized and celebrated for who they were in a much fuller sense,” Pinn said.\n\nGary said accurately telling the story of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches is at the heart of the project. Following the excavation of each burial, he said the next step is to conduct both DNA and osteological analysis on the skeletal remains to gain more insight into who was buried at the church.\n\nThe DNA analysis, to be conducted by the University of Connecticut, is anticipated to uncover information about the three individuals’ skin tone, eye color and even their propensity for certain diseases. The analysis of the bones, to be performed at the College of William & Mary’s Institute for Historical Biology, is expected to show how old these individuals were when they died as well as their place of origin, sex, quality of life and more.\n\nMembers of the church’s descendant community eventually hope to submit their DNA to assess biological kinship to those buried at the church. At the conclusion of the project, the remains will be reinterred.\n\nGary said he expects this phase of the excavation project to take about a year, between the actual act of excavating the graves as well as analyzing and reinterring them. He said Colonial Williamsburg also hopes to reconstruct the church with historically accurate dimensions and furnishings to replicate how the church looked in the colonial era by 2026, the 250th anniversary of the church.\n\n“We’re going to put it back exactly where it was,” Gary said. “It’ll be sitting in its exact footprint, as it was the day the congregation built it in the early 1800s.”\n\nGary also said the input of the descendant community will be at the center of how Colonial Williamsburg proceeds with the project, including how to commemorate the site on a long-term basis and how they would like to see the remains reinterred.\n\nHarshaw said she hopes the project signals the importance of telling complete and accurate histories that reflect a diverse set of experiences.\n\n“We are really hoping that we will be an example for the nation,” Harshaw said. “If we can do it in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where you can drive up down I-95 on any given day and see Confederate flags, we are hoping that the rest of the nation will look to see what we’re doing and say ‘you know what, we probably need to do something about the fact that this place looked very different, or there’s a very different and more important and significant story,’ because the bottom line is this: We have a shared history.”", "authors": ["Jacquelyne Germain"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/world/sutton-hoo-ship-reconstruction-scn/index.html", "title": "Anglo-Saxon ship from 'The Dig' to sail after reconstruction | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen an Anglo-Saxon warrior king died 1,400 years ago in East Anglia in the United Kingdom, he was placed inside a ship and surrounded by treasures. The 90-foot-long (27.4-meter-long) wooden ship, dragged half a mile (0.8 kilometer) from the River Deben, was buried inside a mound.\n\nArchaeologists excavating the mound in 1939 recovered weapons, a warrior’s helmet and intricately designed treasures made from precious metals and jewels, along with rows of iron rivets.\n\nEdith Pretty, owner of the Suffolk property including the mounds, donated the treasure to The British Museum in London. The burial was likely that of Raedwald of East Anglia, who died in 624 AD.\n\nIf you’ve watched “The Dig” on Netflix, the story of the site at Sutton Hoo and its seventh century royal burial ground is a familiar one. It remains one of only three known Anglo-Saxon ship burials.\n\n“It kind of revolutionized our understanding of who the Anglo-Saxons were. This discovery illuminated the so-called Dark Ages and showed that these people were culturally sophisticated with amazing levels of craftsmanship and far-reaching trading connections,” said Laura Howarth, archaeology and engagement manager for the National Trust and Sutton Hoo site.\n\nThe ship itself, which has captivated so many, no longer exists. The wood rotted away in the acidic soil, but the precise positions of the planks left an impression in the sand, resembling the ghostly outline of the ship.\n\nThe River Deben is seen during low tide at Sutton Hoo. Justin Minns/National Trust Images\n\nTwo photographers, Mercie Lack and Barbara Wagstaff, captured images of the ship’s “fossil” imprint in 1939 before the mound was covered once more as World War II loomed.\n\nNow, Martin Carver, professor emeritus of archaeology at the University of York, and The Sutton Hoo Ship’s Company charity are undertaking the monumental task of bringing the ship back to life and enlisting a crew to row it across England’s rivers once again.\n\nRaising a ghost ship\n\nIn the town of Woodbridge, near Sutton Hoo, there has long been a dream to build a full-scale replica of the famed ship. Of the hundreds of finds from the burial, nearly all of which were originally found in pieces, the ship is the only item that hasn’t been reconstructed, Carver said.\n\nAfter the ship’s company charity was formed in 2016, the team began designing the plans.\n\nCarver, who directed excavations at Sutton Hoo between 1983 and 1992, is overseeing the construction, which is underway, and is raising funds for the project. The team hopes to raise 1.5 million pounds to build the ship, row it across rivers and estuaries, and give the ship a permanent home.\n\nThe reconstruction project has 70 volunteers, and the oldest volunteer just recently turned 90. Their task is to reconstruct the ship as accurately as possible with techniques from the Anglo-Saxons themselves, like using axes to shape the timbers. Oak trees from East Anglia are being used to construct the ship.\n\nVolunteers are using authentic Anglo-Saxon techniques to reconstruct the ship. The Sutton Hoo Ship's Company\n\nAnyone with an interest in supporting the reconstruction can sponsor handcrafted rivets and other parts of the ship on the Sutton Hoo charity website, Carver said.\n\nThe company plans to launch the ship on the water and begin rowing trials in the spring of 2024. A team of 40 rowers will train and learn how to handle the 16.4-foot-long (5-meter-long) wooden oars.\n\nThe original ship served a ceremonial purpose for the king’s burial, but there is evidence that the ship was mended and had a life on the water before the burial, Carver said.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2029, the ship will undertake three voyages that trace where the earliest English kingdoms were formed.\n\n“We want to put the rivers in the limelight, the motorways of the day,” Carver said. “The voyages will take us past many of the great early settlements discovered by archaeologists in the last few decades.”\n\nAnglo-Saxon ships were used to transport warriors, kings and cargo alike, and they were elegantly decorated and painted.\n\nThe keel of the ship has been laid and work has begun on the curved hull. The Sutton Hoo Ship's Company\n\n“I’m hoping that when the ship makes its trips, it will excite people in many different ways, but particularly in giving them a feeling of what a brilliant period this was in seventh century Britain,” Carver said.\n\nBy 2030, the ship will end its voyages and go on display – possibly across the river from Woodbridge at the Sutton Hoo visitor’s center.\n\nStepping back in time\n\nWorking on the ship is its own kind of experimental archaeology, Howarth said. She has worked at Sutton Hoo since 2014 and holds a master’s degree in medieval studies, specializing in seventh century Anglo-Saxons.\n\nWhen visitors arrive at Sutton Hoo, they are greeted by a sculpture that shows the scale of the ship. The intrigue of the ghost ship continues to draw people in, which is why Howarth believes that a tangible re-creation will allow them to connect with the adventurous spirit of their ancestors – as well as the ship’s symbolism.\n\n“It all kind of links back to journeys, both in life and in death and the ship being that kind of metaphor,” Howarth said.\n\nResearch continues at Sutton Hoo, and a number of tantalizing questions remain. No written records remain from the time period, but the artifacts and cemeteries the Anglo-Saxons left behind are beginning to fit together like a puzzle, revealing connections between communities.\n\nA new exhibit, “Swords of Kingdoms: The Staffordshire Hoard at Sutton Hoo,” has united items from the Staffordshire Hoard – the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver ever found, recovered in 2009 – with treasures from the Sutton Hoo site. The exhibition runs through October 30.\n\nSword pyramid fittings from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire Hoard are displayed together alongside a sword pommel from the Staffordshire Hoard and the Wilton Cross from Norfolk. Robin Pattinson/National Trust Images\n\nThe similarity in both design and craftsmanship of the objects from the two collections suggests they were made in the same seventh century East Anglia workshops, Howarth said.\n\nShe still marvels at the tiny gold and garnet cloisonné sword pyramids, decorative fittings associated with scabbards, discovered in the ship’s burial chamber by archaeologist Peggy Piggott in 1939.\n\n“How did they come up with such complex designs and concentrate them down to these tiny glittering treasures?” Howarth said. “That would probably be one thing that I’d like to go back and watch if I could jump in a time machine.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/world/stonehenge-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Unlock the secrets of Stonehenge through rare artifacts | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in Wonder Theory newsletter by CNN Space and Science writer Ashley Strickland, who finds wonder in planets beyond our solar system and discoveries from the ancient world.

Further into the distant past, there is evidence of wooden poles to mark the location that date back 10,000 years.\n\nAlthough a distinctly English site, Stonehenge bears the marks of long-distance links to other countries like Germany. But one enduring question remains: Why was it built?\n\nNo written records exist to shed light on the monument’s significance. However, the best way to understand something is to look at who created it.\n\nA long time ago\n\nStonehenge was built 4,500 years ago, but the true purpose of the monument remains elusive. Peter Richardson/English Heritage\n\nStonehenge was once at the center of a rapidly changing world, bearing witness to the shift from mobile hunter-gatherer societies to the founding of farms that sprawled across the United Kingdom.\n\nA new exhibition at The British Museum in London has collected 430 illuminating objects from an 8,000-year span across Europe, during which stone tools gave way to stunning metalwork. The rare artifacts shows what life was like when the megaliths were raised, offering an enticing glimpse into their secrets.\n\nSome objects could have cosmic significance, like the Nebra sky disc, which may have functioned as an astronomical calendar.\n\nOther fascinating items include an antler headdress, a jadeite axe-head and a carved stone drum, considered to be “the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years.”\n\nOther worlds\n\nIt has been a year since the Perseverance rover landed on Mars with its helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.\n\nSince then, the robotic duo have made history, simultaneously setting and breaking exploration records on the red planet.\n\nIngenuity has taken to the Martian skies 19 times, while Perseverance has collected six samples from rocks that will be returned to Earth in the 2030s.\n\nThis year, the intrepid adventurers are setting their sights on an intriguing new target: the remains of an ancient river delta. Exploring this destination is the prime reason scientists wanted to visit Mars’ Jezero Crater.\n\nSamples collected there could contain microfossils, which would be evidence of ancient life – if it ever existed on Mars.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nFlorida manatees are chowing down on 20,000 pounds of lettuce a week. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\n\nFlorida’s manatees are being treated to an aquatic salad bar, and it may save their lives.\n\nA new feeding program dumps roughly 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms) of romaine and butter lettuce into a popular manatee lagoon each week, serving about 350 manatees a day.\n\nThese marine mammals are dying at an alarming rate, largely due to starvation. There are only about 7,500 Florida manatees, and last year, more than 1,000 died.\n\nThe manatees are responding well to the program so far, showing up to chomp on leafy greens that give them the nutrients and digestible carbohydrates they need.\n\nDig this\n\nA fossil first discovered in 2010 is actually a previously unknown species of crocodile that lived in Australia 95 million years ago.\n\nBut even more rare was the surprise waiting inside of what was once the 8.2-foot-long (2.5-meter-long) reptile’s stomach: a young dinosaur.\n\nThe find is the first evidence of a crocodile preying on a dinosaur in Australia. The creature’s last meal suggests that it killed the dinosaur or foraged it soon after the dinosaur died.\n\nThe discovery is causing researchers to question the role dinosaurs played in the food chain, especially when they became the prey of other animals.\n\nClimate changed\n\nThis lichen species lives in the arid Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Matthew Nelsen/Field Museum\n\nRapid changes in our climate may outpace the evolution of some of Earth’s most wide-ranging organisms, like lichen.\n\nThose funky-looking patches you see on trees and rocks cover 7% of the planet’s surface. Algae live inside of greenhouse-like structures provided by fungus, and together they form lichen, anywhere from the Arctic tundra to the most arid desert.\n\nLichens create oxygen, retain moisture and contribute to water cycling in ecosystems. They also serve as a food source for many species, including some mammals, like reindeer.\n\nAnd scientists were shocked to discover that the tiny algae within lichen may take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years to adapt as Earth’s climate changes more quickly than ever.\n\nCuriosities\n\nLinger a little longer:\n\n– Scientists are trying to determine what sent hundreds of birds crashing to the ground in Mexico last week. The startling incident was captured on video.\n\n– A new NASA mission has shared its first stunning image, revealing glowing purple clouds around the remains of an exploded star.\n\n– This “very rare” baby ghost shark, discovered off the coast of New Zealand, could help researchers understand more about these mysterious creatures of the deep.\n\nLike what you’ve read?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe surprising discovery of mammoth fossils in a paleontologist’s backyard have led to an even more unexpected finding.\n\nThe roughly 37,000-year-old remains of a female mammoth and her calf show distinct signs of butchering, providing new evidence that humans may have arrived in North America much earlier than believed.\n\nPaleontologist Timothy Rowe first learned of the fossils in 2013 when a neighbor noticed something sticking out of a hillside on some New Mexico property belonging to Rowe.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Rowe found a tusk, a bashed-in mammoth skull and other bones that looked deliberately broken. He believed it was the site where two mammoths had been butchered.\n\n“What we’ve got is amazing,” Rowe said in a statement. “It’s not a charismatic site with a beautiful skeleton laid out on its side. It’s all busted up. But that’s what the story is.”\n\nRowe, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences, is an expert in vertebrate paleontology and doesn’t typically study mammoths or early humans. But he couldn’t help but work on the research due to the discovery’s location.\n\nThe excavation site contained fractured bones from a mammoth skull, spine and ribs. Timothy Rowe/The University of Texas at Austin\n\nTwo six-week excavations took place at the site in 2015 and 2016, but analysis in the lab has taken much longer and remains ongoing, Rowe said. He is the lead author of a new study providing an analysis of the site and its implications, which published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution in July.\n\n“I have yet to fully process the cosmic coincidence of this site appearing in my back yard,” Rowe wrote in an email.\n\nAnalyzing the site\n\nMultiple finds at the site paint a portrait of what took place there thousands of years ago, including bone tools, evidence of a fire, bones bearing fractures and other signs of animal butchering by humans.\n\nLong mammoth bones shaped into disposable blades were used to break down the animal carcasses before a fire helped melt down their fat.\n\nFractures created by blunt force can be seen in the bones, according to the study. No stone tools were at the site, but researchers found flake knives made from bones with worn edges.\n\nA chemical analysis of the sediment around the mammoth bones showed that the fire was sustained and controlled rather than caused by a wildfire or lightning strike. There was also evidence of bone that had been pulverized as well as burned small animal remains, including birds, fish, rodents and lizards.\n\nThe research team used CT scans to analyze the bones from the site, finding puncture wounds that would have been used to drain fat from ribs and vertebrae. The humans who butchered the mammoths were thorough, Rowe said.\n\nButchering marks can be seen on the mammoth ribs. The top rib shows a fracture from blunt force impact, the middle rib shows a puncture wound and the bottom rib shows chopping marks. Timothy Rowe et al./The University of Texas at Austin\n\n“I have excavated dinosaurs that were scavenged, but the pattern of bone disarticulation and breakage from human butchering was unlike anything I had seen,” Rowe said.\n\nThe most surprising detail about the site is that it’s in New Mexico – and previous evidence has suggested that humans weren’t there until tens of thousands of years later.\n\nRetracing early human steps\n\nCollagen taken from the mammoth bones helped the researchers determine that the animals were butchered at the site between 36,250 and 38,900 years ago. This age range makes the New Mexico site one of the oldest that ancient humans created in North America, researchers said.\n\nScientists have debated for years when early humans first arrived in North America.\n\nThis illustration depicts what mammoths looked like thousands of years ago. National Park Service\n\nThe 16,000-year-old Clovis culture is known because of the stone tools it left behind. But an increasing amount of evidence suggests that older North American sites were home to a pre-Clovis population that had a different genetic lineage. The older sites have a different kind of evidence, such as preserved footprints, bone tools or animal bones bearing cut marks older than 16,000 years ago.\n\n“Humans have been in the Americas for more than twice as long as archaeologists have maintained for many years,” Rowe said. “This site indicates that humans attained a global distribution far earlier than previously understood.”\n\nThe position of the site, which is well within North America’s western interior, suggests that the first humans arrived well before 37,000 years ago, according to the study. These early humans likely traveled over land or along coastal routes.\n\nRowe said he wants to sample the site to look for signs of ancient DNA next.\n\n“Tim has done excellent and thorough work that represents frontier research,” retired Texas State University professor Mike Collins said in a release. “It’s forging a path that others can learn from and follow.”\n\nCollins was not involved with the study. He led research at the Gault archaeological site, which contains both Clovis and pre-Clovis artifacts, near Austin, Texas.\n\n“I think the deeper meaning of early human attainment of a global distribution is an important new question to explore,” Rowe said. “Our new techniques provided nuanced evidence of a human presence in the archaeological record, and I suspect that there are other sites of comparable age or even older that have gone unrecognized.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2012/12/29/hopi-artifacts-stirs-questions/1798087/", "title": "Effort to return Hopi artifacts stirs questions", "text": "Dennis Wagner, The Arizona Republic\n\nRepatriation act has sparked controversy between tribes, archaeologists\n\nRecords indicate Hopi remains were those of sacred ancestor known as the Magician\n\nNationwide, nearly 13,000 corpses have been returned to tribes under repatriation act\n\nPHOENIX -- On an unknown date at an unidentified location, the U.S. government turned over a collection of undisclosed Sinagua artifacts to anonymous members of the Hopi Tribe for unspecified disposition.\n\nThe mysterious proceedings this fall involved an archaeological treasure trove and a substantial expenditure of tax dollars. Yet virtually everything about it remains secret under a federal law known as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA.\n\nThe 1990 law enables Indian tribes to reclaim ancestral remains and sacred objects that were unearthed from native burial sites by scientists or looters. Along with supplemental statutes, it also authorizes U.S. agencies to conceal virtually all details of those transactions.\n\nThe recent Hopi event involved archaeological digs from Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff. When The Arizona Republic sought a description of the repatriated items and an accounting of federal money spent, the government repeatedly answered, \"Our intent is to honor the tribe's request, made in consultation, not to disclose information.\"\n\nThe secrecy and phrasing hint at an underlying controversy that has festered since the repatriation act was adopted.\n\nFor Native Americans, the repatriation of remains and funerary objects is a matter of justice — the return of sacred possessions that were dug up, defiled and displayed for decades in violation of tribal beliefs and human rights. To this day, activists are pushing to expand the law in the name of privacy, religious freedom and tribal sovereignty.\n\nConversely, for some archaeologists and anthropologists, the loss of ancient artifacts represents a scientific sacrilege — disposal of objects that may be irreplaceable in understanding human history and cultures.\n\nMost researchers no longer defend the excavation of Indian burial sites, and few will publicly criticize the repatriation act because to do so would jeopardize their professional careers. But, privately, the repatriation of relics that were unearthed decades ago continues to raise questions of academic freedom, political correctness and the public's right to know.\n\nOfficials at the Museum of Northern Arizona, which housed at least some of the bones and artifacts returned to the Hopis this year, cooperated with the repatriation and declined to discuss the Sinagua collection. The non-profit museum sponsored many of the area archaeological digs years ago and remains a repository for artifacts.\n\nKelley Hays-Gilpin, anthropology curator, said that those items were the property of the federal government and that only a fraction of the museum's collection was lost. \"It's not like we're getting emptied out,\" she said.\n\nStill, records and sources indicate that items claimed by the Hopis included one of the most scientifically important burial subjects ever found in the Southwest — and perhaps one of the most sacred of Hopi ancestors.\n\nHe is known as the Magician, and his remains were accompanied by a unique archaeological bounty.\n\nSwallower of Sticks\n\nThe man was buried at a place known as the Ridge Ruin, about 20 miles outside Flagstaff, in an unremarkable house of stone and clay. He remained there, undisturbed, for 800 years.\n\nThen, in the late 1930s, John C. McGregor, an archaeologist at the Museum of Northern Arizona, uncovered the skeleton, along with more than 600 carefully placed funerary objects: ornate jewelry, baskets, cutting blades, mountain-lion teeth, shells, a pointy cap made of beads and, as a final offering, 420 arrows.\n\nMcGregor found what he called \"the most outstanding decorative basket that has ever been found in the Southwest,\" featuring 1,500 carefully cut pieces of turquoise as well as rows of other stones and rodent teeth.\n\nMany items, such as an exotic macaw corpse, were from distant lands. Some researchers suggested that the man of about 40 was a traveling Aztec merchant, or pochteca.\n\nBut Hopis who assisted and consulted McGregor said many of the objects were associated with ancient tribal skills such as shape-shifting, combating witchcraft and controlling weather or warfare. For example, they said 13 wooden pointers, laid over the remains, were used in a sort of sword-swallowing feat of magic by members of a warrior society. They called the man Moochiwimi, or Swallower of Sticks.\n\nIn a 1943 article for the American Philosophical Society, McGregor wrote that the Magician comprised \"the richest burial ever reported in the Southwest.\" Others described it as \"The King Tut of Northern Arizona.\"\n\nTo this day, the Magician remains a subject of research and conjecture.\n\nMichael O'Hara, a professor at Arizona State University's School of Human Evolution and Social Change, wrote about him last year in a paper for the Society for American Archaeology.\n\nO'Hara disputed the theory that ceremonial items reflected wealth, suggesting instead that the interment of ritual objects helped mourners reorder their social unit after the loss of a key figure.\n\nO'Hara, who did not respond to interview requests, wrote that the Magician represents a \"spectacular and wholly unique\" archaeological find that provides \"unparalleled insights into the social roles present in Sinagua society.\"\n\nThe Hopi way\n\nEven today, Hopi tribal structure is based on a network of social groups, each with specialized responsibilities, skills and secret rituals stemming from spiritual beliefs.\n\nReligious practices are considered so sacred that the secrets are not even shared among various societies. No Hopi who was contacted for this story would comment.\n\nThat deep sense of privacy is exemplified in a \"Protocol for Research and Publication\" posted on the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office website.\n\nThe protocol prohibits archaeological, anthropological or historical work — even news stories — without permission, and authorizes censorship of information deemed sensitive or thought to misrepresent the Hopi way.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, Congress adopted the repatriation act with support from most major archaeology and anthropology associations. The Heard Museum in Phoenix spearheaded recommendations.\n\nThe law established a process for Native Americans to reclaim bones, burial relics and other items of \"cultural patrimony\" that were collected by scientists or stolen by looters. Scores of museums and federal agencies are required to create lists of remains or sacred objects and determine whether those items are affiliated with modern indigenous groups. Inventories are supposed to be published in the Federal Register.\n\nNationwide, nearly 179,000 whole or partial corpses have been identified, with nearly 13,000 of those returned to tribes. More than two-thirds of the remains have not been linked to modern tribes.\n\nIn addition, museums and federal agencies have listed about 2 million funerary or sacred objects. Roughly 176,000 of those have been turned over to tribes.\n\nSince 1996, the National NAGPRA Program has issued more than $500,000 in grants to the Hopi Tribe for repatriation.\n\nThe federal program is managed by Sherry Hutt, who served for years as a Maricopa County Superior Court judge. Hutt, who also prosecuted artifact looters as an assistant U.S. attorney in Phoenix, said the law gives indigenous people a tool to regain items that were rightfully theirs. To put it in context, she said, imagine if someone wanted to dig up your parents for a new roadway: Who should decide what is done with the remains?\n\n\"Really, what NAGPRA says is Native Americans are just like everybody else — no more, no less,\" Hutt said. \"It does not say you can't do science. What it says is: 'These are not your personal property.'\"\n\nDestroying history?\n\nResistance from some scientists is hardly new. In an essay published 15 years ago, Grinnell College (Iowa) anthropologist John Whittaker discussed a great divide between researchers and Native Americans.\n\nWhittaker opened with a stanza from the Indian protest song, \"Here Come the Anthros,\" by the late Sioux musician Floyd Red Crow Westerman:\n\nThe Anthros keep on digging our sacred ceremonial sites\n\nAs if there's nothing wrong and education gives them the right.\n\nBut the more they keep on digging, the less they really see,\n\n'Cause they got no respect, for you or for me.\n\nWhittaker offered a response, without rhymes:\n\n\"He wants me to leave it alone; I want to excavate it and learn from it. He wants control to be in Indian hands; I regard it as a human heritage that belongs to all. … I am interested in his opinions about the past; he doesn't think I have anything to say to him.\"\n\nWhittaker, who declined to comment for this story, argued in his essay that science honors the dead by studying their lives and adding historical understanding to present-day cultures. He wrote that NAGPRA is \"subtly racist\" and \"disastrous for archaeology\" because it makes research politically incorrect while wiping out the chance to learn from previous finds.\n\n\"The laws have resulted in the destruction by reburial of vast amounts of archaeological evidence,\" he said.\n\nOther prominent researchers have made similar points in litigation against NAGPRA, arguing that ancient remains in North America go back 11,000 years or more and, in some cases, have no cultural or genetic ties with modern Indians.\n\nIn a famous suit known as the Kennewick Man case, two archaeologists at the Smithsonian Institution and a University of Arizona professor were among eight plaintiffs who blocked the transfer of a 9,000-year-old skeleton to tribes in Washington state. A federal judge ruled there was no evidence tying the remains to contemporary cultures or people, so scientists were entitled to conduct research under another law, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act.\n\nC. Vance Haynes Jr., a professor emeritus of anthropology and geology at the University of Arizona, said he consulted with a Hopi colleague before signing on as plaintiff in the Kennewick case. \"He told me, 'You know, Vance, we're not all one Indian. There are a lot of us who want to know where we came from, and about our past.'\"\n\nHaynes specializes in the roughly 13,000-year-old Clovis culture, among the earliest humans in North America. \"NAGPRA is a very important law,\" he said. \"But, when it comes to sites more than 4,000 years old, we need to be able to study. ... Our whole mission is to increase knowledge.\"\n\nCleone Hawkinson, an anthropologist and president of a group known as Friends of America's Past, said federal policy discriminates in favor of Native Americans and thwarts the quest to fathom human development.\n\n\"NAGPRA is a narrow law, unfairly administered,\" said Hawkinson, who assisted plaintiffs in the Kennewick case. \"Factual understanding of the past is distorted when a limited group is singled out as rightful 'owners' of all of prehistory and scientific inquiry is prohibited to evaluate their claims.\"\n\nStolen remains\n\nJames Riding In, an American Indian studies scholar at Arizona State University, said indigenous people of the Western Hemisphere were victimized by grave-digging in the name of science and are only now able to let forebears rest in peace.\n\n\"The dead are not resources belonging to an invading culture,\" he said. \"The problem is that archaeologists and anthropologists stole those remains and created those issues.\"\n\nThere is not a homogeneous Indian perspective on death or afterlife but scores of different beliefs, Riding In said. Some may welcome archaeological inquiry, he said, but many view the excavation and removal of corpses as taboo.\n\nRiding In said his people, the Pawnees, are among the latter: \"There's still a spirit associated with those remains. The only purpose for disturbing the dead (in Pawnee culture) is to do harm to the living through witchcraft.\"\n\nRiding In, who has participated in a number of repatriation events, said bones and artifacts are usually reburied either where they were unearthed or in an ancestral homeland. He said that archaeology and anthropology sometimes help Native people learn about the past or verify sacred sites or objects but that modern science also denigrates their beliefs as fairy tales.\n\nTribes have a right to privacy in reclaiming the ancients, regardless of tax dollars expended, Riding In and others said. \"It is a sovereignty issue that allows Indians to determine what happens to their deceased. … It should be respected,\" he said.\n\nSince NAGPRA was adopted, remains from more than 1,200 humans have been claimed by Arizona tribes in about 40 repatriation events.\n\nJohn McClelland, NAGPRA coordinator at the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, said he got no official word that Hopis took possession of the Magician, but there were rumors. He added that the event apparently included additional Sinagua items that had been housed at the museum in Tucson.\n\nMcClelland said that NAGPRA is a fact of life and that most contemporary archaeologists respect the sensitivity of living people even if they regret the vanishing of scientific materials that might yield new information about their forebears. \"It's true, there is a loss,\" he said. \"Basically, that's the reality these days. ... The bottom line is it's a matter of human rights and Native American rights.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/29"}]}

After a volunteer filed a personal injury lawsuit in 2013 over an ATV accident at the 2011 Chunk, the farmer hosting it in Sussex County said he wouldn't let it return to his property.\n\nOrganizers had settled on the late-October date for this year's Chunk before they were certain where it would take place.

Customers who had already bought tickets and camping passes this year will see refunds on their credit cards within two weeks, he said.\n\nPoll: Will you miss the annual Punkin Chunkin competition this year?\n\nGary Camp, a spokesman for Dover International Speedway, said the postponement was due to several things, including permits, site layout, public safety aand emergency service planning.\n\n\"All along we were cautiously optimistic that the event would go on as scheduled,\" Camp said. \"Ultimately, the logistics of trying to coordinate such a large established event in such a short time frame at a new venue became too difficult to overcome.\"\n\nBoth parties are committed to hosting the event in Dover, Camp added.\n\nThe very first Punkin Chunkin competition was a small event held near Lewes in 1986. Over the years, it grew much more popular, moving to ever-bigger fields and routinely featured in a show on the Discovery Channel.\n\nContestants in the most powerful air cannon division have inched ever closer to propelling a pumpkin for a mile.

This year's competition will mark the 30th ever Punkin Chunkin.\n\nHere is a deeper look back at the turbulent history of the former Delaware tradition.\n\n1986: The first Punkin Chunkin competition is held near Milton with a handful of spectators and three contestants, according to News Journal archives. It was the brainchild of Trey Melson and Bill Thompson after an argument about who could find a way to throw a pumpkin farther.\n\n1989: Organizers expected a half-dozen machines, and no registration was required. Then-spokesman Harry Lackhove predicted a throw of 1,000 feet could take top prize and earn the winner \"a cap or T-shirt and the right to crow for a year,\" he told The News Journal.\n\n1991: About 5,000 turned out to see about 12 entrants with wooden catapults and motorized machines, The News Journal reported at the time.\n\n1992: The event drew an estimated 7,500 to 10,000 people from as far away as Canada and Alaska to watch nine contestants, according to News Journal archives.\n\n1993: Punkin Chunkin wins the Governor's Tourism Award as Delaware's outstanding special event. It expanded in 1993, adding human-powered and youth divisions plus a pumpkin recipe contest.\n\n2002: Punkin Chunkin is televised for the first time by the Discovery Channel.\n\n2007: The event moves to Bridgeville due to increasing space needs. The new location was at the intersection of Seashore Highway and Chaplains Chapel Road.\n\n2009: The Science Channel begins its annual coverage of Punkin Chunkin. It quickly becomes a staple of their Thanksgiving programming.\n\n2011: A volunteer is injured in an ATV accident at the 2011 edition of Punkin Chunkin.\n\n2013: A volunteer files a personal injury lawsuit regarding an ATV accident in 2011. After the lawsuit is filed, the farmer who hosted the event says he won't let it return to his property. The lawsuit is eventually settled out of court.\n\nOct. 3, 2014: Punkin Chunkin is canceled a little less than a month before it was scheduled to take place at its new location, the Dover International Speedway. Event organizers say the event will start in its new Dover location in 2015.\n\nOct. 8, 2015: For the second straight year Punkin Chunkin is canceled. The event is shuttered in part due to difficulty finding an insurer. It's in this time that event organizers begin considering Maryland locations.\n\nNov. 3-5, 2016: Punkin Chunkin returns after a two-year hiatus. The three-day event is held at Wheatley Farms in Bridgeville. Event organizers struggled to find a location willing to host the event and an insurer.\n\nNov. 5, 2016: Suzanne Dakessian is critically injured when an air cannon blows apart while firing a pumpkin and a piece of it strikes her in the head.

The preliminary proposal calls for the event to take place at the Inlet parking lot where pumpkins would be launched into the ocean instead of farm fields. Punkin Chunkin officials indicate that there has been interest in areas outside of Delmarva, including Illinois and Colorado.\n\n\"We are still here.

The 2015 World Championship Punkin Chunkin event set for Nov. 7-8 has been canceled.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we announce the cancellation of the 2015 World Championship Punkin Chunkin event,\" a post read Thursday morning on the Punkin Chunkin Facebook page. \"Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of our board throughout an exhaustive nationwide search, we have been unable to locate a willing insurer to adequately protect our host venue, our organization, our fans and our spectators.\"\n\nRicky Nietubicz, World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association president, confirmed the cancellation.\n\nThe event drew thousands to watch homemade contraptions of every type sling pumpkins across great distances, some as far as a mile. The event started in 1986 in a Lewes farm field and grew in popularity. The Discovery Channel in recent years sent crews to document the event for an hour-long television special.\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" he said. \"Fortunately there are a lot of other events that we've been able to grow nationwide at this point.\"\n\nPunkin Chunkin lawsuit dismissed after agreement\n\nHe added that the group was given \"all of the leeway in the world from Dover International Speedway.\"\n\nDover International Speedway spokesman Gary Camp also confirmed the news, saying that “with about a month to go, I think they ultimately realized they weren’t going to have any luck.”\n\n\"There’s been a good amount of work done behind the scenes to prepare for the event,\" Camp said. But the speedway didn’t want to do much more without proof of insurance coverage, he said.\n\n\"The collective decision was made to halt planning for the event,\" Camp said.\n\nThis is the second time the event has had to be canceled since moving from Sussex County, It has drawn thousands of people to watch the massive air cannons and catapults shoot pumpkins over large distances.\n\nPunkin Chunkin has been seeking a permanent home since 2013 after the farmer hosting the longstanding event in Sussex County said he wouldn’t let it return to his property. He and the event’s organizers faced a personal injury lawsuit filed by a volunteer after an ATV accident at the 2011 Chunk. The lawsuit has since been settled out of court.\n\nCommittee targeting racial disparities to hold hearings\n\nDelaware stormwater rules tossed by court\n\nBefore the event was canceled this year, there were concerns about how the grounds at the speedway could accommodate some aspects of the event. Chunkers removed the distance competition from the weekend's activities, acknowledging there wasn't room for the air cannons to propel pumpkins nearly a mile downrange, as there had been in Sussex.\n\nCindy Small, executive director of Kent County Tourism, said she’s disappointed for the area.\n\n“We’re sad that our businesses are going to miss out,” Small said. “It would have been new business for everyone and would have probably brought a new customer to our area.”\n\n“Like any large event, our hoteliers and restaurateurs were excited about it,” she added. The event would have brought new revenue for all of the businesses.\n\nMoving the event out of Delaware has \"always been a serious consideration\" and Nietubicz said the group is 100 percent committed to ensuring the event moves forward.\n\n\"That's why this is most disappointing. We're going to explore all of our options,\" he said. \"There are more favorable regulatory environments elsewhere... At this point, we're really exploring all options.\"\n\nRep. Valerie Longhurst criticized over 'scathing' email\n\nScientists discover why elephants rarely get cancer\n\nSen. Brian Pettyjohn, R-Georgetown, said Thursday he doubted Punkin Chunkin would ever take root again in Delaware. Pettyjohn sponsored a bill this year to cap pain-and-suffering damages at $1 million for personal injury lawsuits filed against nonprofit companies sponsoring annual special events. The bill has not been discharged from the Senate Executive Committee, and a member of the Delaware Trial Lawyers Association testified against it in a hearing.\n\n\"It looks like we're going to lose the event here in Delaware, and we're never going to get it back,\" Pettyjohn said. \"Maybe if this was a New Castle County event, we'd get some motion out of it. But it's been a Sussex County event, and it seems the magnitude of the event is lost on the other legislators.\"\n\nNietubicz said the legislation going through \"wouldn't have hurt.\"\n\n\"That being said, you know, it's impossible to say what could have, or would have, or may have been the case.\"\n\nStill, Pettyjohn said, he will renew his push to get his legislation to the Senate floor when the legislature reconvenes in a few months.\n\n\"The other side said it's not going to be a problem, and here we are,\" Pettyjohn said. \"I hate to say I told you so. But I told you so.\"\n\nBy late August, when it started selling admission tickets, Punkin Chunkin had dozens of competitor teams registered for the early-November event. But since teams knew the Chunk would not have the distance competition that defines many pumpkin-tossing events around the country, some of them had already made other arrangements to keep the spirit of competition alive.\n\nRalph Eschborn, captain of the Big 10 Inch air cannon team that's competed at the Chunk since 1998, this week is in Aurora, Colorado, a Denver suburb that for years has put on its own Punkin Chunkin event. Big 10 Inch is practically a Delaware native; the Eschborns live in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania., and the cannon is stored in Delaware City.\n\nEschborn said the Delaware Chunk's announced format change, from competition to events like blasting old cars apart with pumpkin barrages, opened the door to new chunk events and gave other established events like Aurora's more support.\n\nHis team had planned to come to Dover next month — for the fun of it, and to remain eligible for regional competition. \"We were going to do target practice, which is a crowd-pleaser, frankly,\" Eschborn said in an interview. \"You blow the doors off a car and the crowd goes wild.\"\n\nBut he said he is skeptical Punkin Chunkin can pull off a comeback in Delaware; more likely, he said, is that the event will move to Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\n\"I always thought this was a Delmarva thing. The culture’s the same. Why not move it over the border 10 miles?\" Eschborn said. \"They need to redouble their efforts on that.\"\n\nReach Jon Offredo at (302) 678-4271 or joffredo@delawareonline.com.

Team captains had voted on the location change, with 70 percent saying \"yes\" to the move.\n\nThe small town Delaware event gained nationwide coverage over the years. Discovery Channel aired its first Punkin Chunkin documentary in 2002, and it had been broadcast for several years, often on Thanksgiving night, on Discovery's Science Channel.\n\nAs it gained popularity, the chunk also grew in competition, with teams building bigger and more sophisticated pumpkin-throwing machinery for the three-day event.\n\nThe nationally televised event would attract upwards of 20,000 people annually.\n\nPunkin Chunkin tried to gain traction on grounds in either Maryland or Delaware this year, but the event requires a good amount of land, which couldn't be found in time on Delmarva.\n\nBriefly, Punkin Chunkin officials debated hosting the championship in Ocean City, where the gourds would be catapulted into the ocean instead of fields, as they had for decades.\n\nThe owners of its longtime venue, a 600-acre property in Bridgeville, decided not to continue to host the event.

Instead, a somewhat sparse barroom crowd will gather this weekend at a small Rehoboth Beach-area surf bar for what they call Pumpkin' Chuckin'.\n\nThe only guns that'll be featured at Big Chill Surf Cantina Saturday will be the biceps of men and women who will have two throws each to see how far they can toss a pumpkin across a parking lot using only brute strength.\n\nIt's the bar's second annual Pumpkin' Chuckin.' The idea was hatched last year when it was announced that the iconic World Championship Punkin Chunkin would be canceled due to a lawsuit brought by a woman critically injured by an exploding air cannon in 2016.\n\n\"We wanted to pay homage,\" says Matt Garbutt, brand manager for both Big Chill Surf Cantina and its sister bar at the Indian River Inlet, Big Chill Beach Club. \"Whatever is stupid and fun — that's what we're all about.\"\n\nHow the new Pumpkin' Chuckin' was born\n\nWhen Punkin Chunkin was canceled in late summer 2017, Garbutt and Lincoln \"Linc\" Rogerson, Big Chill Surf Cantina co-owner and general manager, lamented its loss in a brainstorming meeting.\n\nIt didn't take long before the fun-loving bar, which hosts events like the Mad Hatter New Year's Eve Blacklight Party each year, figured out a way to keep pumpkins flying in Sussex County.\n\n\"We just decided to see how far people could throw a pumpkin because obviously we couldn't have catapults and all that,\" says Garbutt, who hosts the competition in the rear parking lot of the bar. \"So we figured, 'Hey, what better fall event than giving people some beer and seeing how far they can throw these pumpkins.'\"\n\nIt will be held Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. at the bar, located at 19406 Del. 1 next to the now-former home of Liquid Board Shop, which closed Oct. 1 after an 11-year run.\n\nHow to compete\n\nIf you want to toss a pumpkin Saturday, go to the event's online registration page at eventbrite.com. Just type Pumpkin' Chuckin' and Rehoboth Beach to find it.\n\nIt costs $10 to enter, with all the proceeds benefiting the Rehoboth Beach Volunteer Fire Company.\n\nEach contestant will have two tosses and the person with the highest combined distance will be crowned the champion.\n\nWhat do they win other than perhaps a trip to Walgreen's for some extra strength Doan's?\n\nThe winner gets a $200 La Vida Hospitality Group gift certificate. La Vida locations at Delaware's beaches include Big Chill Surf Cantina, Big Chill Beach Club, Crooked Hammock Brewery, Fork+Flask at Nage and the Taco Reho food truck.\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhile it costs a Hamilton to enter the contest, it's free to spectate.\n\nJust show up, grab a beer and prepare to point and giggle.\n\nCrooked Hammock will be on site with a beer tent, pouring its craft brews on what is going to be a breezy, chilly day with the temperature hovering around 45.\n\nAnd don't worry, you won't have to look your best if you are concerned the Science Channel will be the filming the ridiculousness, just like it used to at Punkin Chunkin.\n\n\"I don't think we're on their radar yet,\" jokes Garbutt, whose bar opened in 2011.\n\nLast year's inaugural event\n\nSince they only came up with the idea a few weeks before the inaugural Pumpkin' Chuckin' last fall, organizers scrambled to put it together.\n\nOnly 20 people — all men because no females entered — competed with maybe 40 people at most spectating.\n\nWith a pile of 18- to 20-pound pumpkins to choose from, Garbutt estimates the longest throw was maybe 40 feet.\n\nBut seeing how far the pumpkins would go was not the real draw in the end. It was the hilarious spectacle of people figuring out the best way to chuck a pumpkin, and usually failing miserably.\n\n\"Everyone thinks they know how to throw a pumpkin, but they don't,\" Garbutt says. \"The funniest part wasn't the successes, but the fails.\"\n\nLa Vida Hospitality digital marketing manager Tom Little may have drawn the biggest laughs when he tried a new approach.\n\nSince contestants have to throw the pumpkin from inside an area made of bales of hay, there is no running and throwing.\n\nLittle decided to turn his back to the parking lot and give the pumpkin a heave-ho over his shoulders while a friend of his shot video on his phone.\n\nIt didn't go as planned.\n\nThe pumpkin flew out of his hands and he toppled over the hay bale, landing on his back. Within seconds, he was grabbing his belly while laughing uncontrollably while the crowd did the same.\n\n\"After seeing other people try it with little success, I thought that if I acted like a human catapult, I might be able to really use my legs and get behind it,\" Little says. \"Instead, I lost my footing and it didn't go too far.\n\n\"If someone asked me right now what the best way was to throw a pumpkin, I still wouldn't know what to tell them.\"\n\nThe old Punkin Chunkin's history\n\nPumpkins flying through the air in Delaware dates back to 1986.\n\nHeld each weekend after Halloween, World Championship Punkin Chunkin had such a strong three-decade run that both Discovery Channel and Science Channel aired multiple specials over the years, even attracting the hosts of \"Mythbusters\" to anchor the broadcast.\n\nAfter starting in Lewes, the event outgrew the location and eventually settled in Bridgeville.\n\nEven before cable television specials began airing from the tiny, 2,000-person scrapple-making town of Bridgeville, national media had already come to The First State to document the downright zany event.\n\nAs The Washington Post wrote in 1998, \"The Punkin Chunk is an utterly impractical event that is, paradoxically, a tribute to practical people — to the tinkerers, the backyard fixer-uppers, the can-do guys who look at a massive screw-up, rub their chins and say, 'Hey, I think we can fix this sucker if we just get some PVC pipe, an air compressor and some duct tape.'\"\n\nIn its earliest years, a winning distance was less than 200 feet using catapults and other homemade contraptions. By 2013, the winning team, American Chunker Inc., shot a pumpkin nearly 4,700 feet using a high-powered air cannon.\n\nTeams used everything over the years from homemade slings, catapults and centrifugal force launchers to trebuchets and pneumatic cannons.\n\nCrowds as big as 100,000 would watch in the cold, plenty of whom would chug beers while watching pumpkins hurtle through the air. It was kind of like a gourd-themed tailgate.\n\nThe death of Punkin Chunkin\n\nBut the final years of Punkin Chunkin were a sad coda to its previous success.\n\nThe pumpkins were grounded in 2014 and 2015 after a former volunteer sued the organization, and the Bridgeville farm where it took place, over an ATV accident that injured the volunteer's spine. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed before going to trial.\n\nThe Bridgeville landowner then had second thoughts about hosting another Punkin Chunkin after all the legal wrangling.\n\nAfter organizers considered a move to Dover Downs International Speedway in Dover and Maryland's Eastern Shore, the event returned to the same Bridgeville field in 2016 with new rules.\n\nIt was no longer an unregulated BYOB free-for-all due to both new insurance rules and a desire to clean up the sometimes-rowdy three-day event.\n\nFrank Payton, then-president of World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association, told The News Journal at the time, \"This is a family fun event, but we still wanted to let the partiers party.

News Journal\n\nAmerican Chunker claimed prize in Adult Air Cannon category\n\nDistances were held down by winds with gusts near 20 mph\n\nSome competitors said more pumpkin launches than usual disintegrated after going airborne\n\nBRIDGEVILLE, Del. -- Nature helped to squash some hopes and steered others to pumpkin glory Sunday as thousands crowded a windblown firing line for the final day of the 28th annual World Championship Punkin Chunkin in a stubbly cornfield east of Bridgeville, Del.\n\nNew Hampshire-based American Chunker Inc.'s 4,694.68-foot shot in perfect weather Friday was never threatened during the rest of the weekend-long competition, giving the 4-year-old team this year's win for the popular Adult Air Cannon category as well as claim to a new world championship distance.\n\nDistances were held down somewhat Sunday as winds near 15 mph and gusts near 20 mph bore directly into the faces of competitors and their rigs. Some also said that more pumpkin launches than usual disintegrated shortly after going airborne this year, a phenomenon that some speculated was the result of heavy rains early in the pumpkin growing season.\n\nThe contest ended with a bang as last year's defending champion, Milton, Del.-based Young Glory III, blasted off a 30-foot section of its barrel in the last shot of the day. Young Glory set a 4,483.51-foot record in 2008 that held until Sunday.\n\n\"We gave it all we had, which we normally don't, but under the circumstances, we did, and the barrel came out -- it just blew 500 feet or so,\" said Jake Burton, team captain. \"The pumpkin was in that section, and there were pumpkin chips flying in every direction.\n\n\"This thing was cranked up 25 to 30% higher than it normally is,\" Burton said. \"It definitely had a different tone to it when it blew.\"\n\nBrian Labrie, American Chunker's captain and the owner of a landscaping company, said he and other team members scouted the 2009 Punkin Chunkin before designing their 120-foot, red, white and blue rig. The team, which draws heavily from engineering and scientific fields, recruited a team last year from FLIR Systems, a global producer of thermal imaging systems and analytic techniques, to help fine tune its launches.\n\n\"We're very happy and we've made a tremendous number of friends down here,\" Donald Gross, an American Chunker team member, said. \"We're looking forward to coming back.\"\n\nThe Punkin Chunkin began in 1986 with a casual challenge among mechanically adventurous friends in a small field near Georgetown, Del., with the longest shot measured at 126 feet. Over the years the annual event has become a sizable fall tourism attraction, with attendance topping 20,000, and a large contributor to charitable causes. This year's competition drew 115 teams in 15 categories, with competitors coming from as far away as Australia.\n\nSpinoffs have taken root across the country, and Discovery Communications has emerged as a major sponsor, with the Science Channel scheduling a Thanksgiving Day special on the contest.\n\nPunkin Chunkin approaches ranged from simple human tosses and Rube Goldberg theatricals to elaborate, engine-powered mechanical spinners, medieval-technology catapults and twisted-rope \"torsion\" flingers. Compressed air cannons, with 21 teams and sometimes-massive profiles, accounted for the most entries.\n\nEvery scheme had enthusiasts, however.\n\nBob Carbo, whose Team Onager has competed since 1995, was cheered by others in his category as \"the grandfather of torsion\" Sunday after his tightly-wound rig notched a 3,105-foot toss and won the category.\n\n\"Incredible. A dream come true,\" said Carbo, who competed in a medieval-style chainmail suit and helmet. \"To get into the 3,000-foot club is a huge thing.\"\n\nButch Lanasa of Baltimore took up a spot early in the day behind the air cannons with his wife and daughter's family.\n\n\"This is where the big ones are,\" said Lanasa, who owns a second home in the Salisbury, Md., area. Lanasa said that his daughter and son-in-law picked the spot, adding: \"I just like to see it. They've started one in Maryland now, but we already planned to come to this one.\"\n\nRalph Eschborn, captain of Big 10 Inch air cannon, this year's second-place winner, said he was hoping for a completely unofficial consolation win of the average longest throw over three attempts. Big 10 Inch's more-than 3,800 foot third shot Sunday bested American Chunker's but made no difference in the final outcome.\n\n\"Second place is first loser, but we've got fire in our belly now,\" Eschborn said. \"We'll be back.\"\n\nBig 10 has multiple wins in Delaware, and holds a Guinness Book of Records mark for a 5,545.42 launch in Utah, in thinner air, nevertheless making it the first launcher to break 1 mile.\n\nFrank Shade, one of the event's organizers and managers, said that he had not heard of any problems caused by the final round barrel failure. Although final crowd estimates were not available, Shade said.\n\n\"The campground and parking area were full on Saturday.

A previous lawsuit against the organization had raised questions about Punkin Chunkin's safety.\n\nA former event volunteer sued the venue owner in 2013 for injuries sustained in an ATV accident during Punkin Chunkin. Although the suit was eventually dismissed, the land owner immediately evicted the event, which was suspended in 2014 and 2015 during the search for a new venue.\n\nDuring its two-year break, officials looked into moving from its longtime Bridgeville home to an area near Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and even considered moving it out of state, eyeing multiple Maryland locations.\n\nWheatley Farms agreed to take on the event, which drew about 100,000 people last year, and therefore took on any and all safety concerns associated with the competition on their property, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe farm and farm owners failed \"to use reasonable care in ensuring that the activities being engaged on their property in the presence of thousands of lawful invitees was safe,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nPunkin Chunkin again expressed sympathy to Dakessian, who said in the lawsuit that she has been left with severe and permanent injuries because of negligence and wrongful conduct by the defendants.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that Suzanne Dakessian was injured, and we continue to extend our best wishes to her, her family and her loved ones,\" Punkin Chunkin's statement said, adding they will make no further comment.\n\nRELATED:Lack of funding may squash Punkin Chunkin\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED:Trap door explodes, hits woman in the head\n\nDakessian's lawsuit seeks, among other things, economic and non-economic damages, as well as compensation for past and future pain and suffering and other relief the court deems just.\n\nThe airing of the scheduled three-hour special never happened, and organizers last year said little about the future of Punkin Chunkin, other than that they hoped to see it continue.\n\nThe annual event draws thousands to the Bridgeville area, where homemade air cannons fire pumpkins thousands of feet into farm fields. Many competitors traveled from across the country to compete in the \"world famous\" event.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Frank Payton, president of the World Punkin Chunkin Championship Association, said that without more sponsors, the November Punkin Chunkin could be the last. The statement posted to Facebook Wednesday gives no indication of the event's future in Delaware.\n\nThe Science Channel had already pulled out of the event and did not plan to return this year, Payton told reporters earlier this year.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

We have more of a base here.”\n\nPunkin Chunkin, along with everything else, was put on hold in 2020 due to the pandemic. Via social media, organizers asked followers to search for land “in states with favorable liability laws.”\n\n“We’d love to stay on Delmarva; that’s the biggest thing,” Quigley said, although “Marva” would be more accurate.\n\nHe said the organization is looking to slow down, downsize and return to its family-friendly roots.\n\n“In Illinois, we allowed people, especially the kids, to get up close to the machines before we started shooting,” Quigley said. “When we have too many machines, it’s a lot of stress on everybody to get things done.

The century-old company operates 162 stores in five other Mid-Atlantic states.\n\n“I would expect shoppers who visit Food Lion now will not find significantly higher prices at Weis Markets,” said Terri Maloney, editorial director of the trade publications Food World and Food Trade News. “Weis is also publicly traded, but family owned, so they have more of a focus on local produce, baked goods and fresh meats.”\n\nWhile the purchase may be a boon for some consumers, the transition means about 200 Food Lion employees will be asked to reapply for their jobs.\n\n“Typically, when we acquire stores we send people around to introduce ourselves and ask associates if they are interested in coming to work for us,” Weis spokesman Dennis Curtin said. “The vast majority end up joining us and that’s what we’re hoping for in this situation as well.”\n\nSTORY: Two new Chipotles coming to New Castle County\n\nSTORY: Fresh Market, Wawa now hiring for new Rehoboth stores\n\nCurtin declined to say how many employees the company expects to retain. He also declined to comment on whether employees who secure jobs with Weis would see a change in their wages or benefits. All employees at the four stores are non-union.\n\nStaff at three of the four stores declined to comment Monday.\n\nA longtime worker at the Food Lion on North Village Main Boulevard near Lewes who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he expects Weis to hire all 65 employees at that location.\n\n“They told us months ago that this might happen and we’re looking for a smooth transition,” he said. “Right now, we’re just focused on taking care of our customers.”\n\nThe sale comes as Food Lion’s parent company prepares for a corporate merger that will create one of the largest food retailers in the United States.\n\nDutch grocer Royal Ahold NV agreed last summer to buy its Belgian rival Delhaize for $28 billion. The merger is expected to bring Ahold’s Stop & Shop and Giant stores under the same umbrella as Delhaize’s Food Lion and Hannaford markets.\n\nThe deal is still pending before the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. But the companies last week announced plans to sell off 86 U.S. stores to a variety of buyers in a bid to remove lingering concerns over the unified conglomerate operating too many stores in certain markets.\n\nDelhaize Group will sell off 71 stores, while Ahold will sell off 15.\n\nNone of those sales will be finalized until the merger wins final approval, said Delhaize spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown.\n\nShe declined to say how the four Sussex County locations were chosen. Food Lion operates 22 stores in Delaware, including a dozen in Sussex County.\n\nTwo new Chipotles coming to New Castle County\n\nThe Ahold and Delhaize merger is the latest in a series of shakeups and consolidations in the supermarket industry.\n\nMinnesota-based SuperValu sold the Acme brand and four other supermarket chains to a consortium called AB Acquisition LLC for $3.3 billion in early 2013. Early last year, that company merged with Safeway to form the nation’s second largest supermarket chain behind Kroger.\n\nLast summer, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. – better known as A&P – sold off or closed all of its supermarkets before going belly up after 156 years in business. A&P’s bankruptcy resulted in the closure of five grocery stores in Delaware.\n\n“Food retail is arguably the most competitive industry in the United States,” said analyst Andrew Wolfe of BB&T Capital Markets. “In the last 20 years, we’ve seen a lot of consolidation as companies try to achieve the economies of scale of a Walmart. At the same time, you’ve seen a shift toward healthier, fresher foods, which tends to help chains like Whole Foods.”\n\nShedding a few stores now could help Ahold and Delhaize better compete in the future against some of the world’s largest chains, he said.\n\n“Buyers like Weis tend to get a good price in a situation like this,” Wolfe said. “And adding these stores will allow them to expand without having to add any additional distribution infrastructure.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/20/after-shooting-man-16-year-old-boy-returns-home-and-waits-police-court-records-say/355347002/", "title": "After shooting man, boy returns home to wait for police, records say", "text": "After shooting an 18-year-old man in the chest Sunday night, Derrick Caudle told authorities he tried to help the dying victim before eventually returning to his Middletown home where he sat on steps and waited for police to arrive, according to court documents obtained by The News Journal.\n\nCaudle, 16, is charged with first-degree murder and possessing a firearm while committing a felony.

His efforts were opposed by the Delaware Trial Lawyers Association and never materialized.\n\nSo, \"If the event can’t be a Delaware tradition, we want it to remain a Delmarva tradition,” the Punkin Chunkin release states.\n\nThe event began in 1986 in Milton and later moved to Bridgeville. The competition took place for decades without significant issues and gained popularity, becoming a source of pride for Sussex County.\n\nIt was televised in 2002 on the Discovery Channel and in later years on the Science Channel.\n\nIn 2013, however, a lawsuit was filed over a volunteer’s all-terrain vehicle accident at the 2011 event. It was eventually dismissed, but caused the landowner to back out. Insurance woes began around this time, too.\n\nHISTORY:Punkin Chunkin's Delaware history, from its humble beginnings to trouble in recent years\n\nRELATED:Punkin Chunkin canceled in light of pending lawsuit\n\nPunkin Chunkin planned to move to Dover International Speedway in 2014, but the event was canceled a month before it was scheduled to occur and again the next year.\n\n“The Chunk” made a triumphant return to the Bridgeville area in 2016, but at that event, a television producer was seriously injured after being struck in the head by a metal plate that flew off an air cannon.\n\nShe sued, but her case was also later dismissed.\n\nPunkin Chunkin was canceled for the next two years as organizers struggled with insurance costs and eventually started looking outside the area. In 2019, the event moved to Rantoul, Illinois.\n\nPunkin Chunkin was smaller but still successful in Illinois, Quigley said, where it attracted about 35 competing teams and 10,000 spectators.\n\nThere have been as many as 150 teams and 40,000 spectators at Delaware Punkin Chunkins, according to Quigley.\n\nRELATED:Woman injured at Punkin Chunkin files federal lawsuit against Delaware officials, organizers\n\n“Illinois was a challenge because the majority of people involved live on the East Coast,” he said. “It’s a lot of moving because all of the equipment is here. We have more of a base here.”\n\nPunkin Chunkin, along with everything else, was put on hold in 2020 due to the pandemic. Via social media, organizers asked followers to search for land “in states with favorable liability laws.”\n\n“We’d love to stay on Delmarva; that’s the biggest thing,” Quigley said, although “Marva” would be more accurate.\n\nHe said the organization is looking to slow down, downsize and return to its family-friendly roots.\n\n“In Illinois, we allowed people, especially the kids, to get up close to the machines before we started shooting,” Quigley said. “When we have too many machines, it’s a lot of stress on everybody to get things done.

Steven Floyd Sr., the corrections officer killed during the deadly prison takeover Feb. 1 at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, said she has been \"threatened by lawyers for the state\" demanding the repayment of her husband's funeral expenses, according to a statement released by her attorneys.\n\nSaundra M. Floyd also said in the statement, issued by the Neuberger Firm, that she has decided not to meet with Gov. John Carney this week.\n\n\"Today the Governor's office called me and asked if he could stop by this Friday to see how my family is doing,\" she said in the statement dated Wednesday. \"But actions speak louder than words, so my answer to that is no.\"\n\nThe family said they have not been told how Floyd died and want Carney or someone from the state to tell them.\n\n\"Just reply privately or publicly to my demand for the release of the autopsy of my husband,\" she said in her statement. \"How did he die? Did he suffer greatly, or did he pass quickly? Was he tortured? Was he stabbed 100 times, as we have heard? Did he die in a great pool of blood, as is rumored? Please end our suffering and help us move on. Overrule the State's many lawyers and address our suffering. Respect the memory of my dear husband and my family that much.\"\n\nA Carney spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, said it would be inappropriate to publicly address the questions posed by Wilmington attorney Thomas S. Neuberger, who along with the firm of Jacobs & Crumplar, represent Floyd's family and estate.\n\n\"Mr. Neuberger has already suggested he plans to sue the state and seems intent on trying his case in the press,\" Starkey said.\n\nStarkey said Carney had hoped to meet with the Floyd family to check in and offer his continued thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. \"He still hopes to do so,\" Starkey said.\n\nWilmington attorney Thomas Crumplar said lawyers for the state met with Floyd's widow and asked her to sign workers' compensation documents. This occurred a day before the Floyd family retained Crumplar and Neuberger.\n\nAfter being retained, Crumplar said he asked the state for more time to review the documents.\n\n\"I immediately told the state to put a hold on all the workers' comp,\" he said. \"And in their responses, they want her to pay back the funeral bills.\"\n\nCrumplar said the funeral costs amount to about $24,000.\n\nSTORY: Prison siege choreographed; officers beaten for hours\n\nSTORY: More resignations, reassignments at Delaware prisons\n\nLast week, Floyd's family delivered a letter to Carney's office asking the governor to fix the state's \"broken\" Department of Correction and for justice to be served in Floyd's death.\n\nThat letter was delivered on March 6 by Floyd's attorneys, who are considering filing a civil rights violation lawsuit against former Govs. Ruth Ann Minner and Jack Markell and senior prison staff claiming that the state failed to implement necessary changes to its prisons. Her attorneys also represent two corrections officers held hostage during the siege and three maintenance workers who managed to barricade themselves in a basement after inmates took over Building C.\n\nIn last week's three-page letter, Neuberger said that while Steven Floyd cared about the DOC, the state and prison system did not feel the same about him.\n\nWhile Floyd put his trust in previous governors, that letter said that the lieutenant and other corrections officers were not provided basic tools and resources needed to do their jobs in a \"snake pit.\" Because of that failure, Floyd paid the \"ultimate price.\"\n\nNeuberger points to the 2004 abduction and sexual assault of a Vaughn prison counselor by serial rapist Scott A. Miller.\n\nAn internal report filed by the state did not say what caused the July 12, 2004, hostage situation that ended in Miller's shooting death. But then-Gov. Minner commissioned a task force to look at security lapses. Minner's task force issued its report in February 2005 blaming the incident on DOC's management and making dozens of recommendations to improve the safety of employees and inmates.\n\nThe state DOC is authorized to hire 1,802 correctional officers, but as of this week employed 1,669.\n\nOn Monday, Carney said he wants to add 75 corrections officers and buy new safety equipment for prison staffers. In the short term, Carney has authorized $340,000 to purchase protective gear and communications equipment. His administration also has increased the frequency of random security sweeps at Vaughn by specialized teams.\n\nHis administration said it hopes hiring more officers will cut down on overtime – employee shortages have forced officers to work lengthy hours beyond their standard work week, which both costs the state money and leads to fatigue and diminished morale.\n\nCarney also announced that an independent review of the 18-hour hostage crisis will start this week. That inquiry will be led by retired Supreme Court Justice Henry duPont Ridgely and retired Family Court Judge William L. Chapman Jr.\n\nCarney had originally said the review would start after State Police and the DOC finished their criminal investigations, but on Monday he said the \"duration of the criminal investigation and his sense of urgency surrounding this issue\" spurred him to go ahead with the review.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/11/why-seaford-wants-corporations-to-vote-in-town-elections/70203037007/", "title": "Why this Delaware town wants corporations to vote in its local ...", "text": "Seaford, one of the biggest cities in Sussex County, already allows nonresident property owners to vote in local elections.\n\nTwo other Sussex County towns, Henlopen Acres and Fenwick Island, have similar provisions to the one proposed in Seaford.\n\nSeaford Mayor David Genshaw is a supporter of the legislation, believing it will help increase voter turnout for people who are “investing money in our city.”\n\nThe vote to send this legislation out of committee Wednesday was a unanimous bipartisan vote, yet Democratic lawmakers vocalized their hesitation.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect Majority Whip Melissa Minor-Brown's correct title.\n\nDelaware lawmakers voted a bill out of committee Wednesday that would allow artificial entities – limited liability companies, corporations and trusts – to vote in municipal elections in Seaford.\n\nThis concept is rare, with nonresident owners of these entities being allowed to vote in just a few other Delaware towns.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it, you look like an idiot if you don’t have it,” said David D’Arezzo, a former executive at Dollar General, Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag, it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”\n\nCovid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers.

Anger would hardly begin to describe your feelings, but then imagine how you and your daughter would feel if she became pregnant and the man who abused her got custody of the child and your daughter had to pay him child support for the next 18 years.\n\nThis would not only be unthinkable in our society but most people would say that it bordered on abuse or worse. Yet, as reported in a recent Arizona Republic news story, this is what happened to Nick Olivas, who happened to be 14 at the time he had sex with a 20-year-old woman. The difference, of course, is he’s not a girl.\n\nAt the age of 21, Olivas found out he had a child and that he owed over $15,000 in back child support plus interest. He was rightfully upset, stating: “It was a shock. I was living my life and enjoying being young. To find out you have a 6-year-old? It’s unexplainable. It freaked me out.”\n\nWhen a state government finds out a 14-year-old girl is a statutory rape victim of a 20-year-old man, the common reaction would be to file criminal charges to put the predator in jail. But for male victims, child support laws turn state governments into the allies of abusers instead of advocates for the victims.\n\nWhy the double standard when the victim is male?\n\nThe main reason is that the law says so. According to a 2011 article in the Georgia Law Review “much of the law relating to child support is based on the fact that it is typically in a child’s best interest to receive financial support from mothers as well as fathers” even when there is “wrongful conduct by the mother.”\n\nSuch laws date back to the 16th century, but today across the United States, state laws are driven by a series of incentives and penalties in federal law to enforce child support laws so strictly that there is little room for such nuances as rape. As a result, courts hold boys responsible for the consequences of being raped. In a case involving a 15-year-old California boy raped by a 34-year-old woman who gave birth in 1995, the courts declared, “Victims have rights. Here, the victim also has responsibilities.”\n\nIn Kansas, the courts said the same thing about a 13-year-old boy raped by his 17-year-old babysitter. In Ohio, courts have ordered child support in a case involving a 15-year-old boy and a 19-year-old woman. Sexual abuse of men and boys by women is far from unheard of. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 5 million men and boys have been “forced to penetrate” and that 80 percent of the perpetrators were women.\n\nMale victims of statutory rape are thought of as culpable for child support because, as males, they are not seen as victims, but always as perpetrators of sex, no matter how young. After all, they were asking for it and should have kept their pants zipped. Isn’t this what we used to say about female victims of sexual abuse?\n\nHelen Smith is a forensic psychologist and author of Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream — and Why It Matters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/04"}]}

In Maryland, it’s $48,510, which will increase to $60,000 by July 2026. New Jersey's average starting teaching salary is $54,053, while Pennsylvania's is $46,991.\n\nAt the beginning of this school year, about 5% of educator jobs statewide − more than 500 positions − were unfilled. It’s the result of long-term issues that have been brewing for years and became only worse with the onset of COVID-19. The pandemic led to a high number of retirements and an increase in student enrollment, with fewer college students entering the field.\n\nCarney, in his 2024 fiscal year budget, plans to request an across-the-board 3% wage increase for all people working in schools. For those who work directly with children, these state employees will receive an additional 6% increase.\n\nThe governor also in his announcement pledged to increase opportunity funding to more than $50 million, which will go to low-income students and English learners at Delaware public schools.\n\nMore money will also go to the Wilmington Learning Collaborative, a governing board that plans to oversee and improve outcomes for children in schools that are within city limits.\n\nIn a brief interview following his announcement, Carney alluded to likely raises for other state employees, which he said will be announced during his State of the State address Thursday. He noted how the state is losing many of its employees to the private sector, including Amazon.\n\nHe declined to provide specific details but said it will be a “larger range than what I've seen in my 30 years of doing this.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/delaware-democrats-politics-2024-election-tom-carper-retiring/70255843007/", "title": "Delaware Democrats eye 'generational shift' in 2024 election", "text": "Democratic campaign consultants, organizers and party observers believe the 2024 election will be one of the state’s most important election cycles in decades.\n\nFor the first time in about half a century, Tom Carper will not be in elected office in 2025.\n\nThe election will also likely feature several competitive Democratic primary races – a rarity for the state party.\n\nIt did not take long for the phone lines to begin burning up after U.S. Sen.

Tom Carper, a patriarch of modern Delaware politics, will retire next year, ending a career as one of the most successful politicians in state history.\n\nHis announcement Monday at the Wilmington Riverfront will undoubtedly shake up the state, with now an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\n\"While nothing is forever, the Delaware Democratic Party is blessed today with a bench as strong as any I’ve ever seen in the 50 years that I’ve called Delaware home,\" Carper said in a prepared speech. \"If there was ever an opportune time to step aside and pass the torch to the next generation, it’s coming, and it will be here on January 3, 2025.\n\n\"But, until then, God willing, I’ll continue working 60-hour weeks and coming home on the train most nights as long as Martha keeps leaving the light on for me.\"\n\nCarper has been in statewide public office since 1977, serving as Delaware treasurer, congressman, governor and senator. He helped establish Delaware Democrats’ now longstanding ideology of socially liberal but center on economic and fiscal issues.\n\nAnd he has been one of the most prominent representations of “The Delaware Way\" − a less adversarial approach to politics that prioritizes building consensus. Yet critics have also derided this mentality for its behind-the-scenes politicking.\n\nThroughout the decades, he remained popular with Delaware voters. In 2018, he faced his most challenging primary in years when he faced then-newcomer Kerri Evelyn Harris, who is now a state representative in the Delaware General Assembly.\n\nCarper defeated her by a 30-point margin, ultimately capturing 60% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBefore running for reelection in 2018, Carper said at the time that he considered retiring. But that changed with former President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.\n\nIt’s hard to find an elected Delaware official, and their respective deputy, who has not campaigned, interned or worked for the politician. Known as “Carper Town,” there’s an intricate web of connections, careers and marriages that can be traced back to the senior senator.\n\nFor years, many have viewed Delaware’s lone congresswoman Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester as the heir apparent to Carper’s seat. Delaware has never elected a woman or person of color to the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut Gov. John Carney, whose career trajectory has been very similar to Carper’s, is in his final term as governor. He has not indicated what his future plans will be.\n\nTom Carper’s political history\n\nCarper, born in West Virginia and raised in Virginia, first came to Delaware in 1973 as an M.B.A. student at the University of Delaware. He had served as a naval flight officer in the Vietnam War, making Carper the only remaining Vietnam veteran in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThree years later, at age 29, he was elected as Delaware’s state treasurer. The Delaware Democratic Party was in the midst of transformation, in part from Joe Biden’s shocking upset against Caleb Boggs in the 1972 U.S. Senate race.\n\nThe two have been friends for decades. Carper noted in his speech that it was Biden, who calls him Tommy, who encouraged him to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nCarper served as Delaware’s sole congressman for a decade, then as Delaware governor for two terms before running for U.S. Senate in 2000. One of Carper’s signature achievements as governor was his role in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront, where he made his announcement Monday.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, Carper has been vocal on climate change, serving as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. He has also led the quest to make Washington, D.C. the country’s 51st state.\n\nCarper, in his speech, spoke of his efforts to \"help center and clean up the Democratic Party,\" which \"have borne great fruit.\" Democrats control every statewide seat in Delaware.\n\nIs age a factor in Carper's retirement?\n\nCarper, at age 76, is not considered to be one of the older U.S. senators. The reelection bid of 80-year-old Biden and the health decline of 89-year-old U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, has put renewed scrutiny on the age and well-being of U.S. politicians.\n\nMaryland U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, 79, recently announced his retirement earlier this month, citing his age as one of the factors in his decision.\n\nFor about a decade now, Carper has fiercely pushed back on questions of his health, primarily lobbed by opponents. When asked about his health during a campaign event in 2012, Carper responded by doing more than 30 push-ups on a folding table as supporters cheered.\n\nCarper, in his speech, did not cite a specific reason for retirement.\n\n\"As last year came to a close and the new one began,\" he said in his speech, \"Martha and I began to focus on what I should do next - run for a fifth term in the Senate which - if I won - would be a record 15 statewide elections or ride off into the sunset and call it a day.\"\n\n\"After a good deal of prayer and introspection, and more than a few heart-to-heart conversations, we've decided I should do neither but, rather, run through the tape over the next 20 months...\"\n\nWhat Carper is known for\n\nThe senator is also known for his quirks. He famously drove a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country minivan , called the “Silver Bullet,” for two decades, racking up close to 600,000 miles.\n\nIn his final 20 months in office, Carper said he plans to help implement the significant climate provisions he helped write that passed in the infrastructure and inflation laws recently passed by Congress.\n\nHe called representing Delaware in public office as the “great privilege” of his life.\n\n“I’ve never felt the gratitude and affection of so many Delawareans as I feel today when traveling through our Small Wonder,\" he said in his speech. \"It is palpable, it is a source of joy, and it is deeply, deeply appreciated.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/21/lisa-blunt-rochester-delaware-senate-race-2024-elections-tom-carper/70329181007/", "title": "Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to ...", "text": "U.S. Rep.

Democrats voted down all of them.\n\nSome of those amendments would have delayed the minimum wage increase for some or all businesses. Others would have allowed small businesses or nonprofits to pay a lower rate, while some amendments would have required the state to study and report the higher wage's impact on the economy.\n\nOne Democrat — freshman Rep. Rae Moore, D-Middletown — sponsored an amendment to delay the wage increase by one year for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. She was the only Democrat to vote for it.\n\nMoore won her seat in the November election thanks to support from progressive organizations such as the Delaware Working Families Party.\n\nWhile they did endorse Moore during the election, the Delaware Working Families Party does not support the amendment, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nDuring Thursday's debate, Republicans argued that the wage increase would hurt businesses — especially the ones that have already suffered financial loss during the pandemic. Some also raised concerns about how much the increase would cost the state.\n\n\"This is the wrong time,\" said Rep. Ron Gray, R-Selbyville.\n\nDemocrats argue that workers have also suffered from the pandemic and that an increased minimum wage is long overdue.\n\nAccording to an official financial analysis, it would cost the state an extra $3.7 million per year by 2024 to increase wages for low-paid public employees.

Community groups stood by to help. Reporters and camera crews staked out airports.\n\nBut the plane – and the migrants – never showed.\n\nThe confusing drama was among the latest chapters in an ongoing spat between Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has captured headlines and put a spotlight on Biden's border policies.\n\nExclusive poll:Trump vs. DeSantis in 2024? Poll shows Florida Republicans prefer their governor\n\nAnalysis:How DeSantis decision could help a 2024 showdown with Trump\n\nDeSantis, a Republican who is considered a likely presidential candidate in 2024, has threatened to send migrants captured at the border to \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" around the country.\n\nLast week, he followed through on that threat and flew 48 Venezuelan people from the San Antonio airport to Martha's Vineyard on two private planes. When they arrived, the Venezuelan migrants told reporters they had lured by individuals who falsely promised them jobs and rent-free places to stay. They filed a class-action lawsuit against DeSantis and other officials on Tuesday seeking unspecified damages.\n\nA federal class action lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Boston on behalf of the migrants that accuses the DeSantis administration of deploying a “fraudulent and discriminatory scheme” to transport them. On Monday, Bexar County, Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar announced his agency had opened an investigation into how 48 Venezuelan migrants were “lured” to board flights from San Antonio to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nOnPolitics newsletter:Is Trump fading? DeSantis rising as 2024 prospect in USA TODAY/Suffolk poll\n\nStay in the conversation:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCrist, Hispanic leaders blast DeSantis\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist joined with Hispanic leaders Wednesday to keep the heat on DeSantis for using more than $1.5 million of Florida taxpayer money on the Martha’s Vineyard flight.\n\nCrist called the action a “premeditated crime,” by his rival in the Nov. 8 election.\n\n“To utilize human beings for his political gain is shameful,” Crist said.\n\nAmong those joining DeSantis on a Zoom call with reporters were Massachusetts state Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, a Springfield Democrat; Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami; and Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, based in South Florida.\n\nDeSantis tapped a $12 million fund approved by the Republican-led Legislature to relocate unauthorized aliens from Florida to other locations. But Crist and other Democrats say the governor misused the dollars by sending two aircraft to Texas to retrieve asylum-seekers in that state and send them to the wealthy island, what DeSantis later described as “greener pastures.”\n\nA plane to Delaware from Texas?\n\nMonday night, reports surfaced that another plane was scheduled to depart Texas on Tuesday and then head to the Delaware Coastal Airport, about 20 miles west of Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach. Flight plans filed late Monday indicated the plane would travel from San Antonio to Delaware, with a short layover in Crestview, Florida.\n\nBut what actually happened remains fuzzy.\n\nThe plane had not left Texas as of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, but Delaware Gov. John Carney’s spokesperson Emily David Hershman said the governor's office was aware of the reports and was preparing for the potential arrival.\n\nReporters and photographers from the USA TODAY network looked for signs of the aircraft in Texas and Florida. No plane took off. No plane landed.\n\nOfficials later said no plane is expected.\n\n\"We have no reports of anyone arriving at this point,\" said Jill Fredel of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services after officials waited for hours for the plane to arrive at Delaware Coastal Airport in Sussex County.\n\nOpinion:Ron DeSantis' Martha's Vineyard stunt cruelly uses migrants as human pawns, helping no one\n\nIn Okaloosa County, Florida, where the plane was to stop briefly, officials said they don't receive passenger manifests for flights like the one reportedly bound for Delaware. County spokeswomen April Sarver said the county isn't even allowed to ask for such documents.\n\nMuch of what officials learn, she said, comes from the public, who might be using apps to trace flights coming in from Texas or just passing rumors back and forth on social media.\n\n\"We get to hear the rumors too, but we wouldn't get anything official,\" Sarver said. \"I sure would like it if Gov. DeSantis would call and give me a head's up.\"\n\n'INHUMANE ACTS':Massachusetts seeks human trafficking probe targeting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over migrants\n\nWhite House responds\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was aware of reports that a plane was heading to Delaware. The White House was in \"close contact\" with Delaware officials, but had not been in touch with DeSantis or his administration, she said.\n\n“Our heads up did not come from Gov. DeSantis because his only goal, as he's made it really quite clear, is to create chaos and using immigrants fleeing communism as political pawns,” Jean-Pierre said. “So it's about creating political theater for him. It's not about getting to a solution.”\n\nBiden, asked later about reports that DeSantis was sending migrants to Delaware, told reporters: “He should come visit. We have a beautiful shoreline.”\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, refused to confirm to reporters in Florida whether he had ordered more migrants from Texas be sent to Delaware. But he defended his plan to steer migrants apprehended at the border away from Florida and send them to “sanctuary jurisdictions” around the country.\n\nHe also kept up his drumbeat of intense criticism of Biden’s border security policies.\n\nDeSantis counters: Where's anger for Biden?\n\nIn Bradenton, DeSantis questioned why those denouncing his migrant plan aren’t expressing anger with Biden for allowing dozens of migrants to die last June in and around a tractor-trailer in San Antonio. “I heard no outrage about that,” he said.\n\n\"I don’t hear outrage about the criminal aliens who have gotten through and victimized people... throughout the country, but you have 50 that end up in Martha's Vineyard, then they get really upset,\" DeSantis said.\n\nBiden’s border security policies are “doing huge damage to our country,” he said, and “nobody can deny there's a crisis.”\n\nDeSantis said his plan took shape last year when he took a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border to help Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deal with the border crisis.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported Monday that the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants along the southwestern border — for the first time — had surpassed 2 million this fiscal year, which ends at the end of the month.\n\n'SOLUTIONS AND NOT THEATER':Rep.

The No. 1 slot was maintained by perennial first-place holder, Spelman College, of Atlanta.\n\nFAMU bested two other public HBCUs, Delaware State University and its previous arch-rival, North Carolina A&T University, which placed eighth and ninth, respectively in the 2023 guide, to earn the top public HBCU ranking.\n\nAnd, for those keeping score, an added caveat from Monday’s report is that FAMU’s No. 7 slot in the top 10 ranked public or private HBCUs makes it the top-ranked member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference institutions. Jackson State University was next closest at No. 19, and Bethune Cookman University tied for No. 49, among HBCUs with SWAC members Grambling State and Texas Southern universities.\n\nFAMU President Larry Robinson was pleased with the university increasing to No. 103 among national public universities and its ranking among HBCUs.\n\n“FAMU continues to carve a path forward in educating and training our graduates to have an impact in the communities where they live, work and serve,” Robinson said in a prepared statement. “These rankings are no reason for complacency. They will encourage and inspire us to even greater achievements. We have more work to do.”\n\nRobinson said the improved ranking reflects the commitment and hard work of students, faculty, and staff under challenging circumstances.\n\nFAMU in the headlines:\n\nThe Board of Trustees’ recent approval of FAMU’s new five-year strategic plan, “Boldly Striking,” also dovetails with the latest rankings and illustrates where FAMU is headed, the university noted in an announcement of the rankings.\n\nThe strategic plan will be discussed this week by the Board of Governors. The board also is seeking an update from the university on recent housing woes on campus and compliance and eligibility issues within the athletics department.\n\nDuring the President’s Convocation Friday, Robinson noted the Class of 2026 has a 3.91 incoming grade point average.\n\nBoard of Trustees Chairman Kelvin Lawson was encouraged by the news of the university’s showing in the U.S. News & World Report publication.\n\n“I’m excited by our continued rise in the rankings. It’s confirmation that we are moving in the right direction despite our short-term challenges,” Lawson said in a prepared statement. “I am convinced our new strategic plan creates the framework for even greater improvements in the coming years.”\n\nContact Democrat Community/Opinion Editor Byron Dobson at bdobson@tallahassee.com or on Twitter @byrondobson.\n\nTop 10 HBCUs: 2023\n\nNo. 1: Spelman College, private; 100 points\n\nNo. 2: Howard University, private; 87 points\n\nNo. 3: Tuskegee University, private; 82 points\n\nNo. 4: Morehouse College, private; 75 points\n\nNo. 5: Xavier University of Louisiana, private; 73 points\n\nNo. 6: Hampton University, private; 72 points\n\nNo. 7: Florida A&M University, public, 68 points\n\nNo. 8: Delaware State University, public; 63 points\n\nNo. 9: Claflin University, private; 61 points\n\nNo. 9 North Carolina A&T University, public; 61 points\n\nSource: U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Colleges 2023” guidebook\n\nHow SWAC institutions ranked among HBCUs rated:\n\nNo. 7: Florida A&M University\n\nNo. 19: Jackson State University\n\nNo. 23: Alcorn State University\n\nNo. 26: Prairie View State University\n\nNo. 26: Southern University\n\nNo. 31: Alabama State University\n\nNo. 31: University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff\n\nNo. 40: Alabama A&M University\n\nNo. 45: Mississippi Valley State\n\nNo. 49: Bethune-Cookman University\n\nNo. 49: Grambling University\n\nNo. 49: Texas Southern University\n\nSource: U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Colleges 2023” guidebook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/09/18/delaware-state-university-lands-among-top-10-historically-black-colleges-universities-united-states/70892641007/", "title": "Delaware State University lands among the top 10 HBCUs in the ...", "text": "Delaware's only HBCU remained among the top Historically Black Colleges and Universities ranked by U.S. News and World Report this week.\n\nOn Monday, Delaware State University shared its position as the No. 3 public and No. 9 overall among more than 100 HBCUs across the country. Though falling one position in both sections — from No. 2 and No. 8 last year — it remains the third consecutive year Delaware State has landed in the top 10 overall, and the ninth within the public rankings' top 5.\n\n\"This year’s ranking demonstrates our continued commitment to excellence in academic programming and student support services.

The university now shares its No. 9 spot at a tie with Claflin University in South Carolina.\n\nDelaware State hopes to pair these rankings with continued expansion of its research portfolio and increased recruitment of male students in education. This follows growth in the Aviation Program, adding helicopter training to its roster, the launching of an Early Childhood Innovation Center, and the successful integration of Wesley College, now the home of College of Health and Behavioral Sciences at DSU Downtown.\n\nWhat the university deemed \"most notable\" in its rankings this year were momentum in retention and graduation, social mobility — or success in graduating students from low-resource communities — innovation and leadership in undergraduate teaching.\n\nThe HBCU also unveiled some new logos last month, updating both its academic emblem and the hornet logo for university athletics. Refreshed branding was meant to capture DelState's growth over the last decade.\n\nThe university has also battled some student unrest on campus since winter 2023, when students protested for improved campus safety and handling of sexual assault cases. University response is reportedly ongoing, as a Safe Space Coalition formed under President Tony Allen, alongside funding for a \"Safe Space Project” to be housed at DSU Downtown to assist in its sexual assault response and prevention program.\n\nLynda Murray-Jackson, Delaware State's associate vice president of institutional effectiveness, said the strong ranking isn't about the trials — but \"is a testament to the consistent ability of our faculty and staff to deliver a quality education to our students, to achieve strong levels of student persistence, and to expand the ever-increasing profile of the institution.\"\n\nDSU president:'It isn't what we say or think that defines us, but what we do' | Opinion\n\nAcross institutions, U.S. News general methodology has come under fire as of late.

Parents and students use the rankings, found at usnews.com/bestcolleges, to conduct research on schools.\n\nU.S. News uses a variety of factors to compile its lists. That now includes an analysis of the graduation rates of students who receive Pell Grants, federal subsidies for low-income students, and the differences in graduation rates of Pell Grant students and students who didn't receive this funding.\n\nAs part of another methodology shift, the category called student outcomes, which was weighted 30 percent last year, is now at 35 percent.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Delaware's various colleges and universities did this year:\n\nHere's where DSU lands on the top HBCU list:\n\n10.

North Carolina A&T, based in Greensboro, placed eighth this year.\n\n“Moving up 13 places is a testament to our focus on student success and the dedication of our faculty, staff and students to the tenets of our strategic plan, FAMU Rising,” FAMU President Larry Robinson, said in a release. “Our intentionality and teamwork allow us to focus acutely on opportunities and more effectively address challenges.”\n\nThe university is hosting a celebration of its rankings during a public event at 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Lawson Center.\n\nThe university’s current five-year plan (2017-2022), places a key emphasis on improving retention, six-year graduation rates, expanding faculty research options, improving infrastructure and customer service.\n\nThe plan, which is currently being updated, has resulted in several gains for the university.\n\nThis year, the university increased its overall points gained in achieving metrics set by the Board of Governors from 73 in 2020 to 79 in 2021, marking its highest increase in history. As a result, FAMU will see $12.65 million from the state investment along with $14 million from its own investment, for a total of $26.7 million in performance-based funding.\n\nFor the fall semester 2021, FAMU had 7,871 first-time-in-college students apply, up from 7,588 last fall. Of those, 2,293 were admitted.\n\nThe average GPA for admitted students increased to 3.8 compared to 3.74 in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. News & World Report’s guidebook includes reviews of 392 institutions, including 209 public, 179 private and four for-profits offering undergraduate majors as well as master’s and doctoral degrees.\n\nBest Colleges 2022:FSU ranked No. 19 in U.S. News & World Reports guidebook, UF claimed No. 5\n\nBest in the South:Stetson, ERAU land a spot in US News & World Report list\n\nThe institutions are ranked in categories such as graduation and retention rates, undergraduate academic reputation, faculty resources and social mobility, a key metric that has long been important to Robinson.\n\nFAMU moved up seven places to No. 13 in the U.S. News & World Report Social Mobility Index, a reflection of the six-year graduation rate of Pell grant eligible students, according to the release.\n\nFAMU ranks second among State University System institutions for social mobility behind Florida International University, which is ranked sixth.\n\nRobinson often refers to the Social Mobility Index as an important factor in defining the ability of HBCUs, and FAMU in particular, in growing the Black middle class.\n\n“I am especially excited by our rise in the Social Mobility Index ranking because it reflects our 133-year commitment to transforming the lives of students regardless of their socioeconomic status or whether they are among the first in their family to attend college or are from a long line of Rattlers,” Robinson said. “At FAMU, our faculty and staff recognize the promise in every student and understand society's need for the contributions of our graduates.”\n\nThe latest rankings come as Robinson and FAMU’s Board of Trustees focus on FAMU reaching the Top 100 among public universities nationally.\n\n“The rise in our rankings illustrates what we can do with a focused plan and improved investment, both of which are critical to our success. It is a statement about a joint effort between our Board and the President to establish and stick with key priorities,” FAMU Board of Trustees Chairman Kelvin Lawson said. “We want to continue to push the envelope and focus on ongoing improvement in our operating model as we continue our march to the top 100 colleges and universities in the nation.”\n\nFor more on the rankings, visit: https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges?src=usn_pr.\n\nContact senior writer Byron Dobson at bdobson@tallahassee.com or on Twitter @byrondobson.\n\nNever miss a story: Subscribe to the Tallahassee Democrat using the link at the top of the page.\n\nTop 10 HBCUs by U.S. News & World Report\n\nSpelman College, Atlanta, Georgia (1, Private)\n\nHoward University, Washington.

Ron DeSantis — to make good on state debts to land-grant HBCUs, alleging that Florida A&M University has been denied nearly $2 billion since 1987 by the state of Florida.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona along with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack sent letters to 16 state governors Monday, calling on them to equitably fund 16 land-grant HBCUs across the country due to the over $12 billion disparity in funding between the schools and their non-HBCU land-grant peers.\n\n“Unacceptable funding inequities have forced many of our nation’s distinguished Historically Black Colleges and Universities to operate with inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” Cardona said in a prepared statement.\n\nAttempts to get comment from the governor's office were unsuccessful.\n\nUnder what is called the Second Morrill Act of 1890, states that chose to open a second land-grant university to serve Black students are required to provide a fair distribution of state funds between their 1862 and 1890 land-grant universities.\n\nBut data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Survey (IPEDS) shows that unequitable appropriated funding of the land-grant HBCUs ranges from $172 million to $2.1 billion from 1987 to 2020.\n\nFAMU’s counterpart when it comes to land-grant institutions in the state is the University of Florida.\n\nBut $1.973 billion of state appropriated funding has been held back from FAMU in the last 33 years compared to the amount of money that UF has been receiving from the state.\n\nFAMU declined to comment on the issue while active unrelated litigation is pending on the same subject in the U.S. District Court.\n\nFAMU in the headlines:FAMU President Larry Robinson looks ahead after epic rise in latest U.S. News rankings\n\nOther land-grant HBCUs include North Carolina A&T State University with a $2.08 billion gap in state appropriations compared to North Carolina State University, Fort Valley State University with a $603.156 million gap compared to the University of Georgia and Alabama A&M University with a $527.28 million gap compared to Auburn University, according to NCES.\n\n“The documented discrepancies are a clarion call for governors to act without delay to provide significant support for the 1890 land-grant institutions in their respective states,” Vilsack said in a prepared statement. “Failing to do so will have severe and lasting consequences to the agriculture and food industry at a time when it must remain resilient and competitive.”\n\nWhile there are HBCU land-grant institutions in 18 states, the 16 letters were sent since Delaware and Ohio have equitably funded their respective universities, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture release.\n\nThe letters from the U.S. secretaries come during a time where advocates — including a group of FAMU students who took their concerns to court — have been pushing for states to increase HBCU funds.\n\nLast year, six FAMU students filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination by the state, which includes allegations about how the university faces underfunding when compared to other state institutions in Florida.\n\nIn a June court hearing, the late U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle rejected a motion to dismiss by Attorney General Ashley Moody and gave the students 30 days to amend their complaint to provide more data in support of their allegations.\n\nBut the state made a motion to dismiss the revised version, which has led the plaintiffs to respond with a new complaint that they hope will be back in front of a judge sometime toward the end of the year or in the beginning of next year to present their arguments, according to civil rights attorney Joshua Dubin — the lawyer representing the FAMU students.\n\nMore on FAMU related lawsuit:Judge issues ruling that indicates skepticism about key parts of FAMU student's lawsuit\n\n“I think it's a step in the right direction that light is being shined on this issue, but a request is just a request,” Dubin told the Tallahassee Democrat Thursday, referring to the letters sent to the governors. “We’re looking for something more than a request. We’re looking for a court order that mandates the state of Florida to equitably fund FAMU.”\n\n“The main reason behind filing the lawsuit in the first place is to get some equality here,” he added. “We’re going to keep pushing toward what our objective is, which is to right past wrongs and to ensure that it doesn’t continue so that a brighter future can be created for FAMU and its students.”\n\nAs the letters to the governors were released Monday, so were the U.S. News & World Report’s latest rankings, revealing that FAMU exceeded its goal of breaking into the Top 100 among the nation’s public universities at 91st place.\n\nFAMU also maintains its standing of being the top public HBCU in the nation for the fifth year in a row, according to the 2023-2024 U.S. News rankings.\n\nIn addition, the university is seeking $50.4 million in state funding in its legislative budget request, which is nearly twice the amount it requested last year.\n\nFAMU's rise in the rankings:'Outstanding': FAMU breaks into Top 100 in U.S. News & World Report rankings\n\n“I am continually inspired by all that HBCUs have achieved despite having to punch above their weight,” Cardona said in the release. “Our HBCUs graduate a huge share of our nation’s Black educators, doctors, engineers, judges and lawyers. These institutions and the talented, diverse students they serve must have equitable funding in order to reach their full potential and continue driving innovation.”\n\nThe Departments of Education and Agriculture have offered to work with each state’s budget office to examine the funding data and bring balance to investments in the underfunded HBCUs.\n\nContact Tarah Jean at tjean@tallahassee.com or follow her on twitter @tarahjean_.\n\nNever miss a story: Subscribe to the Tallahassee Democrat using the link at the top of the page.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/08/28/what-is-hbcu-black-college-university/10240301002/", "title": "What is an HBCU or historically Black college or university?", "text": "HBCUs or Historically Black Colleges or Universities were started during segregation to give Black students access to higher education.\n\nThe number of HBCUs in the U.S. have fluctuated due to financial and accreditation issues.\n\nExperts say despite schools now being integrated, HBCUs are still very much needed because of the visibility, culture and sense of pride they give Black students.\n\nSome Black students dream of going to them, following in the footsteps of sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers and trailblazers whose names have been etched into history.\n\nThey're HBCUs – historically Black colleges or universities – and there are more than 100 of them in the U.S., said Leslie Jones, founder and director of The Hundred-Seven, an organization that promotes the higher education institutions for Black students and was named after the number of HBCUs in the country at the time.\n\nJones, who went to Howard University in Washington, D.C., defines HBCUs the same way the Department of Education does, basing it on when the schools were founded.\n\n\"(That's) 1964 or earlier,\" she told USA TODAY. \"They were founded with the purpose of educating either a former slave or their descendants.\"\n\nEd Reed and the savior complex:HBCU football programs don't need shaming, they need coaches | Opinion\n\n'He actually let us down':Bethune-Cookman AD defends university after split with Ed Reed\n\nWhen were HBCUs first established, and why?\n\nThe earliest HBCUs were founded in Pennsylvania and Ohio, before the Civil War. One of them, the Institute for Colored Youth, opened in 1837 on a Philadelphia farm, Jones said. Today, it's called Cheyney University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAlso considered one of the first HBCUs is the Ashmun Institute, which was founded in Pennsylvania in 1854 and became Lincoln University in 1866, Jones said.\n\nMany HBCUs were founded as a response to segregation and slavery, she said.\n\nAt one point, there were hundreds of HBCUs, but some struggled to keep their doors open or merged with other schools, said Carlos Holmes, director of news services and university historian at Delaware State University.\n\nWhere are HBCUs located?\n\nHBCUs are mainly concentrated in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic. Some are as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nWhat are the top HBCUs?\n\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, the top three HBCUs are Spelman College, Howard University and Xavier University of Louisiana.\n\nU.S. News & World Report uses factors such as graduation and retention rates, social mobility and graduate indebtedness to score each HBCU.\n\nSpelman: In Atlanta, Spelman is the oldest historically Black college for women in America, according to the ranking site. The private college has 2,097 students.\n\nHoward: In Washington, D.C., Howard has an enrollment of more than 11,000 and is known for producing a great deal of the nation's Black doctors, dentists, pharmacists and engineers, according to the school's website.\n\nXavier University of Louisiana: In the heart of New Orleans, Xavier University of Louisiana has more than 3,300 students and has gained recognition as a top sciences and the liberal arts university. One of the university's claims to fame is the high number of students who complete medical school – 95.5% of Black Xavier graduates in 2013, according to the university.\n\nHere's the top 10 in its entirety:\n\nNo.1 - Spelman College\n\nNo. 2 - Howard University\n\nNo. 3 - Xavier University of Louisiana\n\nNo. 4 (tie) - Hampton University, Morehouse College and Tuskegee University\n\nNo. 7 - Florida A&M University\n\nNo. 8 - North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University\n\nNo. 9 - Fisk University\n\nNo. 10 (tie) - Claflin University and Delaware State University\n\nWhat are some affordable HBCUs students can consider, and what about lesser-known schools?\n\nJones said some HBCUs are quite inexpensiveif you look outside private schools, such as Howard and Morehouse. Even Howard's tuition compared with other Washington schools like Georgetown or American University tuition is cheaper, she said.\n\n\"Howard might, in your mind, be your dream college,\" Jones said. \"You get in, you might not be able to afford Howard. ... That doesn't mean you can't go to Dillard and be extremely successful. It doesn't mean you can't instead go to Alabama State and be able to afford it and still get an outstanding education.\"\n\nSome schools such as Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University cost about $5,000 a year depending on whether you're in or out of state, she said.\n\nAffordability is relative, though, and she encourages people to do more research.\n\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, some other less expensive schools include:\n\nMississippi Valley State University ($6,746+)\n\nAlcorn State University ($7,596+)\n\nSouthwestern Christian College ($8,132+)\n\nJackson State University ($8,445+)\n\nRust College ($9,900+)\n\nTexas College ($10,000+)\n\nAccording to Jones, other schools students may not be aware of include Clinton College in South Carolina and Coppin State University in Baltimore.\n\nFor many HBCUs, a struggle 'just to survive'\n\nJones said that of the HBCUs listed by the Department of Education, two are closed and two are unaccredited. Morris Brown College in Atlanta lost its accreditation 20 years ago but regained it this year, she said.\n\nDelaware State also gained accreditation in 1945 but lost it in 1949, Holmes said. The university faced a series of blows, including a lack of funding from the state, a closure causing some students to try to enroll at the University of Delaware, and a lawsuit filed by prospective students to admit them into the segregated school. Delaware State got its accreditation back in 1957, Holmes said.\n\nHe said it's incredible that HBCUs have survived all these years.\n\n\"I think that people ought to understand the struggles that many HBCUs have undergone just to survive, and notice some HBCUs just didn't,\" he said.\n\nAnd for those who want to support HBCUs, one of the best ways is financially, Jones said. HBCU alumni often enter service fields with lower salaries like social work, nursing and teaching, and HBCUs serve many lower-income students and first-generation college students who have to take out student loans and graduate with debt, she said.\n\nDo you have to be Black to go to an HBCU?\n\nNo.\n\n\"We've always welcomed anyone as long as the law allowed us to welcome anyone,\" said Jones, of The Hundred-Seven. \"The only reason our demographic started off the way that it did was because the laws required that it be so.\"\n\nIn fact, the first five students at Howard University were white women, she said.\n\nTheir fathers were trustees of the university, and white women weren't allowed to get an education anywhere else in Washington. Their fathers wanted them to get a college education, so they enrolled them at Howard, Jones said.\n\n\"The majority of students at Howard have long been African American,\" she told USA TODAY. \"But it was based on laws that white people created.\"\n\nWhat's the value of an HBCU education?\n\nJones said some people think that students who graduate from HBCUs aren't taken seriously, nor will they get a great education, and that HBCUs are \"a failure,\" but that's simply not true.\n\nHBCUs draw the attention of recruiters looking for diversity more than other schools, and they have \"unmatched\" history, culture and mentorship, she said.\n\n\"The idea of being on a campus where you know that 100 years ago there were people who were trailblazers walking across a campus that look like you is something that just you can't match,\" she said.\n\nThe curriculums, while not identical to non-HBCUs, usually offer programs students are interested in, especially undergraduate students, she said. And there's \"Black history woven across the curriculum,\" said Jones, who recalls taking Black philosophy at Howard University.\n\n'Man, it's cool':Phoenix Suns' Chris Paul graduates from HBCU Winston-Salem State\n\nAn innovative solution:An HBCU faced with surging enrollment in booming Nashville gets creative to house students\n\nAnd yes, HBCUs are still very much relevant, despite what some may think, said Holmes, of Delaware State University. HBCUs provide a welcoming environment for all students, especially African Americans.\n\n\"There's very much a place for HBCUs these days,\" he said. \"There's so much emphasis on historically Black colleges and universities because it is part of this country's history. It's part of this country's higher education history, and it should never be forgotten.\"\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

That’s among 230 public schools in statistics compiled by USA Today.\n\nLittle Delaware isn’t such a lightweight, apparently, when it comes to splurging on sports in a bid to become more relevant in its conference and even nationally. Delaware allocates a greater amount of university-derived money toward athletics than most schools.\n\nBlue Hens teams did begin to turn the corner in 2019-20, logging a 147-99-4 record before the coronavirus pandemic forced a premature end to winter and spring athletics in March.\n\nCLASSES TO RESUME: UD announces fall semester plans, changes\n\nThe $38.23 million in athletic funding that came directly from the institution in 2017-18, the most recent school year for which information is available, was considerably more than any of Delaware’s FCS counterparts, according to the Knight Commission.\n\nNext, were conference football rivals Rhode Island ($20.48 million) and Stony Brook ($17.22 million).\n\n“They stand out because there was an investment,” Rawak said of those financial figures. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with that, especially if we are producing.\"\n\nBut is that investment too significant?\n\nOnly one FBS athletic program received more in government/institutional support – the United States Air Force Academy ($39.8 million), according to the Knight Commission's 2017-18 data.\n\nThe subject came up last fall at a UD board of trustees’ committee on student life and athletics summit. Meeting minutes describe “a robust discussion” on the topic of spending “finite” resources on athletics and concerns about “the potential return” on the investment.\n\nIt was initiated by Matt Robinson, head of the UD sport management program who had been the interim athletic director in the first half of 2016 before Rawak’s hiring. Robinson had raised concerns about the university’s considerable subsidization of athletics with Rawak during the meeting.\n\nWhile acknowledging the discussion took place, Robinson, who is also UD Faculty Senate president, preferred not to comment further on the topic when recently asked by Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nAssanis had responded to Robinson’s concerns by expressing that he and other university presidents share the wish “to elevate their institutions through success in athletics,” meeting minutes reported.\n\nSurely, sports accomplishments are attention-getters that can fuel enrollment and fund-raising, though UD’s strong academic reputation and picturesque campus have long been powerful lures in their own right.\n\nRawak described athletics as “a window to the broader public” that could “drive the success of the entire university,” according to board of trustees meeting minutes.\n\nBut college athletics is also a costly venture.\n\nDivision I schools away from the Power Five bloc, which includes the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC and Pac-12 with their lucrative TV packages and wealthy donors, have a particularly difficult time finding outside funding sources.\n\nALL IN: CAA announces all teams will qualify for postseason tournaments\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has cast additional light on those high costs and athletic spending often viewed as frivolous, such as coaches’ salaries, staffing, scheduling and travel, especially from far-flung conference alignment. It has forced many to rethink their approaches and ensure spending is efficient and frugal.\n\nIn April, UD announced the pandemic had left it with a $65 million overall budget shortfall because of the switch to online learning after students were sent home and all university events were canceled in mid-March.\n\nAthletic financial losses were not severe but certainly impactful, Rawak suggested. The only cuts announced so far affecting athletics have been some part-time positions. Staff development, travel and scheduling are areas where budgets will be trimmed, Rawak said.\n\nThe basketball teams staying overnight at hotels before games at nearby Drexel and Towson and the football team sleeping in a hotel the night before home games are potential cost-cutting targets. This fall, the soccer, volleyball and field hockey teams are playing fewer games that involve significantly less travel.\n\n\"We're in a different time now,\" Rawak said of COVID-19's impact on college athletics and the need to adjust.\n\nA slew of Division I schools have recently dropped sports: Old Dominion (wrestling); Cincinnati (men’s soccer); Furman (baseball and men’s lacrosse); Central Michigan (men’s track and field); Akron (men’s cross country, men’s golf, women’s tennis); East Carolina (men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s swimming); Florida International (men’s indoor track); Appalachian State (men’s soccer, men’s indoor and outdoor track and men’s tennis); Wright State (men’s and women’s tennis and softball); Connecticut (men's cross country, swimming and tennis and women's rowing); and Brown (11 sports). Before those cuts, Brown's 38 teams were more than any school nationally except Harvard and Stanford.\n\nExcept for FCS-level Furman and Brown and non-football playing Wright State, all are FBS schools in Group of Five conferences. Commissioners from that collection of leagues, which do not reap the economic windfall of Power Five schools, recently requested a reduction in the NCAA requirement that they field a minimum of 16 teams. The NCAA Division I Council denied it.\n\nDelaware, which fields 21 athletic teams, had $44.32 million in athletic funding and expenses in the most recent 2017-18 fiscal review, according to the Knight Commission, including that $38.23 million in university backing. The $44.32 million was the figure that ranked 70th nationally in USA Today’s accounting.\n\nBy contrast, 34 football-playing schools from the FBS Mid-American Conference, Conference USA and Sun Belt Conference – all in that Group of Five – had lower operating expenses on athletics than Delaware, including sport-killers Central Michigan, Akron, FIU and Appalachian State.\n\nFBS schools may award 85 football scholarships compared with 63 for FCS schools such as Delaware, a significant additional expense.\n\nRawak, however, dismissed the Knight Commission math, claiming it gives a false impression that, she said, makes Delaware stand out more than it should in relation to its Division I peers.\n\nFor example, she said, sports medicine operates out of the Carpenter Center and is counted as part of the funding supporting athletics but is actually overseen by UD Student Health.\n\nShe also said some schools do not count the significant cost of athletic facility groundskeeping, as Delaware does, in figures given to the Knight Commission.\n\n“How everybody counts money is very different,” she said, including scholarships in those accounting variances. “It creates more questions.”\n\nThe Knight Commission, founded in 1989, is a panel of experts in education and athletics that aims to ensure college sports function within the academic framework of the institutions. The Collegiate Athletics Financial Information Database aims to improve the accountability of public Division I institutions by making their spending and earning more transparent.\n\nDREAM COMES TRUE: UD pitcher Sullivan signs with Phillies\n\n“I would guarantee you there are a lot of universities that are supported the way we are but they don’t count it so it’s not an accurate interpretation,” Rawak said, adding that includes fellow Colonial Athletic Association members.\n\nIn an email response to questions, Amy Perko, the Knight Commission’s chief executive officer, wrote that “the NCAA has made changes over the years to improve definitions and comparability but there may continue to be differences in how institutions report the data.\"\n\n\"That said,\" she added, \"these audited reports represent the most accurate athletics financial reports available and the data are used by the NCAA to produce ‘dashboard metrics’ that institutional leaders use to assess their athletic programs’ financial health. These institutional data are rarely seen by the public.”\n\nThe Knight Commission employs financial data that schools are required to submit to the NCAA that is “subject to agreed-upon procedures performed by a qualified independent accountant,” according to the commission, and approved by university presidents or chancellors.\n\nPerko added that “the Knight Commission has always believed that – at their best – intercollegiate sports provide important educational opportunities for college athletes and benefits for the entire university community. We also believe that more effective disclosure of finances – and of financial priorities – will enhance the long-term prospects of college sports by ensuring they remain part of, not apart from, the core mission of universities.’’\n\nMajor increase in athletic spending\n\nWhatever differences there may be between how schools do their accounting, there is no doubt Delaware has seen a huge increase in athletic expenditures and university support since Assanis and Rawak appeared in the spring of 2016.\n\nFor the 2015-16 school year, the last before they arrived, Delaware had $34.31 million in athletics funding, with $28.05 million, or 82%, coming from UD coffers.\n\nIn just two years, Delaware’s annual spending on athletics increased $10 million, all provided by the university.\n\n“I was looking for the best person to take the athletics program here to the next level,” Assanis said when Rawak was hired. “ ... The first thing we need to be is the best within the [Colonial Athletic Association].”\n\nRawak, who came to Delaware from the University of Michigan, was determined to build a stronger foundation upon which championship seasons could be constructed. Assanis provided the financial resources, with the board of trustees’ support.\n\n“If you were to look at each of the different programs and how they’ve achieved, my answer would be ‘Yes,’” Rawak said when asked if Delaware was making good on that investment. “They’re all in different places.”\n\nBLUE HENS BACK: First group returns to use athletic facilities\n\nIn that board of trustees' committee on student life and athletics meeting, Rawak described her intentions to make Delaware a “Cinderella story” in college athletics, suggesting the Blue Hens had to rise from wretched depths to reach championship heights. It’s why her strategic plan for athletics is titled “Project Glass Slipper.”\n\nIn actuality, Delaware seems miscast for that role.\n\nThe Blue Hens have hardly been viewed by collegiate counterparts as forlorn or deserving pity despite the ups and downs of their teams, making the rags-to-riches fairy-tale comparison suspect. Delaware has often been held in high regard by sporting peers, though many would agree that its teams could fare better overall in the conference.\n\nIn the few years before Rawak came, UD women’s basketball teams, thanks to Elena Delle Donne’s presence, went to the 2012 and 2013 NCAA tournaments. Their male counterparts followed in 2014.\n\nMen’s soccer, having not reached NCAA play since 1970, made the 2011 and 2013 NCAA brackets. Field hockey began its run of CAA titles and NCAA berths in 2013. Women’s track won the 2014 CAA title.\n\nBefore that, the football team reached national title games in 2003, 2007 and 2010, winning the first. Men’s lacrosse was in four NCAA tournaments from 2005-11, including a Final Four appearance in 2007; and volleyball made four NCAA trips from 2007-11.\n\nBut to enhance its championship chances, Delaware has spent more.\n\n\"It's allowing us to do something really special here for what I believe is a really special place and has the ability to achieve,\" Rawak said.\n\nOLYMPIC STAND RESONATES: Smith's, Carlos' 1968 protest still goes unheeded\n\nJMU, which has five fewer teams and 100 fewer athletes than Delaware, had $51.72 million in funding for 2017-18 with $41.7 million from institutional/government sources, most from mandatory fees imposed on students.\n\nThe USA Today data reveals FBS members Air Force Academy ($40.2 million) and Connecticut ($39 million) as the only others allocating more university-derived funds for athletics than Delaware.\n\nDelaware receives 86.25% of its athletic funding from the university, ranking it ninth among the 230 Division I schools in the USA Today compilation. Among the eight ahead of Delaware was CAA rival Towson (87.17%).\n\nThough it comes under the heading of “institutional/government support,” UD officials insist the university, not state taxpayers, provides the economic sustenance for Blue Hens sports. The Senate Joint Finance Committee approved $125 million in 2020-21 annual funding for UD on June 5.\n\nState Rep. John Kowalko, whose 25th district includes UD's campus, doubts the contention that taxpayer dollars are not being used to support athletics.\n\n“I’m saying, ‘Prove it,’” Kowalko said. “That money could be intermingled dramatically. … Until they agree they are willing to support the repeal of their FOIA, so I can look at these numbers, I don’t believe them.”\n\nKowalko was referring to the University of Delaware being exempt from state records laws, including most Freedom of Information Act requests. That means the university does not need to provide the public with details of its accounting.\n\n“I believe that they are co-mingling taxpayer money,” Kowalko added, suggesting some operational dollars from the state likely do support athletics. “It’s the same pot of soup.”\n\nIn response to a FOIA request submitted by The News Journal seeking more data on athletic funding, UD's associate vice president and deputy general counsel, Jennifer M. Becnel-Guzzo, wrote the “athletic department is not supported with public funds. Therefore, the university has no public records responsive to your request.”\n\nWhile one UD athletic official did compare Delaware’s institutional funding to those required student fees charged at JMU and many other schools, such as UConn, Rawak said that is not correct.\n\nShe said athletic funding comes from general university resources that are drawn from various reserves but that students and their families are “not paying for athletics.”\n\nDelaware also spent $11.77 million on athletic aid for its 600-plus student-athletes in 2017-18, according to the Knight Report. That’s roughly $20,000 per student-athlete.\n\nNEW APPROACH: COVID forces recruiting changes for Rocco\n\nUD’s $1.4 billion endowment does not pay for athletics and is presently not a viable source, Rawak said. But endowing components of athletics as a funding mechanism is a goal, she added.\n\nTuition and fees have typically risen about 4% annually for UD students, increasing $600 to $14,280 for in-state undergraduates in 2019-20 and $1,400 to $35,710 for their out-of-state counterparts.\n\n\"We don't use that to fund athletics,\" Rawak said, adding that the university has numerous income sources beyond student payments.\n\nSeveral UD faculty members not authorized to speak on behalf of the university or the athletic department, as well as those with knowledge of the subject outside the school, disputed Rawak's contention students are not helping to foot the bill for athletics, however.\n\nDavid Ridpath, an Ohio University sports management professor, agrees that “athletic programs at colleges and universities have value.” He is president of the board of directors for the Drake Group, which has a mission “to defend academic integrity in higher education from the corrosive aspects of commercialized college sports.”\n\n“But that value is often overstated and used as an excuse to spend more,” he told The News Journal, “such as when apologists claim that athletic success influences enrollment, donations, etc. when the evidence on that is mixed at best.\n\n“So it becomes a perpetual cycle of trying to be something you are not, and chasing someone else who is likely spending money they don’t have. A school can have a successful athletic program without continuing to spend more and more where likely the end game is exactly the same as when they started.”\n\nChanging to spur success\n\nPart of Rawak’s efforts to improve UD athletic fortunes has included changing head coaches in 12 of Delaware’s 21 varsity sports.\n\nThe seven conference titles Delaware has won since Rawak came – three in field hockey (2016, 2017 and 2019) and one each in men’s soccer (2016), baseball (2017), women’s golf (2017) and women’s outdoor track and field (2019) – were all by teams with head coaches who were here before Rawak’s arrival.\n\nIn 2016, Delaware also won the NCAA field hockey title.\n\n“If you were to look at the successes of our programs, collectively, all of them, one of the things to recognize is, Rome wasn’t built in a day,” said Rawak, who is frequently lauded by staff for her positive approach and leadership. “It takes time.\"\n\nThe 2019-20 school year was, by far, Delaware’s most successful recently from a won-loss standpoint before the shutdown.\n\nThe previous three, Blue Hen squads went 189-188-2 in 2016-17, 170-184-6 in 2017-18 and 162-200-3 last year. Along with that CAA women’s track title, the 2018-19 season did feature the return to the national rankings by the men’s lacrosse team.\n\nThe 147-99-4 record in 2019-20 was a dramatic improvement and likely reflected some new coaches reaping the benefits of their programs getting re-established.\n\nIn addition to more field hockey success, this school year featured a 22-11 record in men’s basketball, its best in six seasons; women’s soccer had its highest finish, second place, in 18 Colonial Athletic Association seasons and most wins (12) since 1994; women’s cross-country was a best-ever second in the CAA meet; men’s tennis was 14-1 with a chance at the winningest season in school history when it ended prematurely; softball was 19-4, equaling its best start ever, at the time spring sports were halted.\n\nOther sports, however, such as football – long the university’s pride and joy – and women’s basketball, struggled to regain past glories.\n\nLEARNING FROM LEGENDS: QBs enjoy video meetings with Blue Hen greats\n\nAfter ending a seven-year NCAA football playoff absence in 2018, Delaware went 5-7 last fall, its third under coach Danny Rocco. Despite a veteran lineup, women’s basketball was 12-17 under third-year coach Natasha Adair.\n\nAmong recent athletic upgrades at Delaware have been devoting more resources toward sports such as swimming, tennis, golf, cross-country and track, which were once designated as “low-tier.” Tennis players often supplied their own rackets, and runners received just one pair of shoes for a season.\n\nMuch of Rawak’s approach has gone toward adding staff positions aimed at supporting the athletic mission, such as in heath-, media-, academic- and leadership-related positions.\n\nIn 2015-16, Delaware spent $3.65 million on support and administrative compensation, according to the Knight Commission. Two years later, that figure had nearly doubled to $6.8 million.\n\nThe UD staff directory on BlueHens.com recently listed 219 positions, including 14 involved with recreation programs and intramural activities at Carpenter Sports Building on central campus.\n\nIn contrast, several FBS schools that are close to Delaware in terms of spending list far fewer, such as Conference USA’s Old Dominion (166), Mountain West member Wyoming (186) and the MAC’s Buffalo (193).\n\nThe University of Delaware does not reveal salaries of its coaches or athletic administrators, even though some are among the First State’s highest-paid employees.\n\nIn doing so, UD cites its status as a state-assisted yet privately chartered and governed institution. Taxpayer dollars do typically account for roughly 10% of the university’s annual operating budget.\n\nThe university's IRS Form 990, which is made public, does list the highest compensated employees.\n\nIt is known that Rocco was the third-highest paid UD employee in 2017, according to the most recently available IRS Form 990, with total compensation of $609,167. Rawak ranked seventh at $480,046.\n\nBoth have taken 5% pay cuts, along with Adair and men’s basketball coach Martin Ingelsby, as part of COVID-19 money-saving measures.\n\nRidpath, the Ohio University professor, termed Delaware’s institutional and government support “a significant amount of money that could have been used for other things to support the educational mission, but Delaware made a choice.”\n\nBut was it the right choice?\n\n“For Delaware, that is pretty high of an amount,” Ridpath said. “There are many disadvantages, not the least of which is aptly explained as robbing Peter to pay Paul. I don’t think some funding like this is inherently bad but this amount is too much considering where the money is coming from.\n\n“... The real danger is schools like Delaware that don’t generate enough revenue [income] still increasing spending. The question is why and how that impacts university?”\n\nNew financial sources surface\n\nThe huge financial impact athletics has on a college is not new.\n\nIn his 1918 tome “The Higher Learning in America,” economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote: “College sports come in for ever increasing attention and take an increasingly prominent and voluminous place in the university’s life.”\n\nHe warned collegiate athletics was “earnestly pushed by the businesslike authorities” even though, he added, “it is the most widely out of touch with all learning.”\n\nThese are modern-day arguments as well, though UD athletes tend to perform better academically than their counterparts. Ten teams had perfect scores in 2018-19 in the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, which measures academic eligibility and retention of scholarship athletes over a four-year period.\n\nIn the introduction to his 2019 book, Intercollegiate Athletics Inc., George Mason University economics and public policy professor James T. Bennett wrote that collegiate athletic programs have become “gargantuan, taxpayer-supported spectacles that now dominate many public universities.”\n\nOf Delaware pulling so much of its athletic revenue from institutional sources, Bennett said, “That’s not revenue at all. Revenues come from ticket sales and paraphernalia sales. This isn’t revenue.”\n\nIt’s actually a subsidy that’s granted, in this case, by the university.\n\n“The whole thing is a scam, very candidly,” Bennett said. “I mean, what’s the purpose of the university? I thought it was education.”\n\n“Highest-paid guy is some loser coach,” added Bennett, who was speaking generally not specifically about anyone at Delaware. “What does it say about priorities? Spending tens of million dollars on programs with zero academic value. This is unheard of throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Think of how you could divert that money.”\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION: Howard starter Prince transfers to Delaware\n\nDelaware has shown the potential to tap into other monetary resources, however.\n\nOne of Delaware’s biggest victories off the field in recent years, for all to see, did come in fundraising, though there was a substantial cost to the university as well.\n\nIn a campaign separate from normal athletic support involving capital funds, UD contributed $25 million toward the $60 million project to refurbish the west grandstand of Delaware Stadium and build the adjoining Whitney Athletic Center.\n\nThe other $35 million was raised through private donations, including a $10 million gift from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth. The nearly two-year project is slated to be concluded late this summer.\n\nThe easy transmission of the coronavirus between people, which has led to social-distancing standards, jeopardizes the immediate future of crowded assemblies and the financial rewards that come with them, however. Delaware has not yet announced how it will handle or limit football crowds this season.\n\nUD has other facility improvements it would like to tackle, including updating the east stands at Delaware Stadium and a complete modernization of the window-less Delaware Field House. The Delaware Stadium/Whitney Athletic Center project demonstrated there are potential outside financial resources for athletics.\n\n“The fundraising we did here,” Rawak said during a tour of Delaware Stadium, “was a significantly positive sign that people believe in the vision and are invested in it.\"\n\nOfficials also visualize Delaware Stadium as a greater potential revenue generator by using it as a site for large-scale events, much the way the Carpenter Center is a setting for concerts, graduations and other gatherings beyond UD games. Placing a temporary public ice-skating rink inside Delaware Stadium in the winter, for instance, and even playing hockey games there has been proposed.\n\nThe athletic department received just $710,000 from donor contributions in 2017-18, below the FCS median, according to the Knight Commission (Donations for the Delaware Stadium/Whitney Center project count separately because they're for a capital project not athletic expenses).\n\nWith the exception of several Historically Black Colleges and Universities, most FCS schools had a larger percentage of their revenue from those sources than Delaware.\n\nIn marked contrast, perennial FCS football champ North Dakota State pulled in $6.7 million in donor contributions; CAA rival William & Mary, $5.8 million; Missouri State, $4.7 million; football power Montana State, $4.2 million; and JMU, $2.5 million.\n\nWith schools having to rein in athletic costs because of COVID-19’s impact, Delaware faces a stiff challenge in its continued effort to improve its sports fortunes while also being fiscally fit and tuned in to important social issues.\n\n“I don’t resent that fact that they are trying to make major sports programs prominent for this university,” Kowalko said, “but is it at the cost of academics? Is it at the cost of integrating the school when they talk about diversity?”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

The officer with the Hoover Police Department is expected to survive. Hoover is just south of Birmingham. Hoover police Lt. Daniel Lowe said a driver reported that someone fired multiple shots at his vehicle on Interstate 459 Sunday morning. No one was injured. Officers had information about the vehicle used in the shooting and located a possible suspect at an apartment complex in Hoover. As they attempted to make contact with the person, he produced a weapon and opened fire, Lowe said in a news release. One officer was struck multiple times, but his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Hoover police returned fire, though it wasn’t clear whether the suspect was hit, Lowe said. Police evacuated some apartments and advised other residents to stay inside on the belief that the suspect was still at the complex. The department announced later on its Twitter page that the suspect was in custody.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Elders and Youth Conference is underway in Anchorage this week, KNBA-Anchorage reports. For the last two years, the pandemic kept them from meeting in person. On Sunday, the First Alaskans Institute held a “Warming of the Hands” reception at the Alaska Native Heritage Center to celebrate the start of the conference. The head of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium thanked the institute for requiring masks and proof of vaccination, according to the news outlet. The conference, now in its 39th year, is a way for both young and old to make a personal connection through their love of Alaska Native culture.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A $1,150 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest in the killing of a radio collared bobcat that was part of a Tucson research project, according to authorities. The Arizona Game and Fish Department said the bobcat was found fatally shot on Sept. 28. Officials said the research project, which is partially funded by a state Game and Fish grant, is studying how bobcats use the wildlife-urban interface on the west side of Tucson. Department officials said the maximum penalty for illegally killing wildlife is four months in jail and a $750 fine and civil penalties could also apply. The Arizona Game and Fish Department manages managing more than 800 native wildlife species.\n\nArkansas\n\nDecatur: A 71-year-old man was fatally shot by a northwest Arkansas sheriff’s deputy who found him driving a tractor and displaying a handgun, authorities said. Nelson Amos was fatally shot Saturday by a Benton County sheriff’s deputy, according to Arkansas State Police. State police said Sunday that they were investigating the shooting. State police said that sheriff’s deputies had been called after someone reported hearing gunfire on Amos’ property. State police said that when a deputy later encountered Amos driving a tractor on a local road and brandishing a handgun, the deputy fired his rife, killing Amos. State police said their investigation will be submitted to the Benton County prosecutor, who will determine whether the use of deadly force by the sheriff’s deputy was consistent with the law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWhittier: A person suspected of being under the influence while riding a horse through city streets was arrested after leading police on a pursuit in Southern California, authorities said. Officers in a patrol car chased the suspect Saturday in Whittier, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, according to police. “An intoxicated person on a horse, galloping through traffic… refusing to pull the horse over… that was our afternoon,” Whittier police posted on Instagram. The pursuit ended with the DUI suspect in custody and the horse receiving lots of love from officers, police said. Accompanying photos showed officers leading the brown horse with a saddle on its back from the scene and offering it water.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: The city of Pueblo and Pueblo School District 60 are seeking to improve safety and accessibility to a pair of East Side schools through a grant application to the Colorado Department of Transportation. The Pueblo D60 board directors voted unanimously Thursday to apply for a Safe Routes to School grant to add sidewalks, Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramps, bike lanes and road markings at various places along Monument Avenue where Park View Elementary and the Risley International Academy of Innovation are located. The total project area spans from East Second Street to East 12th Street along Monument Avenue. During a Pueblo D60 board work session Thursday, Pueblo Area Council of Governments (PACOG) Transportation Director Eva Cosyleon explained the need for creating a “pedestrian and bicycle safe corridor” in the project area. “We have broken sidewalks, we have missing sidewalks at driveways and alleys, and also missing ADA curb ramps – which poses a huge issue for people with a handicap,” Cosyleon said. “They need to have accessibility for wheelchairs or even mothers who have strollers and are trying to take their kids to school.” Cosyleon also presented traffic-crash data from the past five years to board directors. From 2017 to 2022, there have been 280 accidents within a two-mile radius of the Monument Avenue corridor and two people have been killed. Among those crashes, seven involved pedestrians, two involved school-aged children, two involved bicyclists and one involved an individual in a wheelchair.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMorris: A 250-pound black bear mauled a 10-year-old boy playing in his grandparents’ backyard in Connecticut and tried to drag him away before the animal was fatally shot by police, authorities said. The child was attacked about 11 a.m. Sunday in the town of Morris, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries that were not life-threatening. Officers from the state police and DEEP’s environmental conservation force responded and shot the bear, authorities said. The boy’s grandfather described the harrowing attack to the Republican-American of Waterbury. James Butler said his grandson was playing near a trampoline when the bear emerged from thick woods behind the house. “I heard him yell ‘bear’ and when I looked up, I saw his leg in the bear’s mouth and the bear trying to drag him across the lawn,” Butler said. Butler, who uses a wheelchair, wheeled his chair toward the bear and threw a metal bar at its head, he told the newspaper. The bear released the boy but then grabbed the child a second time and used its claws to try to roll the boy onto his back, the grandfather said. A neighbor alerted by the boy’s screams raced over and scared the bear off by brandishing a pipe and yelling, Butler said. The bear was fatally shot by police a short time later. Butler, and his wife, Christina Anderson, who was inside the house when the bear attacked, said the boy suffered a puncture wound to one thigh, bite marks on a foot and ankle and claw marks on his back. State biologist Jenny Dixon said the risk of negative bear-human interactions is increasing as the state’s expanding bear population becomes acclimated to humans and develops a taste for their food.\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: One person is dead and two others were seriously injured in a crash involving two trucks early Saturday morning in Middletown, according to Delaware State Police. State police said at approximately 4:23 a.m., a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 driven by an unidentified 24-year-old was traveling south on Route 13/South Dupont Highway. At about the same time, a 2018 Ford F-150 had entered the left lane of Route 13 from Hyetts Corner Road headed north. A police investigation determined that, at some point north of the Route 1 overpass, for an unknown reason, the Dodge left the southbound lanes, crossed the grass median and entered the northbound left lane of Route 13, where it collided with the Ford. Police found that neither the 24-year-old driver of the Dodge nor a 26-year-old front-seat passenger were wearing their seat belts. They were both seriously injured and taken to an area hospital. The 67-year-old driver of the Ford, who was wearing his seat belt, was pronounced deceased at the scene of the collision, police said Sunday. His identity was being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Route 13 was closed for almost four hours while the crash was investigated and the roadway was cleared.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man was reunited with his 5-month-old puppy after police say he was robbed and shot at last Wednesday in Northeast D.C., WUSA-TV reports. “Thank you to everyone who submitted tips to help find this furry friend,” D.C. police tweeted out Monday. D.C. police worked with the Humane Rescue Alliance and received community tips to safely locate the puppy that had been missing since Oct. 12 when the dog’s owner was allegedly robbed at gunpoint in the 4500 block of Polk Street, Northeast D.C. According to the police report, the robber got away with the dog and shot at the owner as he ran away. The dog owner was not injured. The case is still being investigated, according to the news outlet.\n\nFlorida\n\nFernandina Beach: Two men face attempted murder charges for allegedly firing into each other’s vehicles on a busy highway and wounding each other’s daughters, who were passengers in their back seats. William Hale, of Douglasville, Georgia, and Frank Allison, of Callahan, Florida, were charged last week with attempted second-degree murder in the Oct. 8 confrontation on U.S. Highway 1 in Nassau County. A witness told Nassau County sheriff’s deputies that both vehicles were being driven so erratically and engaging in a “cat and mouse” chase that he called the authorities out of concern, according to an incident report. Hale, driving a truck with relatives as passengers, told deputies that he and Allison were “brake checking,” or braking in front of each other repeatedly, during the confrontation. He said at some point, he heard a “pow” at his back door, so he grabbed a gun he kept in his center console and fired out of the driver’s window, according to the incident report. “It was an instant reaction,” Hale said, noting that he fired “everything that was in the clip,” deputies reported. Allison told deputies that he fired his gun at the truck’s bed or tire after a water bottle was thrown into his car. Before the water bottle was thrown, his wife had been “flicking them off,” he said. “Mr. Allison said his goal of firing the shot was to ‘get out of the whole situation,’ ” the deputies reported. Hale’s daughter suffered a wound to her upper calf, while Allison’s daughter suffered a collapsed lung, according to the report. There was no attorney listed for Hale in an online docket. An attorney for Allison didn’t immediately respond to an emailed inquiry on Monday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Four people were hurt, including three students, in a shooting during Clark Atlanta University’s homecoming outside a campus library early Sunday, authorities said. A large group of people were listening to a DJ near Atlanta University Center’s Robert W. Woodruff Library around 12:30 a.m. when officers on patrol in the area heard gunshots, Atlanta police said. A preliminary investigation found three students and another person were injured when shots were fired from a vehicle, Clark Atlanta University said. Atlanta police said multiple people were shot. One of the victims was grazed and refused medical attention. Three others were taken to a hospital, though they were conscious and alert. Clark Atlanta is part of Atlanta University Center’s consortium of historically Black colleges.\n\nHawaii\n\nMaui: Maui County’s race for mayor is turning into the most contentious in the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. In Saturday’s debate, organized by Akaku Maui Community Media, incumbent Mayor Mike Victorino defended his record, and retired judge Richard Bissen accused Victorino of being a passive mayor. The candidates had similar views on land swapping for properties facing erosion, homelessness, supporting reservations and fees to manage over-tourism, according to the news outlet. The general election will be held on Nov. 8.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Department of Agriculture announced that it plans to crack down on the sale of pet CBD, the Idaho Statesman reports. The department began having new conversations about pet CBD when the Legislature passed a law legalizing industrial help. The agency sent out a letter in July warning sellers that enforcement would begin Nov. 1, according to the news outlet. Supporters of pet CBD say it eases their animals’ anxiety and pain.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The second and final Illinois gubernatorial debate is set for Tuesday, potentially the last time that Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker and Republican challenger Darren Bailey will share a televised stage at the same time. Recent polls indicate Pritzker has a sizable lead over Bailey, a Xenia state senator, with a possibility to win in November by similar margins to his 2018 victory over former Gov. Bruce Rauner. Public Policy Polling conducted a poll on the behalf of the Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ, which found the Democrat with a 49% to 34% lead over his opponent. In 2018, Pritzker received 54.5% of the vote compared to 38.8% going to Rauner, the Republican incumbent. With election day now a little more than three weeks away, University of Illinois-Springfield political science professor emeritus Kent Redfield says the upcoming debate provides both candidates with an opportunity to gain, maintain or lose support.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Firefighters were battling a large fire Monday in southwestern Indiana that’s left an Evansville warehouse and neighboring buildings in ruins and produced a smoke plume visible for miles around. Evansville Fire Department spokesman Mike Larson said about “every truck in the city” as well as one fire unit from Henderson, Kentucky, was called to the scene of the warehouse fire along Morton Avenue. He said the fire was contained as of 9:15 a.m. CDT and no longer a threat to spread, but fires were still burning inside the warehouse and neighboring buildings. Dozens of firefighters would likely remain at the scene for hours, Larson told the Evansville Courier & Press. Larson said there were no reported injuries, and there was no word yet on a possible cause of the fire in the city about 170 miles southwest of Indianapolis. The fire, which was reported about 4:40 a.m., produced a smoke plume so thick it was clearly visible on weather radar in the city. Video footage of the scene showed that flames were still rising by mid-morning from multiple collapsed buildings across a large area and producing smoke plumes. Authorities closed the Lloyd Expressway near the Evansville’s Division Street and U.S. 41 exits and asked motorists to avoid the area.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, of Iowa, has been hospitalized with a kidney infection, her office said Monday. Hinson’s chief of staff, Jimmy Peacock, issued a statement saying Hinson was admitted Sunday night to a hospital in Cedar Rapids. “She is looking forward to being back on the road soon,” Peacock said. Hinson’s congressional office confirmed that Hinson, a Republican, remained hospitalized Monday morning. The office did not respond to a question about when she was expected to be released. Hinson is running for reelection to Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District seat and is being challenged by Democrat Liz Mathis, state senator.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas will begin winding down a COVID-19-era rental assistance program, a move that was expected but still has housing advocates worried about whether renters and the nonprofits that help support them will be prepared. The Kansas Emergency Rental Assistance program was created in March 2021 as the latest iteration in a series of efforts to provide aid to renters affected by the adverse economic conditions created by the pandemic. Backed by $200 million in federal funds and run by the Kansas Housing Resources Corporation, the program’s launch was rocky at first due to limited staffing and high demand, though things eventually stabilized. State officials announced Wednesday the program was entering a “hold phase,” where the agency has received enough applications to exhaust its funding. All current applications under review will be put on pause unless more money becomes available. “We may not have the funds to ultimately be able to review or fund those applications,” Ryan Vincent, executive director of the KHRC, told KMUW. “We’ll have them ready, and if we end up receiving any additional funding … we can go back and fund some of those applications in the second hold phase.” The prospect of obtaining additional federal funds is uncertain. Congress could ultimately choose to appropriate more funds for the program, though such a move seems unlikely. The U.S. Treasury Department has also reallocated money from states that have been slower to spend their funds or declined to participate in the program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A county’s court operations that have been closed since historic flooding in July will resume this month. The Knott County Office of Circuit Court Clerk will reopen Oct. 31 in the county Judicial Center. Circuit and district court proceedings will be conducted remotely due to ongoing repairs to the center. Proceedings may be heard in person in another county if all parties agree, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts in Frankfort. The Supreme Court issued an administrative order amending the emergency order that suspended court operations after the flooding. The order clarifies that the clerk’s office was legally closed from July 28 to Oct. 30 for time computation purposes and allows the presiding judge to grant additional time extensions. Gov. Andy Beshear said last week that 43 people from six counties died in the flooding that hit parts of eastern Kentucky in late July. He said one person remains missing.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Republican Tim Temple, a wealthy insurance executive from Baton Rouge, will run against incumbent GOP Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon in 2023 with the state mired in a homeowners insurance crisis. Temple posed a strong challenge to Donelon in 2019 by spending $2 million of his own money, but Donelon pulled out another win with 53% of the statewide vote. Donelon first won the office in 2006. “Over the last 17 years, Louisiana auto rates have soared to the most expensive in the country, while recently we’ve seen an explosion of homeowner rate increases and an expansion of attorneys promising quick claim settlements and loosely regulated public adjusters,” Temple said in a news release. “Just last week, the current commissioner approved a 63% homeowner’s insurance rate increase,” Temple said. “Continuing to recycle old plans ignores the actual problems and shortcomings altogether, and these issues are too serious to ignore. More than ever Louisiana needs an insurance commissioner with experience in the insurance industry, that will be honest, transparent, accountable, and put the people of this state ahead of insurance companies.” While it’s true Donelon approved a 63% rate hike for customers in the state’s quasi-government safety net insurance company Citizens, he had little choice. By law, Citizens’ prices must be 10% above the highest market rate in each parish or the actuarial rate, whichever is higher. Citizens provides insurance to homeowners who can’t secure protection in the private market.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Town leaders have taken steps to ensure a diverse range of reading materials stay on shelves of the historic Rice Public Library as book-banning efforts have surged nationally. A formal “Freedom to Read” policy was adopted by the Town Council at its Oct. 12 meeting. “The freedom to read is essential to our democracy,” the policy states in part. “The Town of Kittery is devoted to reading and wishes to assert the public interest in the preservation of the freedom to read,” it reads. “We trust our Kittery residents to recognize propaganda and misinformation and to make their own decisions about what they read and believe. The freedom to read is guaranteed by the Constitution.” Approved by the Town Council in tandem with the policy was a step-by-step book challenge process, which outlines how Kittery’s Library Advisory Committee receives and evaluates contested reading materials. Only Kittery residents are permitted to initiate a challenge. “The library considers material objectionable only if the material taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value,” the challenged materials policy reads. Lee Perkins, the town library director since 2010, noted Rice Public Library previously followed the American Library Association’s “Freedom to Read” statement. Because the library officially became a town department in 2019, however, the Town Council had to approve the town’s own “Freedom to Read” library policy “to carry forward this commitment,” according to a report to the council from Town Manager Kendra Amaral.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration has launched a survey to receive public input on preliminary improvement concepts and highway needs for the expansion of Route 90 (Ocean City Expressway). The survey, which was announced in an Oct. 12 news release, is available to the public through 11:59 p.m. Nov. 10. Results will be used to form preliminary improvement concepts. The survey is part of the MD 90 Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) Study. Expansion of the entire 12-mile corridor between Coastal Highway and Route 50 is a part of the state’s long-term “Reach the Beach” plan. Improvements include general road safety, traffic congestion relief, and allowing first responders such as police, firefighters and EMTs to respond to emergencies swiftly. As stated by the Maryland Department of Transportation’s State Highway Administration, the western end of Route 90 at Route 50 carries roughly 33,000 vehicles per day throughout the summer season. By 2045, the highway’s average daily traffic volume is expected to increase by 10%.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSwampscott: Police came to the rescue of a person who was out walking their dog over the weekend when they were surrounded by a pack of coyotes. Police in Swampscott received a call at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday from the dog walker who said they were surrounded and the coyotes were “not backing down,” police said in a Facebook post. Responding officers counted at least nine coyotes. They were apparently scared off by the arrival of the cruisers with their lights flashing. Police escorted the dog walker and their pet to their home with no additional danger. The dog walker’s name was not made public. Police also posted a series of tips from the Humane Society for how to deal with bold coyotes, urging residents to be aware of their surroundings when walking their dogs, especially during evening hours when coyotes are most active. Police also recommended that people bring noisemakers, squirt guns or pepper spray with them to scare coyotes away.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan students, and particularly those experiencing homelessness, continue to attend school at a lower rate than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. The statewide school attendance rate for the 2021-22 school year fell to 88%, down 4.1 percentage points from the previous school year, when attendance hovered at 92.9%. The decline marked a 4.3-percentage-point drop from 2019-20’s attendance rate of 93.1%, according to state data released in September. It is the first time in at least five years that the statewide attendance rate has dipped below 90%. Economically disadvantaged students attended school at a rate of 88% last school year, down from 90.7% in 2020-21. Students experiencing homelessness attended school at a rate of 79.8% in 2021-22, a decline of 5.4 percentage points from the prior year’s rate of 85.2%. State attendance rates are calculated by dividing the total days students could attend school by the total days students actually attend. “There has to be a recommitment to intentionally addressing chronic absenteeism here in this great state of Michigan,” said Delsa Chapman, deputy superintendent at the Michigan Department of Education.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mayor Dave Kleis announced Friday the city was awarded $1.09million in state grant funds for the installation of green hydrogen and renewable natural gas demonstration projects. Funding came from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources. These technologies will reduce operating costs, keep user rates low, provide additional revenue opportunities, provide economic growth opportunities for the community, reduce dependence on natural gas and high carbon fuel sources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase energy resiliency, according to a press release from the city.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A pickup truck struck two University of Mississippi students in a parking lot in downtown Oxford, killing one of them and injuring the other, police said. Two suspects, both from Collierville, Tennessee, were arrested by Monday in the crash, which occurred early Sunday, authorities said. Tristan Holland was taken into custody Sunday in Shelby County, Tennessee, on accessory after the fact. He will face extradition to Oxford, according to the Oxford Police Department. Seth Rokitka was taken into custody Monday after investigators found his wrecked truck in Marshall County, Mississippi, between Oxford and Collierville. The Oxford Police Department said it would provide more information after Rokitka is charged. It was not immediately clear whether either Holland or Rokitka had an attorney who could comment on their behalf. Oxford police said the department received an emergency call after 1 a.m. Sunday from passersby who saw two people injured in the parking lot behind City Hall. Mayor Robyn Tannehill said the student who died was 21-year-old Walker Fielder of Madison, Mississippi. Fielder was a 2020 graduate of Jackson Academy in Jackson, Mississippi. The injured student was transferred to a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Oxford police told WRAL-TV that she is 20-year-old Blanche Williamson of Raleigh, North Carolina. Williamson graduated from Episcopal High School, a boarding school in Virginia.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two teenagers were killed Saturday evening when the vehicle they were in traveled off Farm Road 170 near Republic and struck a tree. Two other teenagers were taken by ambulance to CoxHealth Hospital in Springfield. According to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, a total of four teenagers – ages 15 and 16 – were riding in the 2005 Honda Accord. At 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the vehicle was traveling east on Farm Road 170, just east of Republic, lost control, traveled off the left side of the roadway, and struck a tree, the patrol reported. The Republic district provided some details to teachers, staff and parents late Sunday. The two students killed were a 16-year-old male from Republic and a 15-year-old male from Billings.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A police officer shot an armed man at the Billings Clinic Emergency Department on Sunday, the Billings Gazette reports. When officers responded to a report of an armed man at the hospital, the man fired one round. An officer fired one round, hitting the suspect, who was then taken into custody, according to a social media post from police. Police said no hospital staff or patients were injured in the incident, according to the news outlet.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Record-low temperatures are expected Tuesday in Omaha, Lincoln and Norfolk, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “A cold front dropping down from Canada will be sitting right over the top of (eastern Nebraska) Tuesday morning,” Taylor Nicolaisen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Valley, said Sunday. “The records for Omaha, Lincoln and Norfolk could be in trouble, especially Lincoln.” The low temperatures for all three cities were set in 1972 – Omaha recorded 20 degrees, Lincoln 21 and Norfolk 18. But the cold won’t last. Highs in eastern Nebraska expected to rebound into the 50s to low 60s on Wednesday, according to the news outlet.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Nevada reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,130 new cases. That’s down 11.9% from the previous week’s tally of 1,283 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Nevada ranked 46th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: New Hampshire public health officials say they see a dangerous combination ahead: a winter rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and low interest in coronavirus booster shots, especially the new bivalent dose targeted at omicron. Approximately half of Granite Staters eligible for the first booster have gotten one and far fewer, about 35%, have received a second, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has not reported state-level uptakes of the new bivalent booster but has put the national rate at just 4%. “It’s one thing to have the vaccine,” said Dr. Sally Kraft, vice president of population health at Dartmouth Health, in a briefing on the bivalent booster Tuesday. “It’s another to get that vaccine in people’s arms.” On Friday, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services asked lawmakers for approval to use $8.9 million in federal pandemic aid to expand access to vaccines and antiviral medications.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Democrats in competitive Garden State congressional races vastly outraised and outspent their Republican challengers in the three summer months after the state’s primary. In the 7th Congressional District, Rep. Tom Malinowski – who faces a tough reelection effort after redistricting added more Republican-leaning towns to the district – raised more than anyone else in the state, at over $1.8 million, and spent $3.3 million, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, due Saturday, which cover campaign activity from July through September. He collected more than twice as much in donations as his challenger, Thomas Kean Jr., who raised $866,000, and spent three times the $1 million that Kean paid vendors. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of the 11th District spent more than any other congressional contender over the summer, $3.7 million, more than 21 times what her Republican opponent, Paul DeGroot, managed with $175,000. She raised $970,000 to DeGroot’s $171,000. Rep. Josh Gottheimer of the 5th District continued to stockpile an eye-popping amount of money, with more than $14 million in the bank after raising another $1.1 million and spending $1 million in the third quarter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Roswell officials say the city’s UFO Festival had an economic impact of more than $2 million. The Roswell Daily Record reports the Roswell City Council’s finance committee looked earlier this month at an economic report for the event. It indicated more than 40,000 visitors came to the four-day festival, which ran June 30-July 3. The cost for the city to mount it was more than $200,000. Officials applauded the results as a “10 to 1 return on your money.” Staff who put together the report reviewed gross receipts taxes, occupancy or lodgers’ tax, ticket sales and other factors. They also analyzed data from trash collection to estimate the number of visitors. This year’s festival marked the 75th anniversary of the alleged Roswell Incident. Something crashed at what was then the J.B. Foster ranch in 1947, with the U.S. Army announcing it had recovered a “flying disc” but later saying the debris was merely the remnants of a high-altitude weather balloon. Speculation about extraterrestrials and government cover-ups has existed ever since, inspiring books, movies and TV shows. The milestone anniversary brought various businesses and groups together to organize 34 events for the UFO Festival.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Are your New York state license plates peeling or falling apart? The New York state Department of Motor Vehicles will replace them for free. “We are encouraging New Yorkers who have peeling license plates to get new ones, without any charge, to avoid the risk of being ticketed and having to pay a fine,” DMV Commissioner Mark J.F. Schroeder said. A driver can be ticketed if their plate number is no longer clearly readable. Customers who want the next available standard plate number for free can email the DMV at dmv.sm.peelingplates@dmv.ny.gov.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: Two people were shot and others were injured as they fled gunfire that broke out at a North Carolina college homecoming concert on Saturday night, officials said. Officers called to the campus of Livingstone College in Salisbury around 11 p.m. found two people shot and others who were hurt as attendees fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. There was a fight during the concert and one person, who isn’t a Livingstone student, fired one or more shots, police and school officials said in a joint statement. The school’s priority is to ensure students’ mental health and evaluate public safety measures to create a safe environment, Livingstone President Dr. Anthony J. Davis said in a statement. The college is cooperating with police as they investigate, he said. “I am saddened because our students, alumni, family and friends were exposed to this senseless act of violence,” Davis said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Congressman Kelly Armstrong has raised nearly $2 million for his reelection bid for North Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat, the Bismarck Tribune reports, outraising his independent challenger, former Miss America 2018 Cara Mund. Recent campaign finance reports indicate Armstrong has more than $1.8 million to Mund’s $77,790. This is the first official comparison of the two candidates’ fundraising efforts, according to the media outlet.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Democratic Rep. Jeff Crossman says he would drop an appeal of the state’s six-week abortion ban if elected attorney general over Republican Dave Yost. Crossman said he would refuse to defend Ohio’s law, which bans doctors from performing abortions after cardiac activity is detected, in court. As a state lawmaker, he voted against the six-week abortion ban, but it passed the GOP-controlled Legislature anyway. Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in 2019. But Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Christian Jenkins recently blocked that law indefinitely. Yost filed an appeal Wednesday with the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Crossman said he would drop that appeal. “I intend to end this crusade against women and protect their constitutional rights,” Crossman said. “I will end the appeal immediately and I will honor the court’s decision.” Yost campaign spokeswoman Amy Natoce slammed Crossman for not defending Ohio’s law. “He literally just promised to cancel democracy because he doesn’t like a law passed by the General Assembly. Doesn’t that bother you?” she asked. “The attorney general has a sworn duty to defend laws passed by the people’s elected legislators regardless of his personal opinions – something Jeff Crossman is too inexperienced and morally bankrupt to understand.” Practically speaking, that might not end the appeal. In 2014, then-Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, a Democrat, refused to defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, so outside attorneys handled the case instead.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Authorities are trying to determine if four bodies found in an Oklahoma river are those of four men who were reported missing several days ago after leaving a home together. Police in Okmulgee, about 40 miles south of Tulsa, said Friday that the bodies of four males had been found in the Deep Fork River. They have been sent for autopsies. Police said they’ve been searching for four friends – Mark Chastain, 32, Billy Chastain, 30, Mike Sparks, 32, and Alex Stevens, 29 – who were believed to have left a house in Okmulgee on bicycles on the evening of Oct. 9. Mark Chastain’s wife reported that he, Billy Chastain and Mike Sparks were missing, police said Tuesday. A few hours later, Alex Stevens’ mother reported him missing, police said. The bodies were discovered after a passerby saw something suspicious in the river near a bridge, police Chief Joe Prentice said. The bicycles have not been found, Prentice said. Police did not immediately respond to a message left Sunday. The men were all from Okmulgee, which has a population of around 11,000.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: Twenty-five Oregon mayors joined together for the common goal of creating a strategy to address the statewide homeless crisis using funding and construction investments, submitting the plan to state officials Friday. A subcommittee on the Oregon Mayors Association put together the request calling for a partnership between the cities and the state to fund a response to local homelessness and preventative programs – totaling about $123 million annually. In addition to the annual funding for those programs, the plan also calls for construction investments for shelters and transitional housing projects. The letter to legislators highlighted the crisis, stating the municipal leaders “cannot be left to solve this statewide crisis” on their own. “The No. 1 issue throughout Oregon – in both rural and urban communities, large and small – is homelessness. We know this humanitarian crisis is impacting both the individuals directly experiencing homelessness as well as communities at large,” stated the OMA letter. Although many cities have individual or regional programs to address local issues, the statewide crisis has exceeded their “individual capacity.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state and national Republican parties are suing anew in the state in an effort to block some mail-in ballots – those lacking the voter’s handwritten date on the outside envelope – from being counted in November, when voters will elect a new governor and U.S. senator. The GOP’s filing late Sunday went straight to the state Supreme Court, with barely three weeks left before Election Day. The court does not have to take up the lawsuit. “The time for the Court to act is now,” lawyers for the Republican Party told the justices in the lawsuit. The effort by Republicans to ensure that improperly dated or undated ballot envelopes are thrown out could help their candidates in tight contests around the state. As of Friday, nearly 1.2 million voters had applied for a main-in ballot, with applications from registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by an almost 4-to-1 ratio. Throwing out undated ballots would theoretically ensure that more Democratic ballots are tossed out, helping Republican candidates. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration last week told counties that they are expected to include ballots with undated or improperly dated envelopes in their official returns for the Nov. 8 election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A jury has convicted a former corrections officer at the Adult Correctional Institutions of having sexual relations with two female inmates over the course of a year. Collins Umoh, 44, of Warwick, on Thursday was found guilty of three counts of criminal sexual conduct with an inmate under his direct custodial supervision between 2017 and 2018 after a five-day trial before Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Montalbano, according to an announcement by Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office. The state was unable to proceed with four additional counts that were subsequently dismissed, said Brian Hodge, spokesman for the office. He declined further comment. Umoh had been a corrections officer for 11 years at the time of his arrest in May 2019. Authorities at the time accused him of having sex with three women housed in the Gloria McDonald Correctional Facility between July 2017 and August 2018. “This agency has no higher priority than running safe, secure and constitutional facilities, and the protection of ACI inmates from sexual misconduct is something we take particularly seriously,” Patricia A. Coyne-Fague, director of the state Department of Corrections, said in an email at the time of his arrest. “Anyone involved in sexual misconduct will face significant consequences.” Assistant Attorney General Daniel Carr Guglielmo prosecuted the case, with State Police Detective Herb Tilson leading the investigation with the assistance of the Department of Corrections Office of Inspections. Umoh is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 15. The charges are punishable by up to five years in prison and/or a fine of $10,000. Umoh’s lawyer, Stefanie Murphy, could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: Hundreds of incorrect absentee ballots were mailed to Spartanburg County voters due to an error by the vendor who prints them, county officials said Wednesday. “This is an unfortunate situation, but thankfully there is time to correct it,” Elections Director Adam Hammons said in a statement. “My office is working hard to ensure every affected voter receives the correct ballot as soon as possible, giving the voters ample time to return them before 7 p.m. on Election Day.” Hammons said after sending to the vendor the file of voters’ names to be sent a ballot, his office identified one voter that had applied for an absentee ballot but later moved out of the county. He said his office asked the vendor to remove the voter from the file prior to printing and mailing the ballots. “During that process, the data shifted, unbeknownst to the vendor, causing the error,” Hammons stated. County spokeswoman Scottie Kay Blackwell said the county elections office is immediately mailing a new, correct ballot to all 699 voters who received the incorrect ballot. The office is also reaching out to voters directly, telling them the correct ballots will arrive in an envelope with a yellow stripe, she said. “The issuing and return of the new, correct ballots will be tracked by the elections office, ensuring that only one ballot is counted for each voter,” Blackwell stated. She said voters who are unsure if they’ve been impacted by the error can visit scvotes.gov and click on “Get My Sample Ballot.” If the sample ballot matches the one they received in the mail, they will know they received the correct ballot.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: Authorities say an inmate who tried to escape from a hospital where he was receiving treatment was caught within 10 minutes. The 26-year-old man who was housed at the Yankton County Jail had been taken to Avera Sacred Heart Hospital for a medical issue Thursday evening when he ran away from a correctional officer, the Yankton Press and Dakotan reported. The suspect was apprehended less than two blocks away, according to the Yankton County Sheriff’s Office. He was charged with first-degree escape, which carries a maximum charge of two years in prison.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: A campground at Great Smoky Mountains National Park that has been closed for nine years has been reopened, park officials said. Look Rock Campground is a 68-site facility that provides camping along one of the park’s most scenic drive, according to Superintendent Cassius Cash. The campground opened Saturday and remains available through Nov. 13. “We are grateful for the voices who supported us in our efforts to secure the needed funding for repairs, including the Friends of the Smokies and their donors,” Cash said in a news release. Look Rock Campground and Picnic Area were closed in 2013 after the water utility systems failed. The picnic area reopened with limited services after the park received funds in 2019 to install an accessible vault toilet. The water system has now been completely replaced, with access to flush toilets and potable water. Campground sites were rehabilitated. Ten sites were renovated to accommodate larger recreational vehicles and offer the first electric and water hookups in a park campground, the park said. The park received $4.7 million for the work from campground fees, donations and federal funds. Campground reservations must be made through Recreation.Gov.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A Fort Worth police said an officer fatally shot a 29-year-old man who pointed a handgun at him after police responded to a call from the man’s mother, who said he was damaging her home with a hammer. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office has identified the man killed early Sunday as Taylor Grimes. Fort Worth police said that during the mother’s 911 call late Saturday, the man could be heard saying he would hurt his mother if any officers responded. Police said that when officers arrived, Grimes came to the door holding a handgun, closed the door and then refused to leave the house. The SWAT unit and hostage negotiators then arrived and tried to convince Grimes to surrender and to allow his mother to leave the house, police said. When his mother eventually left the house, Grimes was seen standing in the doorway, pointing a handgun at an officer, police said. Police said that the officer fired his weapon, striking the man. The medical examiner’s office said Grimes died in the living room of the home.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Provo has a new acting chief of police after the sudden resignation of police chief Fred Ross, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Ross didn’t cite specific reasons for his resignation, other than saying that the job had “been determined to not be sustainable.” He was appointed to the role in November 2021. “After discussing this with my family,” Ross continued in a statement, “I’ve determined it is in my best interest personally and professionally to resign my position as chief of police, effective immediately. I thank you sincerely for the honor of serving you, the department, and the people of Provo.” Mayor Michelle Kaufusi appointed Capt. Troy Beebe, a 24-year veteran of the Provo Police Department, as the acting chief in an early Monday announcement, according to the news outlet.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Students will be taking a different standardized test this spring. Students will no longer take the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) and the Vermont Science Assessment (VTSA) tests that they have since 2015. The new test, Cognia, encompasses the subjects of English language arts, math and science and will first be administered in the spring of 2023. The Agency of Education chose Cognia after the former testing provider’s contract was up, noting Cognia’s focus on equity. “Cognia’s approach to diversity, equity and inclusion in the development and implementation of assessments aligns with Vermont’s values, and the accessibility and user experience of their testing resources will make working with the assessments easier for students, families and educators,” said Dan French, Vermont’s secretary of education.\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: A man has been charged in a shooting at an outdoor gathering over the weekend that sent eight people to hospitals, police said. Harrisonburg police arrested Tyreaf Isaiah Fleming, 20, of Harrisonburg, on Sunday afternoon, the department said in a statement. Fleming is charged with attempted murder, aggravated malicious wounding and firearms offenses, police said. Online court records do not list an attorney who could speak on Fleming’s behalf. Witnesses said shots were fired into the crowd at an outdoor gathering on Devon Lane in Harrisonburg around 2:20 a.m. Sunday, police said in a statement. Statements from witnesses and security camera video helped investigators identify Fleming as a suspect. Eight people ranging in age from 18 to 27 were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Police said they are investigating whether anyone else was involved in this incident.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap: The Navy has scrapped a plan to lease local base space to a developer to build a power plant that could feed Kitsap’s electricity grid when outages occur. “The project was determined to not be financially feasible,” said James “Ken” Johnson, a Navy spokesman. The Navy had offered up to 95 acres at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor of mostly forested lands and up to 10 acres of what are mostly surface parking lots at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton for lease. Johnson said the Navy had entertained multiple proposals that led to a potential leasee, but that leasee decided to drop out of contention earlier this year. Running power plants and facilities is nothing new for the Navy in Kitsap, a place where 13 nuclear-powered submarines are homeported along with two aircraft carriers powered by twin nuclear reactors. Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton is also home to a steam plant that generates heat for buildings at the base and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard using natural gas. But coinciding with the Navy’s initial proposal in 2020, Puget Sound Energy – owners of most of Kitsap County’s electricity grid – had made its own request for proposals to help make the grid more resilient. Among them is a plan to build a biodiesel-fueled power plant at a former rock quarry at Ueland Tree Farm, and several proposals for battery-fed energy storage in both the West Hills of Bremerton and in Suquamish. The Navy would not comment on any of those specific proposals. But Johnson said Navy officials are “focused on meeting the Navy’s goals for energy efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The deadline has arrived to register to vote in the Nov. 8 General Election. A voter registration form must be in the county clerk’s possession by Tuesday for people who register in person, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said. Registration may also be completed by mail, and that must be received or postmarked by Tuesday. Voters may also register online by the close of business of their county clerk’s office. Voters can download a mail-in form, register online or find the county clerk’s contact information at GoVoteWV.com. Warner says anyone who has moved, changed their name since the last election or wants to change party affiliation may update their registration by Tuesday. Warner’s office and county clerks around the state held more than 100 voter registration drives during the month of September. A total of 5,326 people in the state registered last month, Warner said. Absentee voting began Sept. 23. Early in-person voting starts Oct. 26 and continues through Nov. 5.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: A nationwide study ranked Wisconsin No. 1 in mental health. Despite a shortage of therapists and wait times for mental health providers that can stretch up to and beyond six months, the study, conducted by Mental Health America, found the Badger State still had enough high points to top other states when it comes to tackling its residents’ mental health needs. Compared to other states, fewer Wisconsin adults are reporting that their mental health needs are going unmet, more adults are seeking treatment and fewer students are being reported for emotional disturbances with their individual education program. Another possible reason for its elevated status is the fact Wisconsin has invested in the mental health needs of its residents, industry professionals say. The report, published Thursday, covers a range of measures, including adults with any mental illness, youth with major depressive disorder, and those struggling with mental health conditions who couldn’t receive treatment due to workforce shortages or a lack of insurance coverage.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Teton County Emergency Management will be testing its alarms Tuesday, Jackson Hole Daily reports. The county is testing its outdoor warning sirens to ensure they work for emergencies, such as inclement weather, incidents with hazardous materials and wildfire evacuations. “Most people associate outdoor warning sirens with tornadoes,” said Rich Ochs, coordinator for Teton County Emergency Management, in a press release. “Hearing a three-minute siren wail means that you should tune into local radio, All-Hazards Weather Radio, trusted online local media, or your phone for an alert.” According to the news outlet, the test will sound like a few short siren bursts and will go for no longer than one minute at a time, at siren locations in Teton Village, Teton Pines, downtown Jackson, Gregory Lane, Adams Canyon and Hoback Junction. Residents indoors will likely not be able to hear much, as the sirens are not designed to sound inside of buildings.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}]}

News outlets cite Guinness World Records as announcing last week that Poncho Via’s horns measured just over 10 feet, 7 inches as of last month, beating all previous records. The 7-year-old steer belongs to a family in Goodwater, just southeast of Birmingham. Poncho’s owner Jeral Pope says he brought Poncho into the family when the steer was 6 months old. The organization says the Pope family first noticed the potential of Poncho’s horns when he was about 4 years old and his horns were growing straight out instead of curving upward. Pope says Poncho is a gentle giant with a soft spot for apples, carrots and marshmallows.\n\nAlaska\n\nQuinhagak: Accelerating erosion is forcing villages in western Alaska to begin making plans to move. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports erosion caused by climate change threatens village infrastructure and could force the relocation of communities such as Quinhagak. A 2012 state report listed Quinhagak’s sewer lagoon and multipurpose building as top priorities for replacement or repair because of erosion and thawing permafrost. Officials say erosion now threatens Quinhagak’s airstrip, water treatment plant, and water and sewer system. An official says he does not know how they would close up the lagoon if erosion causes waste to leak into the Kuskokwim Bay, an important food source. Quinhagak has applied for a Bureau of Indian Affairs grant to help with moving and rebuilding the lagoon, which could cost $6 million.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s housing shortage has drawn more attention than ever before in recent months, prompting a stack of dream-big legislation, newly energized activism and a mayoral race that emphasized each candidate’s plan to keep Phoenix affordable. Yet the state continues to slide deeper into unaffordable territory. An Arizona renter with a minimum-wage job must now work 71 hours to afford a modest two-bedroom home, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In the Phoenix metro area, that figure rises to 75 hours of labor. Under a widely accepted standard for affordability, a household should spend no more than 30% of its income on housing costs. The NLIHC report assumes a median two-bedroom rent of $898 across Arizona, rising to just under $1,000 in the Phoenix metro area. The state’s minimum wage is $11 an hour.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has blocked a state law that prevents candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election. U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. on Monday granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the state from enforcing the blackout period for accepting campaign contributions. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has appealed the order and on Tuesday asked Moody to stay his ruling during the appeal. Attorneys for Peggy Jones, the Pulaski County woman who sued over the restriction, have said the blackout period prevents her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wishes to support in the 2022 election.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Park: A Southern California police force is welcoming a robot to the department. Huntington Park police says “HP RoboCop” will provide 360-degree high-definition video footage. It became an official member of the force at a Tuesday evening ceremony. The department says the blue-and-white rolling robot serves as an extra set of eyes for areas such as parks and buildings that police might not have time to patrol. HP RoboCop has been helping to patrol a park in the Los Angeles suburb for several weeks since it was previewed at a 5K run last month. HP RoboCop even has its own Twitter page.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A 10-year-old Colorado girl has scaled Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan, taking five days to reach the top of the iconic rock formation. Selah Schneiter of Glenwood Springs completed the challenging 3,000-foot climb last week with the help of her father and a family friend. Selah and her dad, Mike Schneiter, say it took them five days last week with family friend Mark Regier to reach the top of the California icon. Selah told KFSN-TV that the group’s method was to do the climb little by little, calling it taking “small bites.” Mike Schneiter told the television station in Fresno, California, that the entire family climbs and that he fell in love with his wife, Joy, 15 years ago while scaling El Capitan.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The man who promised to turn himself in if his wanted poster received 15,000 likes on Facebook has made good on his pledge. It just took longer than expected. Torrington police say 29-year-old Jose Simms called Enfield police Wednesday and asked them to pick him up because he was wanted. Enfield police turned him over to Torrington police, who held him on $30,500 bond. Torrington police posted Simms’ poster on Facebook on May 22. He contacted police through the site and agreed to surrender if the post received 15,000 likes. It quickly surpassed that number. Simms was being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on several charges. It couldn’t be determined if he has a lawyer.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: For more than 150 years, members of the city’s Episcopal community were baptized, married and eulogized at the imposing Cathedral Church of St. John in Brandywine Village. This year, after sitting vacant since 2012 due to declining membership and rising maintenance costs, the church will be reborn with a new purpose: housing the elderly. The Ministry of Caring has converted the historic Gothic Revival structure and a priest’s residence on its grounds into 17 apartment units for low- and moderate-income seniors. A new building adjoining the church adds 36 units to the new Village of St. John. The apartments will be offered to residents over the age of 62, with a maximum of four residents per unit and income restrictions determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Georgetown University graduate who launched a project to trace the family histories of hundreds of black slaves sold by the Jesuit college in 1838 and a Boston-based genealogical organization have teamed up to digitize the information and make it available to people researching family histories. The public announcement Wednesday of what’s known as the GU272 Memory Project coincided not only with Juneteenth – the annual observance of the 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery in America – but also with the anniversary of the 1838 sale of 272 of the more than 300 slaves the Washington, D.C., college sold over a five-year period. In addition to documents, photographs and the indexed genealogies of thousands of descendants, the project includes recorded interviews with dozens of living descendants.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: Boeing says it’s moving the headquarters of its space and launch division to the Sunshine State. The company said Wednesday that it was moving the space division headquarters from Arlington, Virginia, to Titusville on Florida’s Space Coast. Boeing official Leanne Caret says it makes sense to move Boeing’s space headquarters to Florida, where so much space history has taken place. The company also is working on several future launches. Florida is home to the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base. Company officials say the move won’t affect space operations in other states, such as Alabama, California, Colorado, Louisiana and Texas. Boeing spokesman Daniel Beck says the company isn’t saying how many jobs will move to Florida, but the number will be small.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta’s mayor says she hopes to improve the city’s reputation through media coverage and her administration’s initiatives. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms spoke Tuesday at the Atlanta Press Club about her concern that the city is viewed locally and nationwide as corrupt. She asked journalists to be mindful of how their reporting affects the city’s reputation, and she encouraged news leaders to balance coverage of positive and negative stories. Bottoms mentioned launching My Brother’s Keeper in Atlanta – a program created under former President Barack Obama’s administration that pairs boys with mentors. And she spoke about opening a homeless resource center with money remaining after hosting the Super Bowl. She said these efforts and highlighting positive news will make strides in the right direction.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Vacation rental registrations have been coming in to Hawaii County faster than workers can process them. West Hawaii Today reports the county Planning Department processed 226 registrations as of early last week. Paper application forms were stacked in several boxes awaiting processing. The applications are the result of a new law requiring all vacation rental owners in existence as of April 1 to register their property by Sept. 28. Registrants must pay a $500 fee and show that their transient accommodations taxes, general excise taxes and property taxes are paid in full. Vacation rentals are defined as dwellings that are rented for a period of 30 consecutive days or less and where the owner or operator does not live on the building site.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A citizens group is launching an initiative drive to raise the state’s $7.25-an-hour minimum wage. The Idaho Press reports that while lawmakers haven’t raised the minimum wage in a decade, 26 other states have increased theirs in the past five years alone. That includes 17 that raised minimum wages by legislation and nine other states by voter initiative. Idaho is a low-wage state overall, with the average weekly wage in 2018 lower than all but two other states. The group, Idahoans for a Fair Wage, is organizing a signature drive to get an initiative on the ballot. It would raise Idaho’s minimum wage to $8.75 initially, raising it another dollar a year for the next two years. After four years, the wage would be set at $12 an hour, after which increases would be tied to the consumer price index.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A wet spring and dangerous flooding have created a nasty byproduct – more mosquitoes. The Illinois Department of Public Health says the flooding has made conditions ripe for floodwater mosquitoes. They’re also known as nuisance mosquitoes and don’t carry disease like other types. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of public health, says it’s always important to be protected from mosquito bites. She says mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus prefer hot, dry conditions. But nuisance mosquitoes that flourish in wet weather can still pose a threat. A bite from one of them can become infected if it is scratched and becomes a wound. Precautions include avoiding outdoors between dusk and dawn, wearing light clothing over all exposed skin and using approved repellant.\n\nIndiana\n\nWolf Lake: The owner of a small northern Indiana town’s former hospital that’s become a medical museum is looking for someone to take it over. The Luckey Hospital Museum building in the Noble County community of Wolf Lake dates to 1931, when it was opened as a hospital by Dr. James Luckey. After closing in the 1950s, the building was used as a nursing home and apartments before two great-nieces bought it in 2000 and started displaying their collection of medical memorabilia. Shirley Hile, 83, tells The (Kendallville) News Sun that she can’t keep up the museum anymore since her sister died a year ago. Hile hopes a buyer will keep the museum intact. A museum anniversary celebration is planned for July 13.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds says a new social media and advertising campaign is designed to draw attention to the state’s quality of life in hopes of attracting new workers. At the announcement of a newly branded “This is Iowa” campaign, Reynolds unveiled a state-produced video that shows New York City residents being shown photos of properties they assumed were nearby, only to learn they are in Iowa. The video records their shock at hearing the prices for such large, luxurious apartments and houses. Iowa has a chronic worker shortage, and attracting more people is one of Reynolds’ priorities. She held her announcement at a downtown restaurant owned by Alexander Hall, who sold several New York restaurants four years ago and moved to his wife’s native Iowa. He’s now planning his fourth dining location. Reynolds says Hall’s experience demonstrates that when people spend a year or two in Iowa, they stay.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: Officials in this western Kansas city are sweating over a nearly century-old swimming pool that leaks about 200,000 gallons of water every day. The Kansas News Service reports that Garden City water resource manager Fred Jones says the water loss at the Big Pool is excessive, even for a pool that holds about 2 million gallons. Assistant city manager Jennifer Cunningham says refilling the Big Pool costs $1,000 a day, and the city spends up to $800,000 on repairs, staff and water for the pool every summer. She says recoating the deep end of the pool with concrete would cost $750,000, but it wouldn’t be cost-effective. Concrete expands in heat and contracts in the cold, so it breaks down as the seasons change. She supports replacing the pool with a sturdier option.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A project that would bring high-speed internet across the state will be delayed because company representatives say an “abundance” of squirrels have chewed through wiring. Lawmakers in the Capitol questioned reports of ravenous squirrels Tuesday, blocking officials in charge of the KentuckyWired project from borrowing an additional $110 million. KentuckyWired was started in 2015 under former Gov. Steve Beshear to boost Kentucky’s internet infrastructure. Officials are now saying squirrels damaged cable that was supposed to be up and running in April. This isn’t the first time the project has been denied extra funds. In February, lawmakers blocked a request for an additional $20 million for “unanticipated borrowing costs.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Weekend memorial services have been scheduled for singer and musician Malcom “Mac” Rebennack Jr., better known by his Voodoo-inspired stage name, Dr. John. Rebennack, a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, died June 6 at age 77. The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival says memorial services are set for Saturday at the historic Orpheum Theater in downtown New Orleans. Public visitation starts at 7 a.m. and runs until 10:30 a.m. A service running from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Orpheum will be invitation only but will be broadcast on WWOZ FM. There was no immediate word on any music and entertainment stars who might attend. That will be followed by a public “second line parade” that will begin at the theater.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The National Audubon Society is getting involved in a lawsuit over the future of a national monument in the ocean off New England because of the area’s importance to seabirds, especially colorfully beaked puffins. Fishing groups sued in federal court against creation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which former President Barack Obama designated in 2016. The case is on appeal. Court documents show Audubon has moved to file a friend-of-the-court brief in favor of keeping the monument. Lawyers for the fishing groups have said the monument was illegally created by Obama using the Antiquities Act. But the nearly 5,000-square-mile area is especially important to Maine’s vulnerable Atlantic puffins, says Karen Hyun, vice president of coasts for Audubon. The health of the puffin population is a tourism boost for Maine, she says.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A carnivorous plant recently discovered by botanists is the first of its kind in the state. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced Tuesday the discovery of a dwarf sundew near Nassawango Creek in Worcester County. It was reported growing in open areas with wet, peaty sand, according to a Facebook post. “Dwarf sundew is an insectivorous plant with a unique way of catching its prey. The paddle-shaped leaves of the sundew form a rosette at the base and are densely covered with hairs that exude a clear, sticky liquid, which attracts and traps various kinds of insects,” the post says. The plant is the smallest native species of sundew in the U.S., according to the post. There are other species of sundew in Maryland, according to DNR. Dwarf sundew is not in the same family as the Venus flytrap, but both are considered carnivorous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials are expanding an early college initiative that allows thousands of students to study and earn college credits before they even graduate from high school. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and state Education Secretary James Peyser announced $900,000 in grants being awarded for programs involving 13 high schools and eight public colleges, starting in the fall. State officials say the early college programs combine traditional high school classes with courses offered by a local college or university, allowing students to focus on an area of study while earning up to 12 college credits at no cost. High schools in Boston, Framingham, Fitchburg, Haverhill, Lynn, Leominster and Marlborough are among those receiving grants and bring to 35 the number of high schools with early college programs.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: Michigan State University was named the most secretive public agency in the United States by the nation’s largest organization of investigative journalists, recognizing what award committee chair Robert Cribb called MSU’s “unrelenting commitment to ensuring transparency was avoided.” Investigative Reporters and Editors named MSU the winner of the Golden Padlock Award at its annual conference in Houston on Saturday. “MSU was nominated for keeping sweeping sexual assault scandals under tight wraps, including serial abuse by disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar and hundreds of student complaints against faculty, staff and students,” IRE Executive Director Doug Haddix wrote in a May 28 letter to acting Michigan State President Satish Udpa. Udpa did not respond to the letter or Haddix’s invitation to attend IRE’s annual awards luncheon.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A leaked email has raised new questions about how state and federal regulators handled a major permit for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The email asks Environmental Protection Agency officials not to file written comments on the water quality permit during Minnesota’s public comment period, which had the effect of keeping the federal regulators’ multiple criticisms out of the public record. The Star Tribune reports the email appears to support accusations by PolyMet’s critics that the two agencies suppressed regulators’ concerns about pollution risks of the mine. The state approved the permit in December. The email from a top Minnesota Pollution Control Agency official was released Tuesday by the union representing employees of the EPA’s regional office in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: Academy Award winner Allison Janney will take the stage at a local theater in a fundraiser for the venue’s restoration project. The Natchez Democrat reports stars from the upcoming film “Breaking News in Yuba County” have volunteered to be in a production at the Natchez Little Theatre on Saturday night. The feature was filmed in Natchez and stars Janney, Mila Kunis, Awkwafina and Regina Hall. The event will feature Janney and a few “surprise” guests. Representatives from the theater’s board of directors say the proceeds would be used for funding youth programs and multiple restoration projects, including a remodel of the theater’s Mayweather Hall. Representatives say they hope to raise $350,000 and have already received donations from “all over the world.”\n\nMissouri\n\nEureka: An endangered wolf pup born at a preservation center near St. Louis has been named in honor of the St. Louis Blues’ Stanley Cup victory. Officials at the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka said the nearly 8-week-old American red wolf is rare and worthy of celebration, like the hockey win. The pup was named Gloria after the 1982 Laura Branigan hit that became the Blues’ unofficial victory song. Gloria is one of a littler of seven pups born April 23 at the Endangered Wolf Center. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that center director of animal care and conservation Regina Mossotti says there are fewer than 30 American red wolves left in the wild and about 200 in breeding programs. Forty-five of those have been born at the Eureka facility.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A conservation group is opposing planned races on state trails, saying the events would put runners and grizzly bears at risk. The Missoulian reports the U.S. Forest Service has granted a special use permit for a 31-mile ultramarathon in October from Whitefish to the top of Whitefish Mountain and back. The agency is considering a permit for the Foy’s to Blacktail Marathon in September. The trail course sends runner from the Blacktail Mountain ski area to Herron Park. The Swan View Coalition has asked the agency to rescind the permit for the ultramarathon and deny one for the marathon. Coalition chair Keith Hammer says granting the permits would promote risky behavior in bear habitat. Montana Trail Crew co-founder Jimmy Grant says the risks are “very minimal.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Education Department intends to provide school districts with guidance on students’ sunscreen use during the school year. Officials say various districts have wrestled with the issue and sought state direction. Rules vary from district to district. Some require the sunscreen be sent from home and require parents to sign permission notes guiding administrators on application. Some require notes from doctors, and some don’t. Some districts have no policies at all. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the state guidance says children should be allowed to possess and use over-the-counter sunscreen approved by the Food and Drug Administration without doctors’ notes, and the sunscreen need not be stored in the nurses’ office. A department spokesman says the guidance would not be binding on districts.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Silver State residents who live in areas most prone to wildfires could see their electricity intentionally cut. NV Energy already turns off customers’ power during fires when lines are damaged or aren’t working properly. But the utility announced last week that it would turn off power when there’s a high risk of wildfires, too. Chris Hofmann, the utility’s director of grid reliability, says planned outages would lower the odds that an electrical malfunction would spark a wildfire. Up to 15,000 customers in the Lake Tahoe Basin and the Spring Mountains could be subject to the outages. New equipment to monitor weather, fuel moisture and soil conditions has been installed in those areas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Visitors are expected to flock to the state this summer. The New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs says it is expecting to see a 2.7% increase in summer visitations and spending over 2018. As a result, the state is expecting to see about 3.6 billion overnight visitors and for spending to reach $1.9 billion for the summer travel season. As part of an event Tuesday to kick off the summer travel season, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell and local tourism partners gathered in downtown Littleton. Along with announcing the summer forecast, the Portsmouth Herald reports they also unveiled their summer marketing campaign, which aims to build on the “Live Free” brand. The department will focus its campaign on the New England market, as well as Canada.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: New Jerseyans are living healthier lives than their peers in other states thanks to lower rates of suicide and alcohol deaths, but opioid fatalities have skyrocketed, according to a report by a research group. The report by the Commonwealth Fund showed New Jersey could make bigger gains if its residents had more access to mental health services. “Their physical concerns are being addressed, but the mental health aspect is not,” says Linda Dayan, 23, of Allenhurst, and a medical student at the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University. The Garden State scored highly in the healthy lives category. For example, it had the third-lowest suicide death rate. It had the fourth-lowest alcohol death rate and the fifth-lowest adult-smoking rate. But drug-poisoning deaths have increased by 219% since 2005. They increased just 115% nationwide during that time, according to the report.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A CIA intelligence officer will be working at the University of New Mexico’s campus and will carry a teaching or research load comparable to faculty colleagues, according to a new agreement. The CIA officer is scheduled to arrive at the university in August as part of an ongoing relationship with the agency and the school despites protests from students in previous years, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Under a new contract between the university and the agency, the officer will participate in the academic life of the university just like other professors. Since UNM became a signature school, very few others have publicly identified themselves. Other than the University of New Mexico, the CIA has only publicized signature schools partnerships at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Baruch College in New York City, according to CIA news releases.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Horror and alarm over the discovery of what appeared to be a dead baby at a city park turned to relief and probably some embarrassment Tuesday when the blue-skinned corpse was revealed to be a realistic-looking doll. Police and paramedics rushed to Crocheron Park in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens after a woman out for a morning jog found the “baby” lying face-down in the grass. Detectives descended in droves to look for evidence. A crime scene tent was set up. Yellow tape blocked off the area. Police initially reported the child was 3 months old and had been pronounced dead at the scene. At some point, a closer inspection showed it was a doll or some sort of theatrical prop, its skin apparently colored to resemble decomposing skin. One giveaway was the baby’s T-shirt, which read, “the crawling dead.” The red lettering wasn’t initially visible because the doll was on its stomach.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouthern Pines: Some rising high school seniors do not have their ACT test scores because their answer sheets were never submitted. News outlets report more than 400 students at Pinecrest High School were notified Tuesday that they were affected. School leaders say the missing scores are due to “human error,” and appropriate personnel action has been taken. The school says it plans to administer the test again in the fall at no cost to the students. All juniors took the ACT on Feb. 20 and March 13. Pinecrest High School spokesperson Catherine Murphy says the school learned the tests weren’t submitted when ACT officials said they hadn’t received the answer sheets. Moore County Schools says it’s looking into security, processes and protocols for giving tests like the ACT.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials have confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in Lake Ashtabula. The state’s Game and Fish Department says an angler discovered a suspected zebra mussel last week and turned it in. Subsequent inspections found populations of zebra mussels of various ages throughout the lake. Lake Ashtabula is an impoundment on the Sheyenne River in Barnes and Griggs counties. It’s operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and open for boating, swimming, fishing, camping and skiing. The Game and Fish Department has now classified Lake Ashtabula and the Sheyenne River downstream all the way to the Red River as Class I aquatic nuisance species infested waters. Emergency rules go into effect immediately to prohibit moving water away from the lake and river, including water for transferring bait.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will help wrap up nearly a week’s celebration of the 50th anniversary of the famous 1969 Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio. Kennedy’s scheduled remarks Sunday come as part of Cleveland’s celebration of environmental science and sustainability half a century after the June 22, 1969, fire. The blaze became the iconic event of the U.S. environmental movement. Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, is president of Waterkeeper Alliance. The nonprofit environmental group fights to defend the fire-inspired Clean Water Act. Sunday’s celebration includes free afternoon admission to the Great Lakes Science Center, where shows will explore the properties of water and combustion. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is hosting live music. A ticket is required to tour the Rock Hall.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mayor David Holt has declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Holt helped kick off a week’s worth of events Monday with a mayoral proclamation to “reaffirm our city’s commitment that all people are welcome in Oklahoma City.” Others who joined the kickoff included Councilman James Cooper, who became Oklahoma City’s first openly gay councilman when he took office in April. Festivities include a parade Saturday that will roll by businesses catering to LGBTQ clientele along a stretch of road that was part of historic Route 66. Pride celebrations are happening throughout the U.S. in June, which also marks 50 years since a clash with police at the Stonewall Inn in New York became a catalyst for expanding LGBT activism nationwide and abroad.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The loss of public funding at one of the city’s homeless shelters will leave about 80 women needing a new place to stay in late July. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Salvation Army gave incomplete answers on a new application for taxpayer money, leading to the loss of funding. The Salvation Army Female Emergency Shelter started getting money in 2008 from the city, but the Joint Office of Homeless Services, created as the city and Multnomah County consolidated homeless services, devised a more robust application process. Salvation Army’s Oregon and Southern Idaho operations CEO Nancy Dihle says officials were unprepared for the rigor of the process and hope to be more competitive next time. The closure won’t reduce the total number of homeless shelter beds as new shelters open this summer and temporary shelters are extended.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is permanently recognizing Juneteenth, the cultural holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved black people in the United States. Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed legislation designating June 19 as Juneteenth National Freedom Day. Most states recognize it, and Pennsylvania lawmakers typically recognize the day by passing nonbinding resolutions. The celebration started with the freed slaves of Galveston, Texas. Although the Emancipation Proclamation declared slaves in the South free in 1863, it couldn’t be enforced in many places until after the Civil War ended in 1865. It was June 19, 1865, when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and his Union troops arrived at Galveston with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Under the law, employers aren’t required to treat June 19 as a legal or official holiday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWest Warwick: The Catholic Diocese of Providence is merging two of its parishes. WJAR-TV reports that St. Mary Parish and SS John and James Parish of West Warwick will merge July 1. The diocese said in a press release Monday that a decline in attendance and key retirements played a role in the decision. The diocese says St. Mary Parish is serving 150 people, a smaller number than a viable parish should have. St. Mary has also seen a decline in sacramental practices like weddings, baptisms and First Holy Communions, and the current pastor is retiring soon. St. Mary Parish was built in 1850 and is the oldest Catholic church building in use in the diocese. It will remain open for daily Mass and other liturgical celebrations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Jennifer Pinckney was hiding under a desk holding the mouth of her then-6-year-old daughter when Dylann Roof fired more than 70 rounds in Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, killing nine black worshippers. The new documentary, “Emanuel,” explores life after the June 17, 2015, shooting, as family members, friends and the community try to heal through faith and forgiveness. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney was killed by Roof. Jennifer Pinckney and her daughter were in her husband’s office when they heard gunshots in another room. Pinckney says watching the film is “emotional. I can’t help but to relive what happened.” “Emanuel,” which opened in theaters nationwide for a limited run Monday and Wednesday, is executive produced by Viola Davis and Steph Curry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A year after an independent safety review of Falls Park recommended more viewing platforms, walkways and railings, construction on those amenities is nearing completion. In June 2018, three months after a 5-year-old Iowa girl drowned at the park after falling into the Big Sioux River, an outside consultant hired to study safety protocols furnished a report to city officials outlining ways to reduce drowning risks at Falls Park. That led Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and the City Council in July to set aside $300,000 in leftover cash from the previous year’s budget for the design and construction of a “lower falls viewing area” with two platforms and railings that are tied into the park’s walkways with sidewalks. Mike Patten, a park development specialist for the city, says work on the project is expected to wrap up within the next couple weeks if weather cooperates.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis Brooks Museum of Art this week opens an exhibition devoted to a man once cherished and later scorned as “the most popular painter in the United States.” The paintings range from confectionary scenes of huggable cherubs “with cute little rosy cheeks and pudgy little legs” to a violent tableau in which “women are about to be taken away by centaurs to be raped,” in the words of new Brooks associate curator Rosamund Garrett. Titled “Bouguereau & America,” the exhibition contains 39 paintings by William Adolphe-Bouguereau (1825-1905), the French academic artist who became a millionaire in the era of the robber barons when his detailed, idealized, sentimental and teasingly sensuous canvases became prized by wealthy American collectors. Organized by the Brooks and the Milwaukee Art Museum, the exhibition is the first major Bouguereau show in North America since 1984.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A program meant to help restore storm-battered Galveston Bay oyster beds has gained support from a statewide conservation initiative founded by former first lady Laura Bush. The Galveston County Daily News reports Texan by Nature has picked Galveston Bay Foundation’s oyster shell recycling program as one of six programs across the state worthy of its support over the next year with the hope of expanding the program’s reach. Along with programs aimed at conserving wetlands, cleaning up rivers and preserving other natural systems, the oyster shell program has been named a Conservation Wrangler by Texan by Nature, which Bush founded in 2011. The nonprofit group’s mission is to bring together business and conservation leaders in Texas who believe the state’s prosperity depends upon conservation of natural resources.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah judge says the time has come to let a community board have final decision-making authority about who is entitled to buy homes and properties in a trust that once belonged to Warren Jeffs’ polygamous sect, ending court oversight that began 14 years ago. Judge Richard McKelvie made his ruling Tuesday despite hearing from attorneys for past and current members of the polygamous group who argued that court oversight is still necessary because the board picks favorites and isn’t transparent enough. Utah seized control of the trust in 2005 due to allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs and other sect leaders. A board of trustees formed in 2013 has overseen the resale of more than 200 homes and buildings to people with ties to the community on the Utah-Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: Gov. Phil Scott has signed a bill aimed at getting Vermont veterans who have served overseas to sign up on a national registry that tracks symptoms of those who have suffered from burn bit exposure. The bill requires the state health commissioner and adjutant general to work together to develop and make available information about the possible health effects of being exposed to chemicals from burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. Officials will contact all known veterans and ensure they have access to the registry and other resources. Scott signed the bill Monday at the Woody William Gold Star Families Memorial Monument in Northfield. He gave particular thanks to June Heston, whose husband, Gen.

Professors from Old Dominion University said in a recent report that the damages could seriously puncture the regional economy. The June 12 report said losses could equate to 40% of Hampton Roads’ gross domestic product. GDP is a measure of an economy’s health and accounts for the total output of goods and services. The report predicted a loss of 175,000 jobs and a decline in economic activity if the region’s infrastructure and military installations suffer major damage. The report was put together by the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency. The center was established by Old Dominion University, the College of William & Mary and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The state’s apple industry expects exports to India to slow down even more after the country tacked on a 20% retaliatory tariff, bringing the total duty to 70%. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports India added the tariff to apples and 27 other American products Sunday after the U.S. ended a preferential trade program with the country earlier this year. India had imported 7.8 million 40-pound boxes of the state’s 2017 apple crop by June 2018. It imported a record 8 million boxes by the end of season. It has imported 2.6 million boxes of the 2018 crop since last week. Northwest Horticultural Council President Mark Powers says the apples could depress prices for all growers if the industry cannot find alternative export markets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain State residents eat more hot dogs per capita – and fewer hamburgers – than any other state, according to a study by 24/7 Wall Street.

Meanwhile, the study found that West Virginians eat about 171 hamburgers per capita each year, the fewest among all states.

The proposal creates a statewide regulatory framework for the 5G technology, including provisions about where the small wireless facilities can be placed, height and size restrictions, and other requirements. In general, the bill prohibits local governments from regulating certain communications services or charging fees on infrastructure to support it. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Kuglitsch said Wisconsin has been at a competitive disadvantage because neighboring states have already enacted similar laws. Supporters are calling for quick action to get the technology in place, especially before Milwaukee hosts the Democratic National Convention next year.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Nearly 100 people expressed opposition to any thought of demolishing the historic Cooper House on the University of Wyoming campus to make way for new student dormitories.

Councilman David Mann challenged that idea.\n\nThe meeting was designed as a public hearing to vet the details of a riverfront development that allows a music venue to be built, moves the concrete company that's there now, and ends in a land swap that allows land for a park in Lower Price Hill.\n\nBusiness owners at The Banks to city:Cut the politics and build the music venue\n\nAs part of the deal, the county would build the Bengals a parking lot on the site of the concrete company, Hilltop Basic Resources, and would be given more parking revenue than they get now.\n\nThe meeting grew tense during an exchange between Cranley and attorney Tom Gabelman, who works for the county and is the lead developer on The Banks. Cranley asked for a full accounting of the cost to relocate the concrete company, Hilltop Basic Resources.\n\nThat sparked a duel between Gabelman and Cranley at times talking over each other. They both accused each other of showing disrespect.\n\nCranley asked Gabelman what moving the concrete company will cost. Gabelman wouldn't answer, saying state law protects property negotiations.\n\n\"When will this happen?\" Cranley said.\n\nGabelman retorted, \"When will you convey the two acres of property?\"\n\nAt one point, Cranley asked for Gabelman to respect the city's attorney, Luke Blocher. Gabelman pleaded with Cranley, \"Have respect for your citizens as well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the chairperson of the meeting, Cincinnati City Councilwoman Amy Murray, tried to maintain order, asking the two to speak one at a time. Later during the hearing, she would liken it to streetcar meetings, some of the most contentious moments in recent council history.\n\nIn another exchange, Cranley was so angry at Gabelman he threw shade about how much money was being paid, mentioning the $21 million to his firms, as The Enquirer has reported.\n\nThe hearing revealed the level of opposition in the community toward the deal. Dozens of residents filled the Price Hill Recreation Center and expressed concerns about air quality, traffic and whether they would actually get a park.\n\nMark Wetterich, owner of Noramco Transport Company, which has an operation in Queensgate, attended the meeting to say the deal would put his company out of business as well as 40 to 50 employees out of jobs.\n\nThe company leases land to offload barges on the two acres of property Lower Price Hill residents want as part of the park they'll call Price's Landing.\n\n\"If Hilltop is moved to the property that we currently operate, we would be out of business,\" Wetterich said. \"No one has notified us we would have to move.\"\n\nSeveral organizations in the Lower Price Hill and Queensgate communities support the agreement to move Hilltop subject to a series of conditions, including the city purchasing the two-acre property for the park, rezoning the property to protect the future park and relocating Noramco.\n\nGabelman, Hilltop owner Kevin Sheehan, and an architect gave an hour-long presentation outlining the benefits of the music venue, the new concrete company and even a tutorial on the history of concrete. Gabelman described the design for the concrete company's proposed facility in Queensgate as \"iconic.\"\n\nThe presentation didn't reveal any new details and rehashed already public talking points.\n\nCranley wanted to know how this project would allow for the park to be built. Would the county and Hilltop pay for construction of Price's Landing?\n\n\"I don't think the county has committed,\" Gabelman said before Cranley interrupted.\n\n\"I'll take that as zero,\" Cranley said.\n\nMany unanswered questions remain surrounding the relocation of Hilltop and the future of the music venue. These include how much the Hilltop land will cost taxpayers, where an asphalt plant related to Hilltop will move to, and the park question.\n\nOn hand for the discussion were County Commissioner Denise Driehaus, Cranley, Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman and councilmembers Mann, Jeff Pastor and Murray, who called the public hearing as part of the council committee she chairs.\n\nCouncilman Greg Landsman told The Enquirer earlier in the day the county needs to resolve its issues with Hilltop and be transparent about all costs before council votes on land related to where it would move.\n\nAt the hearing, it seemed more like Murray and Mann wanted the issue to come before council immediately. Before that can happen, that legislation needs to be referred by Cranley.\n\nCranley wants a transportation study and an environmental one before decisions are made.\n\nThe timing issue is of paramount importance. Another music promoter, PromoWest, has started construction on a similar music venue across the Ohio River in Newport, set to open next fall.\n\nAnd the Bengals are concerned about tailgating, which the deal provides for. It's the parking arrangement that caused another disagreement between Cranley and the county. Cranley accused the county of going behind the city's back by promising additional parking revenues to the Bengals he felt the city was entitled to.\n\n\"The fact that this was done behind our back is insulting as we move forward,\" Cranley said.\n\nThe lease the county leaders agreed to 20 years ago with the Bengals for Paul Brown Stadium limits what the county can do, said Driehaus, president of the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners.\n\n\"Nobody dislikes the Bengals lease more than I do,\" Driehaus said. \"It's what the terms are. We went to the Bengals and said we need you on this.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/16/banks-music-venue-chris-seelbach-questions-need/2342713001/", "title": "Banks music venue: Chris Seelbach questions need", "text": "Two Cincinnati City Council members Monday questioned whether the city should approve plans needed to build a concert venue at The Banks, especially since a rival concert venue is rising in Northern Kentucky.\n\n\"Do we even need a music venue at The Banks?\" asked Councilmember Chris Seelbach.\n\n\"I’m not sure the answer is yes,\" Seelbach said. \"PromoWest has already broken ground. Can two very similar music venues survive? I think the answer is no.\"\n\nSince the county and city approved the idea of building a music venue at The Banks, choosing the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra's Music and Events Management Inc. to build and run it, Northern Kentucky officials announced they would build a music venue, developed by PromoWest, on the other side of the river.\n\nThat project is already underway. And while the parking structure needed to support The Banks music venue has broken ground, more approvals are needed before the venue itself can go forward.\n\n\"The Banks was supposed to be dense, with residential, jobs, small businesses,\" Seelbach said. \"Is a (music venue) really good for The Banks and keeping small business alive? ... Go back to OTR, where you see almost every small business thriving. That model supports small businesses.\"\n\nGet up-to-date news on your phone. Download our mobile apps here.\n\nCouncilman Greg Landsman agreed with Seelbach that a music venue may not be needed at The Banks, though he said he was still willing to consider the county's plan.\n\nAnd if it the music venue is built, then perhaps it should be built where no approvals are needed and nothing else would need to move.\n\n\"Then all this complicated mess goes away,\" Seelbach said. \"That’s where I am.\"\n\nNo Budget Committee members said they would vote for the development, as presented by the county, at this point.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the music venue would be built. Council unanimously approved the idea last year, bu that was before the PromoWest plan was announced.\n\nThen the county would buy Hilltop, a concrete company across the street from the stadium; that land would in turn become a surface parking lot for tailgating outside of Cincinnati Bengals games. Hilltop would then move to Queensgate in a land swap for Lower Price Hill land, where a park would be built.\n\nMayor John Cranley has raised questions about the total cost, what's being given to the Bengals in exchange for the team's approval to built the music venue as its lease provides for, the environmental impact, where a asphalt plant would be relocated and who would pay for a park promised to Lower Price Hill.\n\n\"This would not happen on the east side,\" Cranley said. \"This would not even be contemplated for a minute. That does not mean I don't think it's a valuable business. But leave it where it is.\"\n\nCity Manager Patrick Duhaney told council he was not comfortable recommending anything until he knows specific costs, which is something that typically happens before any deal is brought to council.\n\n\"We’re not going to pay big bucks to make this work,\" said Councilman David Mann, chairman of Council's Budget and Finance Committee. \"When it comes to remediating the park property, or the Cincinnati Bulk Terminal Contract or to move Noramco Transport Company there is way to do it unless there is support from the county or the Bengals. But we will try and make it work.\"\n\nMann said he is frustrated with what he called \"the prevailing attitude of some in city that this doesn't work.\"\n\n\"This is a complicated deal,\" Mann said. \"But we make complicated deals work all the time.\"\n\nCounty Commission President Denise Driehaus and county attorney Tom Gabelman explained to the council committee that taxpayers win in this deal because the Bengals are giving up $30 million owed to them by taxpayers and the deal limits fixes that will need to be made to the stadium.\n\nMore than two dozen people from Lower Price Hill, West Price Hill and East Price Hill spoke at the meeting, most of them concerned Hilltop and the asphalt would hurt their communities. Their concerns were similar to ones expressed in a public hearing held earlier this month in the community.\n\n\"Here we go again,\" said Steve Meyer. \"Either we're in the business of taking care of the citizens of Cincinnati who elect you or in the business of supporting the Chamber of Commerce. One way of another you have to figure it out.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/insider/2017/09/27/delaware-provides-tax-shelter-multi-million-dollar-masterpieces/678385001/", "title": "Delaware provides tax shelter for multimillion-dollar masterpieces", "text": "Geneva, Monaco, Luxembourg and ... Delaware?\n\nLong a darling of secretive limited liability companies, the First State is building a reputation as a prime location for out-of-state art collectors and investors to park their multimillion-dollar masterpieces and reap the tax benefits.\n\nIn the last two years, New Castle County has seen a proliferation of maximum-security art storage companies, including several Manhattan offshoots, that lock up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of paintings and sculptures by Old Masters and buzzworthy emerging artists.\n\nBut ordinary citizens will likely never see this work, including a 10-piece rocket installation.\n\nThat's because many of these one-of-a-kind creations will never leave their crates.\n\nArt buyers, including those more passionate about diversifying their portfolios than enjoying their artwork, can ship their purchases directly to Delaware storage facilities and avoid paying sales tax for as long as the items remain here. For the Manhattanite, that amounts to a nearly $900,000 savings on a $10 million painting.\n\nThe advantages don't stop there. Delaware doesn't tax inventory, it recently repealed its estate tax and it offers less expensive land for storage facilities ideally situated between New York and Washington, D.C., art experts say.\n\nAs Geneva and New York crack down on an opaque art market reeling from money laundering and tax evasion scandals, Delaware shines as a pro-business beacon, one that is, arguably, less likely to suffer loss from terrorists, natural disasters or art capers.\n\nSTORY: Delaware's unemployment rate continues to climb, bucking national trend\n\nSTORY: DTC's 'Something Wicked': Dazzling theatrical rocket ride\n\nSeveral storage companies offer direct, weekly shuttle service from Delaware to New York –– and back again. Masterworks are transported from cavernous warehouses straight out of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to New York City showrooms crawling with potential buyers.\n\n\"I've never been treated so courteously, friendly and positively than in Delaware,\" said Fritz Dietl, who owns the Delaware Freeport in a Newark, one of at least five art storage companies in Delaware. All are located in New Castle County.\n\n\"There's no better place to do business in the world.\"\n\nDietl, an Austrian-born New Yorker, went one step further than his local competitors by securing a Foreign-Trade Zone designation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2015. That means art shipped from abroad enters duty-free to his 36,000-square-foot warehouse.\n\n\"Think about it like playing Monopoly,\" says Patricia Cannon of the state Division of Small Business, Development and Tourism. \"No one can hurt you on home base.\"\n\nSince touting tax savings is considered gauche, Dietl and others emphasize that their facilities, collectively totaling more than 200,000-square-feet, benefit the broader community — not just their ultra-wealthy clientele — by bringing in new jobs, investment in derelict buildings and spinoff business for local accountants, lenders, lawyers and art conservators.\n\nDelaware also gains notoriety by catering to the high-powered art world, the business owners claim.\n\nBut local art lovers question the direct benefit to the First State. Each storage facility employs only a handful of people, their high-value holdings do nothing to boost government coffers and few, if any, storage sites have partnered with area museums to develop a lending program, which has been established in other states.\n\nRepresentatives from the Delaware Art Museum, Winterthur Museum and the Brandywine River Museum said they haven't been approached to display the stockpiled art, and they don't even know what's there.\n\nWinterthur has paid a couple of local facilities to store empty crates during temporary exhibitions, according to museum registrar Beth Parker Miller.\n\n\"Having someone in our backyard is a little more convenient,\" she said. \"Winterthur doesn't generate that much business for them.\"\n\nArt storage operators say their clients are a mix of dealers, pure investors, museums, inheritors of art both local and abroad, and collectors who own multiple homes with limited wall space.\n\n\"You keep collecting. That's an addiction,\" Dietl explained. \"That addiction feeds our warehouse.\"\n\nLocal gallery owners report they don't know any Delawareans who would want their collections stuffed in crates rather than on display.\n\n\"The people I know aren't buying paintings of mass value so they can store them and resell them,\" said Vicki Manning, co-founder of Somerville-Manning Gallery in Greenville.\n\n\"My clients are buying the work for their enjoyment.\"\n\nBehind the iron curtain\n\nLike bars of gold at Fort Knox, Delaware's hidden treasures are buried in unmarked, video-monitored fortresses in large industrial parks with multiple barriers to entry.\n\nThink of them as offshore banks for art, flush with million-dollar fire suppression systems and industry-validated climate controls — all in an effort to provide maximum assurance that their precious cargo is safe and secure.\n\nCompanies refrain from listing exact locations on their websites. Of the four that granted access to The News Journal, two refused to allow photographs of the actual storage areas. Others obscured packing slips.\n\nClient identities, along with the provenance of the art and the total value, remain a mystery.\n\n\"Discretion is a huge concern for our clients,\" acknowledged Derek Jones, executive director of Atelier Art Storage and Services near New Castle.\n\nEach storage facility is slightly different in terms of size, layout and market niche, but all sell square footage in large, open-air rooms filled with racks of artwork and unopened boxes, along with handling packing and shipping. Most also offer private rooms that function as glorified safety deposit boxes for customers seeking an added layer of security and anonymity.\n\nIntimate gallery spaces within the warehouses allow clients to have pieces inspected and appraised away from prying eyes.\n\nThat's where Kristin deGhetaldi comes in — escorted, of course.\n\nA graduate of the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, deGhetaldi can size up an easel painting's condition, analyze particular pigments and document any travel damage (which, she says, rarely happens).\n\nThe painting conservator has expanded her business by servicing local art storage facilities about once a month. The facilities, in turn, appreciate the local expertise and use it to help recruit clients.\n\n\"It's a particular niche that Delaware can fill,\" explained deGhetaldi, who also teaches at UD.\n\nLaunched in 1991, Bayshore Fine Art Storage is among the oldest of Delaware's art storage facilities and one of two local, family-owned businesses, along with Hopkins & Sons in New Castle. Both were longtime moving and storage companies that carved out a specialty in art.\n\n\"My stepfather got a call out of the blue one day from a private collector in California who asked if we could build him a room,\" said Bayshore Vice President Matt Larmore, who now operates two art storage facilities near Glasgow totaling 60,000 square feet. \"We've been growing the business ever since.\"\n\nThe company constructed vaulted chambers within its warehouses – described as buildings-within-a-building – to maximize security.\n\n\"The insurance guys like to tease me,\" Larmore said. \"We've built in so much redundancy but we are constantly asking ourselves what we can do better.\"\n\nLarmore admits he's not an art aficionado, but three of his competitors are. All came to Delaware within a six-month span in 2015.\n\nFirst was Philadelphia-based Atelier, which oversaw the relocation of the Barnes Foundation's 4,000-piece collection from Lower Merion to Philadelphia in 2012. Atelier put down roots in Delaware in the summer of 2015, largely thanks to Mati Bonetti de Buccini, wife of real estate developer Chris Buccini whose company The Buccini/Pollin Group has spearheaded the redevelopment of Wilmington.\n\n\"When we moved from New York City, I saw that Delaware had something unique to offer when it came to art storage,\" recalls Bonetti de Buccini, now director of Atelier's 40,000-square-foot space. \"I met with Derek and instead of competing we decided to partner up.\"\n\nAtelier's facility comes equipped with a fleet of 15 GPS-monitored vehicles that resemble refrigerated trucks to appear inconspicuous. Some big-ticket collections inside the warehouse necessitate their own heads of security and biometric readers that authenticate fingerprints.\n\nShortly after Atelier moved in, Crozier Fine Arts, a known commodity on the Manhattan and Hamptons art scenes, opened its seventh U.S. facility four miles away. The company was recently acquired by Iron Mountain, a $10 billion Boston-based document storage company.\n\nCrozier's more unusual art occupants have been Napoleon Bonaparte's hat and an enormous painting made of bubblegum that had to be stored flat.\n\nThe 41,000-square-foot New Castle warehouse is run by Randall Brockett, a striking figure with chin-length hair and a slight European accent whose romance with a Russian-born real estate magnate briefly captured the attention of New York City gossip columnists.\n\nWhile giving a tour to U.S. Sen. Chris Coons last month, Brockett noted that Crozier previously leased space from Bayshore to test the market. He applauded Delaware for its panoply of tax advantages, explaining that short-term clients are lured here because they can get in and out quickly with minimal fuss.\n\n\"All we want is for them to have their private jet serviced and incorporated in Delaware,\" the Democrat senator joshed.\n\nInternational intrigue\n\nPrivate jets are a fixture at Le Freeport Luxembourg, conveniently located next to the country's only airport with a paved runway.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Christie's operates a fine art storage facility within the Singapore FreePort. An auction house spokeswoman declined comment for this story.\n\nGeneva pioneered the freeport concept more than a century ago with bonded warehouses that temporarily housed commodities like grain and tea. Today, more than $100 billion in goods, including Van Goghs, Picassos and Gaugins, are believed to be held in Switzerland's custom-free zones. Freeports also store fine wines, diamonds, rugs, vintage cars, musical instruments, cigars and taxidermy.\n\nThe difference between a freeport and a regular art storage warehouse is that freeport clients are exempt from paying import taxes or duties, which can be 5 to 15 percent of the work's value. And if an artwork is sold at a freeport, the transaction tax is waived.\n\nNot surprisingly, this high-roller world has attracted controversy. The leaked Panama Papers in 2015 revealed that an alleged Nazi-looted painting by Modigliani had been stored in Geneva's tax-free vaults.\n\nFor the past two years, Yves Bouvier, owner of Geneva Freeport and partner in a Singapore facility, has been embroiled in a high-profile dispute with a Russian billionaire over selling works at huge markups. Bouvier has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSimilarly, billionaire international art dealer Guy Wildenstein was accused of hiding art and assets in a maze of foreign trusts and moving millions of dollars in artworks from New York to Switzerland. He was cleared of tax fraud earlier this year.\n\nArt storage is definitely a rich man's game, acknowledged Dietl, who wears a pressed shirt and sparse beard. \"When you invest in stocks, you don't pay use or sales tax. Art has become an asset in the same way.\"\n\nEdged with sunflowers, the Delaware Freeport shares grounds with a purveyor of forklifts and rail siding. Just past the loading dock and stark white viewing room, Dietl offers a glimpse behind the steel veil: Art stored at a comfortable 69 degrees with 50 percent relative humidity.\n\nA high school dropout who launched an art transportation company a quarter-century ago, Dietl says he has worked with every major museum around the world and relies on word-of-mouth advertising. Clients are charged a few dollars per square foot a month.\n\nDelaware art storage facilities generally charge customers 20 percent less than equivalent facilities in New York, according to Karen Boyer, founder of Elements in Play, a New York-based art advisory firm.\n\n\"If you're buying a $3 million painting and don't plan to hang it for a period of time, it makes perfect sense,\" she said.\n\nDelaware Freeport is one of only five sites in the state certified as a foreign-trade zone, along with the Port of Wilmington, the juice importer Citrosuco, the Delaware City Refinery and the Wilmington pharmaceutical company Noramco. Dietl pays the state $10,000 a year for the designation, according to Cannon, director of intergovernmental relations and special projects for the state economic development office\n\nIt's a \"marketing pitch,\" she said. Art has to be more than 100 years old for the customs duty to apply, anyway, \"and they’re not moving in and out of Delaware too often.\"\n\nBut the pitch apparently worked. Dietl says he's at capacity and is scouting a second Newark location to double his storage space.\n\nShipping art two hours south from New York is safer and more cost-efficient than sending it to halfway around the world, he said.\n\n\"It makes us the absolute equivalent to the Geneva Freeport.\"\n\nSoon, New York's first freeport could give Dietl and Delaware a run for the money.\n\nThis fall, ARCIS will open a 110,000-square foot facility in Harlem that can store as much as 2.5 billion worth of goods duty-free. Like the Delaware Freeport, ARCIS clients' valuables will be exempt from U.S. duty and excise taxes until they exit; New York state sales tax may still apply.\n\nLocated at a global epicenter for art and finance, the four-story, sustainable building is responding to pent-up demand after about 165,000-square-feet of art storage space that disappeared from Manhattan last year because of property turnover, according to ARCIS Executive Director Tom Sapienza.\n\n\"I don't see Delaware as competition,\" he said, explaining that ARCIS boasts the largest dock in the tristate area and was built to conform with the strict specifications of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Security features include both retina and vascular scanning upon entry.\n\nThe art storage market is boundless, according to Sapienza, because \"every day more art is being created.\"\n\nMarket research backs him up. While the mercurial art market contracted in 2015, global art sales are still estimated to be from $45 billion to $57 billion annually.\n\nLast year, nearly two-thirds of art collectors reported that investment returns were an important motivating factor in purchasing art compared to 47 percent in 2014, according to a Deloitte Luxembourg & ArtTactic Art & Finance Report.\n\nThat's troubling to art buffs like Barry Schlecker, who has been known to hyperventilate in the presence of a folk art piece made of mud or molasses. He now owns more than 400 of them and estimates his collection is worth around $50,000.\n\n\"To buy a piece of art and stick it in a vault so you can't see it and enjoy it – I don't get it,\" said Schlecker, who produces the Brandywine Festival of the Arts.\n\nHe acknowledged the lucrative business potential, however.\n\n\"I guess whenever you go to McDonald's, you're going to find a Wendy's or Burger King.\"\n\nHome-court advantage\n\nDespite the saturated landscape, Delaware's five art storage facilities have yet to join forces with dozens of museums across the state.\n\nOther states, like California, offer collectors tax exemptions if they ship an artwork to a museum in a state without sales tax and display it there for 90 days. When the piece is ultimately sent back, California waives its 7.25 percent sales tax and the museum exposure can boost the value of the art.\n\nBoth the Portland Art Museum and Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon have benefited from this arrangement. The Schnitzer Museum advertises on its website the tax benefits of its Masterworks on Loan program.\n\nBut don't expect the Delaware Art Museum to try something similar.\n\n\"We only take loans when the loans make sense for us,\" said Heather Campbell Coyle, the museum's chief curator.\n\nThe museum already displays less than 5 percent of its collection due to space constraints, she continued. Loaned artwork must fit into the exhibition schedule and allow \"us to present something meaningful to our community.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Manning said she agreed to present works loaned to her by California collectors looking for a tax break. She won't do it again.\n\n\"I can bring in work of that quality and have it for sale in my gallery,\" she explained.\n\nJohn Schoonover, grandson of popular Wilmington illustrator Frank Schoonover, said he doesn't begrudge art storage companies and their clients for making a buck.\n\nAsked how his grandfather, a former pupil of Howard Pyle, would react if his Hopalong Cassidy and Joan of Arc images were heaped in a plywood crate somewhere, the gallery owner responded diplomatically.\n\nIt \"goes with the territory\" of being a commercial artist, he said.\n\n\"Most of my artists are dead so they're not going to complain.\"\n\nTax deferral or tax dodge?\n\nThe art owners aren't complaining either. Experts say Delaware offers collectors – particularly pure investors – a number of tax advantages found in few other states.\n\nChief among them is Delaware’s lack of sales or use tax. Delaware is one of only five states hawking that benefit, and the only one in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n“It’s a huge difference, especially over a place like New York City where most of the art transactions originate,” said Jack Sullivan, a tax and corporate law attorney based in Manhattan.\n\nNew York City’s sales tax is 8.875 percent. Buy a $10 million painting in the Big Apple and have it shipped to Park Avenue? That’s an $887,500 tax bill.\n\nBut ship it to the home of tax-free shopping and the tax bill is a whopping zero.\n\nThere’s only one catch:\n\nThe sales-tax savings evaporates if the same New York City collector decides to retrieve the work from Delaware and hang it on his living room wall. That event is supposed to be reported in tax filings, but it's an honor system that experts say often gets ignored.\n\n\"It’s no different than when someone from Pennsylvania buys a TV at Best Buy in Wilmington and does not pay tax on it once they get home,” Delaware accountant Jordan Rosen said. “Enforcement is not what it could be and people are not as honest as they could be.” The system is fraught with \"chicanery,\" Sullivan agreed. Auction houses may claim to ship art to Delaware or a tax haven in Europe, but \"it really goes out the back door.\"\n\nSince gaming the system with a flat-screen TV is less of a financial hit to the government than, say, an N.C. Wyeth painting, state attorneys general have stepped up their investigations of tax-dodging art collectors.\n\nLast year, the Swiss Parliament also tightened regulations for freeports, after clients began shipping their work to less scandal-tainted locations, including in Delaware.\n\nTodd Levin, director of Levin Art Group consultancy in New York, advises his clients to just pay the sales tax in their home state and be done with it.\n\n\"In most cases, I'm not convinced that every T is crossed and every I is dotted,\" he said of the storage facilities.\n\nThat's a non-issue in tiny Delaware. Even the dead here get a tax break.\n\nThe General Assembly last summer voted to repeal Delaware’s estate tax, which tops out at 16 percent. Starting Jan. 1, that could save millions of dollars for the estates of the deceased that own more than $5.5 million worth of paintings and antiques stored here.\n\n“The repeal of the estate tax is a huge, huge thing that was on my wishlist for the past year,” said Brockett, the Crozier manager.\n\nAnother incentive for out-of-staters is that if they form a trust in Delaware, they can avoid paying estate taxes in their home state, according to legal experts.\n\nA trust is a legal entity similar to a small corporation that can hold assets, such as cash or property, and \"lend\" it to heirs tax-free. Trusts can last forever in Delaware, unlike in most states.\n\n“Artwork is something of a natural fit for a dynasty trust,” said Scott Swenson, a partner at Connolly Gallagher who heads the Delaware Bar Association’s estates and trusts section. “It means your family can retain it in perpetuity as long as it is legally owned by the trust.\"\n\n\"And the art can physically reside anywhere.”\n\nDespite those advantages, New York lawyers who work closely with high-wealth art collectors claim that Delaware's tax benefits are a bit overblown.\n\nSteve Schindler heads the art law group for the firm Schindler Cohen & Hochman and chairs the art law committee for the New York City Bar Association. Collectors often ignore the sales tax imposed by their home states, he said, and hire competent professionals to mitigate estate taxes and other costs.\n\n“I think there’s some clever marketing going on here,\" the Manhattan attorney said. “In my personal experience, I’m not seeing clients overwhelmingly gravitating to Delaware.”\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v.

Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

Her time of death was 1:31 a.m., 7½ after her originally scheduled time of execution, according to The Associated Press.\n\nAs both sides filed appeal after appeal to tip the scales in their favor, Montgomery spent her final moments in a cell within the brick execution building just steps away from the execution chamber.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Montgomery’s execution with a pair of orders just before midnight.

And they killed her anyway.\"\n\nMontgomery's attorneys have said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse beginning in her childhood and that she suffers from serious mental illness. Late Monday night, U.S. District Court Judge Patrick Hanlon granted a stay to halt the execution, citing the need to determine Montgomery’s mental competence, according to attorneys.\n\nCase details:What you need to know about Lisa Montgomery and her victim Bobbie Jo Stinnett\n\nTuesday’s legal battles began when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit declined to stay her execution less than 24 hours after a federal judge in Indiana granted a stay in her execution over concerns about her deteriorating mental health.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon a judge with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted another stay, throwing Montgomery's execution further, into question.\n\nAround 8 p.m., the high court lifted the stay issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but the Eighth Circuit stay remained in place until the near-midnight decisions by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court repeatedly split along partisan lines, with liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan ruling in ways that would have granted Montgomery a reprieve.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, that stay had been undone. Three judges with the higher appeals court reversed Judge Hanlon's order, saying that Montgomery's attorneys waited too long to bring their request for an execution stay to federal court. They also said that declarations attorneys used from three experts about the state of Montgomery's mental health relied on outdated information. Two of the experts had last seen Montgomery in 2016, and the other last saw her in 2010, according to the judges.\n\nIn 2004, Montgomery drove from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Bobbie Jo Stinnett, a 23-year-old dog breeder. She strangled Stinnett with a rope before performing a crude cesarean section and fleeing with the baby.\n\nMore:Lisa Montgomery, a Kansan who cut a baby from a mother's womb, was executed Tuesday.

In their clemency petition, they describe the severe trauma that shadowed Montgomery's childhood, and allege that she was not effectively represented by lawyers who first took on her case after the crime was committed.\n\nOn Jan. 9, Montgomery's lawyers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court asking that the justices stay her death sentence. The petition is an appeal of an earlier case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where the court ruled that the federal government acted against regulation when it scheduled Montgomery's execution for Jan. 12 despite an outstanding court order staying her execution.\n\nThat ruling fell apart after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed it, prompting Montgomery's lawyers to now take it up with the Supreme Court.\n\nTwo other executions set for later this week also were halted because the inmates tested positive for the coronavirus.

Shubb determined Papini, 40, should serve 18 months in prison followed by 36 months of supervised release after she admitted to the hoax and pleaded guilty in April to mail fraud and making false statements. She was also ordered to pay nearly $310,000 in restitution.\n\nThe sentence was much longer than attorneys had requested. Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence her to eight months in prison, while the defense asked for one month in custody and seven months of home detention.\n\nPapini read a statement to the judge, saying, in part: “I am so sorry to the many people who have suffered because of me. The people who sacrificed for the broken woman I was. The people who gave willingly to help me in a time that I so desperately needed help. I thank you all.”\n\nShe told the judge she was guilty of lying and dishonor, and was ready “to repent and to concede.”\n\nThe charges date to November 2016, when Papini was reported missing after she went out for a jog near her Shasta County home in Northern California. Three weeks later, she was found injured and alone on a highway about 140 miles away. She told police she had been abducted and tortured by two masked, Spanish-speaking women who kept her chained in a closet, held her at gunpoint and branded her with a heated tool.\n\nThe accusations led authorities to carry out an extensive search for the supposed Hispanic captors that came up empty for several years. She also received more than $30,000 from the state in victim compensation funds.\n\nYet her story fell apart when investigators in 2020 connected DNA from her clothing to an ex-boyfriend, who then admitted that the supposed kidnapping was a hoax.\n\nIn their sentencing memo, federal prosecutors said the hoax wasted resources and caused police to investigate innocent targets.\n\n“Papini planned and executed a sophisticated kidnapping hoax, and then continued to perpetuate her false statements for years after her return without regard for the harm she caused others,” prosecutors said in the filing. “As a result, state and federal investigators devoted limited resources to Papini’s case for nearly four years before they independently learned the truth: that she was not kidnapped and tortured.”\n\n“Papini caused innocent individuals to become targets of a criminal investigation,” prosecutors added. “She left the public in fear of her alleged Hispanic capturers who purportedly remained at large.”\n\nIn the defense’s sentencing memo, Papini’s attorney noted that she has admitted to the hoax and said her reputation had suffered enough as is.\n\n“Sherri’s years of denial are now undeniably over. Her name is now synonymous with this awful hoax. There is no escaping it,” attorney William Portanova wrote in the filing.\n\n“It is hard to imagine a more brutal public revelation of a person’s broken inner self. At this point, the punishment is already intense and feels like a life sentence,” he added.\n\nOutside court Monday, Portanova sought to distance the Papini of today from the one who carried out the crime.\n\n“Whatever happened five years ago is a different Sherri Papini than the one you see here today,” he said.\n\nHow new DNA technology helped solve the case\n\nThe break in the case came in 2020, when investigators took unknown male DNA on clothing she was wearing and tested it using the technology known as genetic genealogy. The DNA was connected to a family member of Papini’s former boyfriend, and investigators then took DNA from the ex-boyfriend to confirm him as a match, according to a 55-page affidavit released earlier this year.\n\nIn an interview with investigators, the ex-boyfriend admitted he helped Papini “run away” from what she described as an abusive relationship and housed her at his place in Southern California, the affidavit states. He said that she had injured herself, chopped off her own hair and asked him to brand her with a wood-burning tool as part of the ruse, the affidavit says.\n\nInvestigators corroborated the ex-boyfriend’s account in numerous ways, including from telephone records, his work schedule, rental car receipts, odometer records, toll records and an interview with his cousin, who saw Papini in the home.\n\nAuthorities confronted Papini with the new information and warned her that lying to authorities is a crime. Still, she stuck to her original story about two Hispanic women kidnappers and denied she had seen the former boyfriend, the affidavit states.\n\nAuthorities announced charges against her in March 2022 and she pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal a month later. Her husband Keith Papini also filed for divorce and custody of their two children, saying she was “not acting in a rational manner,” court records show.\n\n“The events of the past two months have been shocking and devastating,” Keith Papini said Monday in a statement. “My current focus is on moving on and doing everything I can to provide my two children with as normal, healthy and happy of a life as possible.”\n\nIn court in April, Papini said she was in treatment for anxiety, depression and PTSD starting in 2016 and also struggled in middle school.\n\nOn Monday she told the judge, “What was done cannot be undone. It can never be erased. I am not choosing to stay frozen like I was in 2016. I am choosing to commit to healing the parts of myself that were so very broken.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Stella Chan Cheri Mossburg", "Eric Levenson", "Stella Chan", "Cheri Mossburg"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2021/01/12/lisa-montgomery-execution-once-again-set-take-place/6635726002/", "title": "Lisa Montgomery executed in Terre Haute, first woman put to death ...", "text": "TERRE HAUTE — After a flurry of last-minute court orders, hours of uncertainty and one final plea to reconsider her competency, Lisa Montgomery became the first woman executed by the federal government in 67 years early Wednesday.\n\nMontgomery, 52, was executed by lethal injection at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute.

Federal prisons are required to cover the costs of all necessary health care treatments for inmates under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nJoshua Blecher-Cohen, an ACLU of Illinois staff attorney who represents Iglesias, said the directive represents “a real first step” toward Iglesias’ finally getting gender-affirming surgery.\n\n“This case has been full of delays and denials, as this opinion recognizes,” Blecher-Cohen said. “We are excited, but there is more work to be done toward actually making this happen.”\n\nIn her order, U.S. District Judge Nancy Rosenstengel of Illinois’ Southern District ordered the prisons bureau to conduct an immediate nationwide search for a qualified surgeon while providing detailed evidence of its efforts.\n\nThe judge also asked the bureau to demonstrate why it should not be issued sanctions or held in contempt for previous delays and violations of court orders that have repeatedly postponed the procedure. She ordered that high-level officials and staff representing the bureau and the U.S. Department of Justice appear at a future hearing to justify the misconduct.\n\nFor example, in December, the court ordered the Bureau of Prisons’ Transgender Executive Council to evaluate Iglesias’ readiness for gender-affirming surgery, the first time the bureau had ever been mandated to do so by judicial order. The council is a group of senior-level administrators that include two psychiatrists, a psychologist and a pharmacist, according to court records.\n\nFor weeks the council said it would set up a surgical consult but ultimately referred Iglesias to a surgeon unable to perform the necessary vaginoplasty, a surgery in which a vagina is constructed. Subsequent consultations with other surgeons then fell through.\n\nThe judge’s latest order, issued Monday, directs the bureau to file weekly reports detailing its search for a qualified physician who can conduct the procedure before Iglesias’ scheduled release from federal custody in December 2022.\n\nA Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman said the bureau \"does not comment on pending litigation or matters subject to legal proceedings, nor do we comment on the conditions of confinement for any individual or group of inmates.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by the ACLU, Iglesias, 47, said she hoped the order meant she would “finally get the care I need to live my life fully as the woman I am.”\n\n“(The bureau) has denied me gender-affirming surgery for years and keeps raising new excuses and putting new obstacles in my way,” she said. “I am grateful that the court recognized the urgency of my case.”\n\nA history of resistance\n\nGabriel Arkles, senior counsel for the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the federal government, along with numerous states, has long resisted providing necessary surgical care for transgender inmates.\n\n“Everyone in custody has a right to the health care they need,” Arkles said. “It is unconstitutional and immoral to withhold healthcare because of someone’s gender or because the care they need is stigmatized.”\n\nAn estimated 1,200 transgender individuals are in the federal prison system, or about 0.7% of the overall inmate population of about 156,000.\n\nIglesias, previously housed at a federal prison facility for women in Fort Worth, Texas, is now an inmate at a residential reentry facility in Miami. She pleaded guilty in 2005 to sending an envelope to British officials that she falsely claimed contained anthrax.\n\nAt the time, she was in a federal prison and listed the detention center as the return address.\n\n\"No threat was carried out in any way,\" wrote her public defender, Kathleen Williams, in asking for a more lenient sentence. She noted Iglesias' history of bipolar disorder and the crime's consistency with Iglesias' decade-long history of sending such letters.\n\nIglesias ultimately received a 20-year sentence. She has been in the federal prison system since 1994, where until recently she was housed mostly in men’s facilities, subject to physical and sexual abuse. According to court documents, she experienced gender dysphoria so extreme that she considered self-castration and was placed under suicide watch numerous times.\n\n\"She is at risk for suicide, and her psychological condition will continue to deteriorate,\" the judge wrote in her order.\n\nGender dysphoria is a medical condition marked by mental distress brought on by an incongruity between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth, which can cause anxiety and depression if left untreated. Not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and for those who do, surgery isn’t always necessary.\n\nAdvocates note that treatment options are developed over a years-long process involving patients, parents, physicians and mental health professionals.\n\nProtocols for transgender care have been set by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and endorsed by groups such as the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Family Physicians and World Health Organization.\n\nThose guidelines call for individuals to live in their identified gender role for at least one continuous year before proceeding with surgery, a procedure that should be supported by their primary care provider with referrals from two mental health professionals.\n\n'We still have a long way to go'\n\nIglesias did not receive hormone therapy until 2015 and by the following year had informed prison health officials that she wanted gender confirmation surgery, court documents said. She requested transfer to a women’s prison facility, both to fit her identity and because of harassment from male prisoners.\n\nEventually, the ACLU took on her case and in May 2021, she became one of the few transgender inmates ever moved to a federal prison aligned with their gender identity.\n\nBlecher-Cohen said he hoped that the judge’s order finally compels the prisons bureau to provide Iglesias with the care she needs.\n\n“The court’s order makes clear that she needs gender-affirming surgery now and that BOP cannot justify its failure to provide this medically necessary care,” he said. “We hope this landmark decision will help secure long overdue healthcare for Cristina—and for the many other transgender people in federal custody.”\n\nRangel, of the National Center for Transgender Equality, noted that the prisons bureau recently updated guidelines governing management of transgender inmates to streamline identification, tracking and placement of those individuals.\n\n“We’re in a place now where the federal government is catching up,” Rangel said. “There’s some movement, but we still have a long way to go to make sure that trans folks receive the care that they need.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/31/lori-vallow-daybell-sentencing-live-stream/70497257007/", "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell sentencing live stream: Idaho woman facing ...", "text": "For the latest updates on Lori Vallow Daybell's sentencing, follow along here.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell is set for sentencing in the murders of her two youngest children and her husband's former wife.\n\nIn a case that has garnered widespread notoriety around the world, a seven-man and five-woman Idaho jury found Vallow Daybell guilty after deliberating for seven hours following a five-week trial.\n\nThe verdict came nearly three years after the bodies of Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16, were discovered by authorities in Vallow Daybell's husband's backyard near a \"pet cemetery.\"\n\nVallow Daybell was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder, three counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception.\n\n'CRUEL CAMPAIGN OF TERROR':Mother who killed two children to be sentenced\n\nKay Woodcock, JJ Vallow's grandmother, said the family \"absolutely\" wants Vallow Daybell to get a life sentence without parole.

Now he's going to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPatrick Giblin was like the American version of the “Tinder Swindler” – but without the private jets.\n\nHe wooed women with stories about his respectable family – his father was a judge, he said – and beachfront property in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he said he worked in the casino industry, according to a federal criminal complaint. He told them he was ready to settle down and was more interested in a woman’s inner beauty than her outward appearance.\n\nHe vowed that distance was not an issue because he had access to discount flights and was even ready to move to a woman’s city to further their romance.\n\nBut federal officials say those were all lies, concocted to swindle women looking for love through dating sites. A review of plea agreements and federal complaints show that Giblin conned at least 100 women over two decades, coaxing them out of more than $250,000 with false promises followed by requests for short-term loans that were never repaid.\n\n“He preyed on vulnerabilities, promising to end the loneliness of a woman who had recently ended a long-term relationship or soothing someone who recently suffered the death of a loved one,” said a report by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. “Giblin would convince these women that he was willing to relocate to their locales but needed money wired to do so.”\n\nDespite convictions and serving prison time, he continued to defraud women, even after he was caught and twice escaped from federal custody.\n\nProsecutors say Giblin even scammed women from prison while he was serving time on similar charges, and after he became a fugitive for failing to show up at a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nBut his schemes may finally be over. On Wednesday a federal judge sentenced Giblin to 66 months in prison for escaping from federal custody and one count of wire fraud for engaging in a scheme to defraud women over telephone dating services.\n\nGiblin’s scams date as far back as the early 2000s, authorities said – back when he was in his thirties, and long before Tinder, Bumble and other dating apps. He’s now 58.\n\nOn Lavalife, QuestChat and other dating services, Giblin went by “Pat,” a seemingly charismatic man who assured women that their weight, height and other physical features were not an issue, according to the federal criminal complaint. The complaint said he created numerous accounts in his name on dating sites in the United States and Canada.\n\nProsecutors say he’d message women on the sites, tell them he was seeking a long-term relationship with a “real, true, genuine woman,” and exchange phone numbers.\n\nGiblin would then build a rapport with the women over long phone conversations before he started asking them for money, court documents said. He gave them various excuses for financial emergencies, including that his car broke down or that he needed funds to free up winnings from a gambling tournament, court documents said.\n\nProsecutors say Patrick Giblin continued to scam women from this federal prison in Estill, South Carolina. Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nHis scams predated Venmo, Zelle and other payment apps, so he asked the women to wire him cash – usually several hundred dollars at a time – through MoneyGram or Western Union. Some of the women didn’t know how to use the wire services, but he’d talk them through the process, federal court documents said.\n\nProsecutors say Giblin targeted vulnerable women, including widows, women with physical disabilities and single mothers – including at least one who had recently lost a child.\n\n“Giblin went after the lonely, and broken hearted. Figured out their soft spots and attacked those when he didn’t get his money,” Kathy Waters, executive director of Advocating Against Romance Scammers, told CNN. “The victims are not only abused financially, but emotionally and psychologically as well. He is a master manipulator who has scammed an unknown amount of people, since some never come forward.”\n\nGiblin’s public defender, Lori Koch, declined to comment when reached by CNN.\n\nHe was first arrested in 2005 for scamming a woman in Ohio\n\nGiblin’s scams were first exposed after he was charged with one count of extortion in New Jersey for allegedly scamming a woman in Ohio. That was in March 2005.\n\nAfter his arrest, the FBI said he’d used the same telephone dating services to con women nationwide for five years prior to that, court documents show.\n\nAt the time, Giblin admitted that over a five-year period he had victimized more than 80 women, according to a federal report. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 115 months in prison.\n\nBut that was just the beginning.\n\nWaters believes his number of victims is likely much higher because Giblin continued defrauding women on and off until 2021, and some victims of romance scammers are too embarrassed to come forward.\n\n“The amount of romance scam victims Giblin violated in the US over the years is a number we’ve never seen tied to one scammer,” Waters said. “Not reporting the crime is common for those who have been romance scammed. Often times scrutiny goes along with reporting, which leads to shame and embarrassment.”\n\nTo avoid getting the women mixed up, Giblin kept detailed notes of his activity on the dating services, including names of the victims, their physical descriptions, what they did for a living and the type of man they were looking for, according to the criminal complaint. The FBI interviewed numerous women who disclosed that they’d wired him money.\n\nAs part of a plea deal, Giblin admitted that he’d stolen more than $200,000 from women over the years. In April 2007, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to more than nine years in prison.\n\nHe was sent to a federal prison in Greenville, Illinois. But his criminal activity didn’t stop.\n\nHe escaped from federal custody in 2012\n\nIn late 2012 federal officials placed Giblin in a residential reentry program in Philadelphia. There, he was given a day pass to find a job in Atlantic City, but he never returned and became a fugitive, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA few weeks later, federal authorities found him in an Atlantic City hotel, gambling away funds from women he’d scammed from telephone dating services while on the lam, according to court documents. He’d checked into the hotel under an alias, “Michael Patrick.”\n\nA federal agent asked Giblin where he got the $711 in his possession and if he’d received money from women, and he responded, “there’s one chick I have been f**king around with.”\n\nBut a search of his hotel room revealed there was more than one woman.\n\nInvestigators recovered a cellphone, money transfer receipts and notebooks containing a treasure trove of information, including physical descriptions, interests and hobbies of women he interacted with on dating sites while he was on the lam. The women were from all over the country, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Carolina, New York and Ohio.\n\nIn his notes about one woman, Giblin wrote, “has a savings Account. Home is paid for not a golddigger,” federal documents said. He pleaded guilty to escape charges and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nIn December 2013 he was freed from prison again, this time to start supervised release in New Jersey, federal documents said. As a condition his release, Giblin was to notify his probation officer of any plans to leave the state, but a federal agent later arrested him at a hotel in Colonie, New York.\n\nWhile in New York, Giblin used dating sites to meet and defraud more than 10 women of between $15,000 and $40,000, court documents said.\n\nEight years later, he escaped again\n\nGiblin was convicted and sentenced in August 2017 to five years in prison and ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in restitution. But he continued to scam women while incarcerated at federal prisons in Estill, South Carolina, and in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, court records said.\n\nIn July 2020, he was approved to be transferred from the prison in Lewisburg to a residential reentry center in Newark. Federal officials say they escorted him onto a plane at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Giblin’s itinerary included a layover in Charlotte. He never emerged in Newark.\n\nWhile on the run, Giblin posted messages on telephone dating services and continued scamming and receiving money from women, federal documents said. Prosecutors say that between 2019 and 2021 he defrauded about a dozen women out of more than $37,000.\n\nHe was arrested in March of 2021 in Atlantic City and pleaded guilty in July this year to wire fraud and escaping from federal custody. In addition to his sentence this week of 66 months in prison, Giblin was given three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $23,428.\n\nWaters, the advocate for romance scam victims, said she doesn’t think the sentence was harsh enough considering the breadth of Giblin’s crimes – and just gives him time to plan more ways to scam women.\n\n“Unfortunately the counts didn’t include every life he caused harm to,” she told CNN. “It takes years to heal emotionally, psychologically and financially from these scammers.”", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/09/20/documentary-film-prison-sentence-cindy-shank-rudy-valdez/1344770002/", "title": "'The Sentence' reveals who really pays when mom goes to prison", "text": "Cindy Shank was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Her three daughters were sentenced to 15 years without a mother. Her husband lost a wife.\n\nCindy missed bedtime stories and kissing boo-boos, carving pumpkins, Easter egg hunts, birthday parties and Christmas mornings. She missed 4-year-old Autumn's first dance recital, baby Annalis' first steps, and 2-year-old Ava's first day of school.\n\nHer marriage to Adam Shank was torn to shreds.\n\nThe fallout from Cindy Shank's 2008 sentencing on drug conspiracy charges was wide-reaching. It changed the trajectory of the life of the woman who went to prison that day as well as the lives of everyone who loved her.\n\nAll of it is captured in a film directed by her brother Rudy Valdez, who grew up in Lansing and set out to document the lives of Cindy's children so his sister would one day be able to see what she missed while she was serving time.\n\n\"I wanted Cindy to be able to watch them live,\" Valdez said. \"She was going to get pictures. She was going to get phone calls, but I needed her to see them run and play and laugh and fight and scream. I wanted to one day be able to say to her, 'Look, I know it's not the same, but here are your girls growing up.' I wanted her to be able to watch that.\"\n\nAs Valdez recorded snippets from a decade of their lives, he realized he had more than just home videos for his sister and her family. Those segments came together in a way that could shine a light on an injustice within the American judicial system, the impact of mandatory minimum sentencing in the decades-long war on drugs.\n\n\"It's 15 years on paper, but it's a life sentence,\" Valdez said. \"It's changing everyone's life.\"\n\nIn the process, Valdez quit his teaching job to become a filmmaker and his older sister's most vocal advocate, pushing for appeals and lobbying anyone and everyone who might be able to negotiate an early release.\n\n\"I dove headfirst into documentary,\" he said. \"I quickly realized what a powerful tool documentary could be if done right, and I wanted to do it right.\"\n\nHis film, \"The Sentence,\" debuted at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, winning the documentary audience award. It won best nonfiction film by a first-time director at the Traverse City Film Festival and it's showing as part of the Freep Film Festival's monthly screening series later this week — at 7 p.m. Friday at Eastern High School in Lansing and 11:30 a.m. Saturday at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Its broadcast premiere is set for 8 p.m. Oct. 15 on HBO.\n\nVadez is now on an unusual whirlwind for a first-time director: everything from the Sundance win, a July screening on Capitol Hill attended by members of Congress, and a big publicity campaign connected to broadcast on HBO, a prestigious home for documentaries. \"The Sentence\" also is making an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run next month.\n\n\"It's been such an amazing journey in a lot of ways,\" Valdez said. \"Some of the choices that were made with the film that I think were bold choices are resonating.\"\n\nKnock on the door\n\nCindy thought her trouble with the law was behind her.\n\nSix years earlier, Cindy's boyfriend was Alex Humphry, a Lansing drug dealer who was fatally shot in May 2002. (Investigators never found his killer.) When police searched the home Humphry shared with Cindy, they discovered cocaine, marijuana, guns and other evidence. At the time, it was reported to be the biggest drug bust in Lansing's history.\n\nCindy said her boyfriend wasn't into drugs when she met him in the late '90s. But Humphry quickly spiraled into that life, and she said, became abusive and threatened her. She testified that she was afraid to leave him and told investigators she wasn't involved in his drug operation.\n\nSoon after Humphry died, Cindy faced state charges in connection with Humphry's drug enterprise. But those charges were later dismissed.\n\nCindy had a second chance, and she made the most of it.\n\nShe worked at a Lansing-area restaurant and fell in love with Adam Shank. Soon after, they got married. A daughter, Autumn, was born in November 2003. Another brown-eyed girl, Ava, arrived in January 2006.\n\nThen came the predawn knock on the door in 2007 that disrupted their happily-ever-after.\n\nThe federal government brought charges against Cindy and several others as coconspirators in Humphry's drug enterprise.\n\n\"I was pregnant when they arrested me and I didn’t know,\" Cindy said.\n\nShe went to trial in October 2007 and was convicted on four counts. The Shanks negotiated with the court to delay her sentencing hearing until after she delivered their third child, Annalis, right before Christmas in 2007. Cindy doted on her babies during that precious time.\n\n\"I was preparing Autumn,\" Cindy said. \"Ava was only 2. She didn’t really have a concept of what was going on. I was just cuddling her and taking care of her as much as possible, but Autumn was very talkative and very vocal and she was very aware of what was going on.\n\n\"So that last month and a half, I was telling her, you know. I was preparing her at night. ... I didn’t want to just be gone unexpectedly. ... So we would have these talks at night before bed.\n\n\"Every night, she’d ask, 'Is it tomorrow, Mommy? Is it tomorrow?' And I’d say, 'Not tomorrow.' Well, the last night I had to say, 'Yes, it’s tomorrow,' \" Cindy said as tears spilled onto her cheeks. \"We just … we really held each other and cried for a few hours. She still didn’t get it. She just didn’t understand.\"\n\nThe next day, while her girls played with her mother outside the courtroom, Cindy was asked to remove her wedding rings and was taken away in handcuffs.\n\nThe girlfriend problem\n\n\"I went away Feb. 29, 2008,\" Cindy said.\n\nAlthough the prosecutor asked for an 89-year prison sentence, U.S. District Judge Robert Holmes Bell sentenced her to 15 years — the mandatory minimum sentence — in her case.\n\n\"I broke down,\" Cindy said. \"They walked me out (of the courtroom), and I turned back. We locked eyes, and Adam is just falling to his knees. And … I was gone. ... I was walked right back to a cell and thrown through a jail door. Then it started, the very horrible ride.\"\n\nWhat happened to Cindy was happening to thousands of other women around the country. In legal circles, it was called \"the girlfriend problem,\" a side effect in the war on drugs whereby women were convicted on conspiracy charges in connection with the crimes of their husbands or boyfriends. In many cases, they didn't know about the illegal activity or played low-level roles such as counting money or answering the door or the phone at a home where deals were taking place.\n\n\"I didn't get it,\" Valdez said of the system that led to the mass incarceration of women like Cindy, especially women of color. \"That's what drove everything was the thought of who was benefiting. Who does this benefit in any way?\n\n\"What you cannot deny is that Cindy is not a detriment to society. She is somebody who can still continue to contribute and she is not a special case. If you don't care about the heart, at least care about the finance. In that way, we are all connected to this. We need to understand and be smarter about the rhetoric about being soft on crime or hard on crime. It shouldn't take having a loved one sent away to understand that we're all affected by it.\"\n\nCindy was taken to a minimum-security federal women's prison camp in Pekin, Illinois. Valdez filmed what he could of Adam and Cindy's daughters — traveling from Brooklyn, New York, where he lived at the time, to Michigan to see them.\n\n\"When I initially went in, I really thought there was a mistake,\" Cindy said. \"Me and my brother talk about this all the time. ... I'm on the inside thinking there's something wrong, they're going to get me out. And he's on the outside saying like, 'Yeah, I've just got to figure out what went wrong. There's a mistake somewhere.' But as he's speaking to attorneys, he's realizing that no, there's no mistake at all. And I'm on the inside, speaking to all these women and I'm learning that their stories are exactly like mine. ... We were coming to the realization at the same time, but he's out there and I'm in here.\n\n\"He comes to visit and we're both just like, they don't think they made a mistake. I'm really going to be stuck here. That's when the fight started and we knew we were going to have to fight to get me out.\"\n\nMothering, 15 minutes at a time\n\nCindy's mother, Armida Mireles, helped Adam care for the girls. Adam's parents and Valdez pitched in, too.\n\n\"Once she went away, there was this insurmountable mountain that we had to try and scale in a lot of ways with time, with the legal fight, with making sure those girls were connected to Cindy,\" Valdez said. \"There were so many things that seemed like monumental tasks.\"\n\nCindy's father spent his free time collecting scrap metal so he could send Cindy $40 a week. The money, he knew, would be used to pay for phone calls home so she could be a mother in 15-minute increments from a telephone hundreds of miles away.\n\n\"He never missed a week,\" Cindy said. \"That was a blessing because with that money I was able to call the girls regularly and have that constant communication with them. Along with calling them, I used that money for my commissary as well. For food, and for pajamas or socks or deodorant, toothpaste. ... You've got to buy your own laundry soap. ... They don't offer you any of that.\"\n\nFor about $90 a month, Cindy was allotted 300 minutes of phone calls — that's 20 calls of 15 minutes each.\n\nBecause there were three daughters, \"if we all wanted to talk during the phone call, we got 5 minutes each,\" Autumn said.\n\nCindy laughed, adding: \"And gosh forbid any of them went one minute over, the other one would be like, 'That’s my minute!' \"\n\nAdam and Cindy's mom would drive the girls 5½ hours each way to visit her in Illinois once every six weeks.\n\n\"They did that pretty much for the first three years,\" Cindy said. \"Pretty regularly, I was able to see the girls, which was really important because they were so young.\"\n\nCindy would try to make the most of those visits, dancing and singing Taylor Swift songs with the girls and using their imaginations to think about things outside the prison walls. At Halloween one year, Cindy used toilet paper to make them princess dresses and tiaras so they could trick-or-treat among the other prisoners visiting their families.\n\nCindy used some of the money her father sent her to buy yarn to make blankets and handbags, hats, scarves and mittens.\n\n\"I still have the blanket you made me,\" Annalis said.\n\nCindy smiled.\n\n\"I couldn’t wrap my arms around them, but they could wrap this blanket I made around them,\" Cindy said. \"I couldn’t do much of anything for them, but I could keep Annalis’ little head warm or her hands warm. You know, little things like that.\"\n\nEach year, Valdez would help his sister get the girls special Christmas gifts from their mother.\n\n\"I would send him a card for each of them, and then he would buy them presents and attach them to the card and send them from me to them,\" Cindy said. \"He did little things, anything, to keep us connected.\"\n\nHe did something else, too.\n\n\"He was trying to tell my story, our story and trying to share it in the hopes that somebody could help one day or that a door would open,\" Cindy said. \"He was playing the long game, trying to talk to as many people and see what shakes, see what falls out of the tree, basically. ... He would speak to any school, to any conference. He would go. He is very selfless. He is a good brother and a good uncle. He was a good man to these girls.\"\n\nValdez caught what he could through the lens of his camera, capturing the long car rides to visit her, heartbreaking phone conversations, and the hard goodbyes.\n\nCindy spent three years in Pekin, Illinois, before she was transferred to a prison camp in Coleman, Florida.\n\nThere, her visits with the girls were reduced to once a year. The daughters were older and couldn't miss school to visit their mom in Florida with any regularity. It was too far away, and too expensive to travel.\n\n\"It’s the hotels and travel expenses and all that,\" Adam said. Their marriage fell apart.\n\n\"That’s one of the things that didn’t survive all this was our marriage,\" Cindy said. \"We were divorced, I think, four years into the sentence. Our friendship still remains.\"\n\nValdez kept up the fight to free Cindy. There were appeals to overturn the conviction and pleas for clemency, but years passed and nothing changed Cindy's situation. Still, Valdez remains thankful to Adam for all he did to support his sister even after the divorce was finalized.\n\nThree years later, Cindy was moved again. This time, to a federal prison camp in Lexington, Kentucky. Closer to her family, it meant more opportunities to see the people she loved.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT: Stop reading here if you don't want to know what happens in the film.)\n\nThen came an unexpected phone call in 2016.\n\n\"Nobody calls you while you’re in prison, OK,\" Cindy said. \"So I thought, who’s calling me?\"\n\nIt was her lawyer. Cindy wondered whether there was news on the family's latest appeal for clemency.\n\n\"I instantly just held my breath,\" Cindy said. \"I knew this was the moment. Yes or no. This was the yes or no moment.\n\n\"She just said, 'I’m so happy to tell you ...' and that’s all she got out because I just started screaming. ... I could hear her yelling over my screams that I got clemency. And I just fell to my knees, and I’m literally screaming.\"\n\nTwo days before Christmas 2016, Cindy walked through the door of her mother's house where the girls were waiting with Adam and her siblings and her dad for the surprise of a lifetime.\n\n\"It has been this crazy journey,\" Valdez said. \"For better or worse, we're are on the other side of it. Cindy is out, and we're starting a new fight now. It's a different fight. ... I think the ramifications of what has happened are, you know, long-lasting. We don't even know yet. We may have many years yet on this journey.\n\n\"It's not a happy ending, per se. It's not, like 'oh, she got clemency and everything is OK.' It's far from that.\n\n\"In a weird way, clemency is wonderful and we're so happy to have Cindy home. But in her being granted clemency, there was another voice in the back of my head saying, 'So, they admit something was wrong. Well, why did this have to happen?' And then you think of the thousands and thousands of people who are still there who are just as deserving as Cindy. And they're still there for who knows how long. There's no happy ending to this when you think of the bigger picture, especially.\"\n\nFor Cindy, there's joy in being able to hug her daughters and begin to rebuild her life. But there's guilt, too, in knowing many of the women who became her friends in prison might not get the same opportunity she did.\n\n\"I want people to know that people who are behind bars aren’t horrible people,\" she said. \"They’re somebody’s mother, daughter, sister, wife.\n\n\"They have people who love them. And there are good people there, too. ... I left behind a lot of deserving women who deserve to be home with their children just as much as I do.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nTwo screenings of \"The Sentence,\" which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival this year, are being presented later this week as part of the Freep Film Festival monthly screening series.\n\nBoth showings will include appearances by Rudy Valdez and members of his family for post-film Q&As.\n\nThe first screening is 7 p.m. Friday, Eastern High School, Lansing. The post-film conversation will be led by Andy Callis, Valdez's former theater instructor at Lansing Community College. This screening is free, but reservation is required at freepfilmfestival.com.\n\nThe second is set for 11:30 a.m. Saturday in the Marvin and Betty Danto Lecture Hall, Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit. Tickets for this screening are $10, and can be purchased at the DIA website, box office or through a link at freepfilmfestival.com.\n\nThe screenings are being presented by Freep Film Festival in partnership with Lansing School District, Lansing Public Media Center, the ACLU of Michigan, the Detroit Institute of Arts and HBO Documentary Films.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2022/08/15/death-row-inmate-richard-glossip-wife-says-he-used-her/65402902007/", "title": "First prison wife of death row inmate Richard Glossip says he used her", "text": "In a sworn statement sent to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, the first prison wife of death row inmate Richard Glossip wrote that she feels used and \"did not get anything out of the relationship.\"\n\n\"Glossip, on the other hand, got exactly what he wanted, which was financing for himself while in prison,\" Leigha Joy Jurasik stated in the affidavit signed Wednesday in New Jersey.\n\nTheir wedding in September 2018 at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester became international news. The marriage was dissolved without fanfare in February 2021.\n\nShe revealed in the affidavit that she spent $7,000 on Glossip and another $1,000 on other death row inmates at his request. \"He only thought of himself,\" she wrote. \"Glossip was controlling and manipulative and used me for financial gain.\"\n\nMore:'When they stop serving last meals, we'll stop reporting it.' Oklahoma death row custom stirs debate\n\nDeath row inmate Richard Glossip to appear before Parole Board next week for clemency hearing\n\nGlossip, 59, is set to be executed Sept. 22 for the murder of his boss, Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board meets Aug. 23 to decide whether to recommend Glossip for clemency. He claims he is innocent.\n\nThat claim has received widespread support, most recently from conservative pro-death penalty legislators in Oklahoma. One outspoken supporter, state Rep. Kevin McDugle, R-Broken Arrow, has vowed to fight to abolish the death penalty in the state if Glossip is executed.\n\nAttorney General John O'Connor and his assistants included affidavits from Jurasik and another woman, along with graphic crime scene photos, in their packet to the parole board.\n\n\"Glossip does not ask for mercy; he asks for vindication,\" the state attorneys wrote. \"The media might ignore portions of the evidence. Politicians might question the reliability of the outcome. Public opinion might claim certain witnesses cannot be believed. But for this Board, the facts of this case cannot be changed.\n\n\"Glossip orchestrated the murder of Barry Van Treese. A jury sentenced him to death. This Board must see that justice is done.\"\n\nThe victim was found beaten to death in Room 102 of his motel the Best Budget Inn on Jan. 7. 1997. Van Treese was 54 and lived in Lawton.\n\nA motel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, confessed to killing the owner with a baseball bat. He said Glossip pressured him into doing it and offered him $10,000 as payment.\n\nSneed also said Glossip was worried about being fired when Van Treese discovered motel rooms had not been remodeled.\n\nRichard Glossip's defenders claim he is an innocent victim of a faulty justice system\n\nGlossip was first sent to death row after being convicted in 1998. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ordered a new murder trial because his defense attorney failed to represent him adequately. He was sent to death row again after a 2004 retrial.\n\nHis attorneys contend the maintenance man killed the motel owner during a botched robbery for drug money and lied about Glossip to avoid the death penalty. They claim Sneed, a meth addict, made admissions in jail and later in prison about framing Glossip.\n\nOne prisoner reported Sneed openly bragged multiple times about the deal he had made to save his life and that Glossip had not done anything, the attorneys said. Sneed, now 44, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n\"Richard Glossip is an innocent man who has been the victim of a massive breakdown in the justice system that would have been disturbing had it occurred even in a minor case.\" his attorneys told the Pardon and Parole Board in their packet.\n\n\"Police are supposed to investigate cases objectively and thoroughly rather than jumping to conclusions and resting on their first theory,\" Glossip's attorneys wrote. \"The State is supposed to provide competent lawyers to zealously represent indigent defendants’ interests, which includes investigating the case and testing the prosecution’s evidence.Prosecutors are supposed to ensure that the evidence they present is reliable, to safeguard the evidence in the case rather than destroying it, and to proceed with a prosecution only when it is consistent with justice.\n\n\"None of these things happened in this case.\"\n\nGlossip's ex-wife claims she was threatened after their relationship was over\n\nIn her affidavit, Jurasik wrote that she first wrote Glossip in July 2017 after seeing a documentary about his case. State attorneys have criticized the documentary, \"Killing Richard Glossip,\" as obviously slanted in his favor and inaccurate.\n\n\"At the time, I was 20 years old and Glossip was 54,\" she wrote. \"He told me he loved me during one of our first few phone calls with each other, and he started talking about marriage and a wedding very early on. During those conversations, Glossip told me he would be getting out of prison soon.\"\n\nShe wrote that Glossip would throw temper tantrums during phone calls and at times threaten to even kill himself to get her to give in to \"whatever demand he was making.\"\n\nJurasik, now 25, also wrote that he stirred up animosity toward her \"among his online following\" after their relationship ended. \"My mother and I received death threats from some of them. Glossip also sent me a letter stating that I was going to jail and that police were going to investigate me.\"\n\nFormer Glossip supporter now says she believes he is guilty\n\nAlso calling Glossip manipulative was Melissa Ratliff who first sent him a post card of support in 2015 after seeing an episode on the TV show, \"Dr. Phil,\" about his innocence claim.\n\n\"Glossip knew I was passionate about issues of innocence and the death penalty and took full advantage of that,\" Ratliff wrote in an affidavit signed Aug. 4 in West Virginia.\n\nShe wrote they reconnected in 2020 and spoke up to seven times a day by phone for six months. She wrote she put thousands of dollars in the accounts of Glossip and other death row inmates at his request.\n\n\"Once in 2020, I expressed some concern about the amount of money that I was sending Glossip,\" she wrote. \"Glossip made ugly comments to me, suggesting that I need not worry whether he had anything to eat. I, of course, wanted him to eat, so I kept sending money.\"\n\nShe wrote she ended the relationship in January 2021 and now believes Glossip is guilty. She wrote he sent her a letter in May 2021 threatening to destroy her career and have her investigated by the Department of Corrections.\n\n\"There is a considerable amount of shame and embarrassment I feel for the time I spent dedicated to Glossip,\" she wrote. \"I am happy to say I am no longer controlled by his tactics.\"\n\nGlossip in March married another woman who is opposed to the death penalty\n\nGlossip married again in prison in March. His new bride is Lea Rodger, a law student from Florida and anti-death penalty advocate.\n\n“For Rich, surviving three execution attempts, possibly facing a fourth, the one thing he’s really taken away from that is: Don’t take anything for granted ... really live in the moment,” Rodger told The Associated Press.\n\nGlossip's attorneys also are challenging his conviction again at the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. They have told the court they have new evidence of his innocence.\n\nThe number of legislators calling for an evidentiary hearing has grown to 62.\n\nAmong the new evidence is a 2007 handwritten letter from Sneed to his defense attorney. \"It was a mistake,\" he wrote. \"Reliving this.\"\n\nHe also wrote there were a lot of things \"eating at me\" and some things \"I need to clean up.\"\n\nIn a news release last week, McDugle called the letter \"compelling new evidence that strongly supports what we heard, that Sneed wanted to recant his statement implicating Richard Glossip and his attorney shut him down.\"\n\nIn a response to Sneed's letter, Gina Walker, then an Oklahoma County assistant public defender, wrote that she knew it was very hard for him to testify at the second trial. Walker, who is now dead, also wrote she knew Glossip's lawyers \"tried to talk you out of it.\"\n\n\"Had you refused, you would most likely be on death row right now,\" she wrote. \"I hope he has not or his lawyers have not tried to make you feel responsible for the outcome of his case and his decisions.\"\n\nAttorneys for the state dispute the letter is proof Sneed considered recanting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2020/08/10/art-schlichterrsquos-sad-tragic-life-behind-bars/42197763/", "title": "Art Schlichter's 'sad, tragic' life behind bars", "text": "Dana Hunsinger Benbow Indianapolis Star\n\nArt Schlichter sometimes shakes uncontrollably and he sometimes forgets. What was that first bet he ever placed? What did it feel like to be a Heisman Trophy candidate at Ohio State? Which year was it that NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle banned him from the league?\n\nHe has tremors that come and go.\n\nWhat a peculiar feeling this is compared to being that invincible quarterback. That guy who placed his first bet with some buddies and felt ecstasy he could never describe no matter how hard he tried.\n\nThe only way to capture the high was to do it again. And again and again.\n\nGet the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our morning, afternoon and evening newsletters\n\nSchlichter is 60 and he is a far cry from that rugged, dark-haired, charismatic man whom one of his mentors says was so electric he could have been the governor of Ohio.\n\nHe wears thin, wrinkled prison garb. He frets about the prison air being filled with COVID-19. And he cannot for the life of him fill in all the blanks.\n\nHe has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and dementia.\n\nIn a series of emails to The Indianapolis Star as his release from a federal prison in Colorado approached, he was evasive about his life of compulsive gambling and financial fraud that hurt so many.\n\nFor three months, he never answered questions about his addiction. He talked about feeling bad for hurting people close to him. He talked about feeling like a victim himself.\n\nHe said he wanted to tell his story of how he has been treated unfairly by the courts and prosecutors, how maybe he could help others suffering from a gambling addiction.\n\n\"i was glad to hear back from you...i thought you read my emails and thought \"this guys(sic) is nuts\" and just lost interest\"\n\nAbout how it is time he be released after serving yet another long sentence.\n\n\"my story now consists of being unfairly treated and being coerced into taking a plea bargain and the prosecutor in Columbus broke the plea agreement i had with him and the judge and it has affected my life each and everyday since...i should have been home 2 years ago...i have never spoken about this before on the record...i should have along time ago but felt like it would hurt me more in the long run but i was wrong not to talk about...\"\n\nHow if this article is to be written, he has some conditions. No naming his daughters or his mother's location. No talking to this person or that person. But definitely talk to this person and that person. (IndyStar did not accept the conditions.)\n\nThey will help fill in the gaps of the things he has forgotten.\n\nBut Schlichter hasn't forgotten — at least not one thing.\n\nSchlichter, according to prison records, has not forgotten how to gamble.\n\n'Past the point of rehabilitation'\n\nSchlichter is in the Federal Correctional Institute in Florence, Colorado, on federal fraud charges for a massive ticket scheme that bilked millions of dollars from his victims. He promised college and NFL game tickets, including tickets to the Super Bowl, to buyers. He never delivered the tickets despite being paid for them.\n\nIn May 2012, Schlichter was sentenced to nearly 11 years in Florence and 10 years in an Ohio penitentiary. The two sentences were to be served concurrently.\n\nFrom inside the walls of prison just months before his scheduled Aug. 18 release, even as he was corresponding with IndyStar, Schlichter was having women outside the prison place bets for him, says Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien.\n\nSchlichter also was betting inside prison with other inmates, O'Brien said. Prison officials found out through emails and phone calls that Schlichter was gambling from inside. He was banned from email for 90 days in March because of his gambling, according to prison records.\n\nAs he was set to finish serving his 11 year-sentence in federal prison (which he completed in just more than eight years), Schlichter's attorney, Stephen Palmer, filed a motion that his remaining state time — about nine months — should be waived. Palmer said last month that his client suffers from health problems and deserves to be released.\n\n\"We can only take so much pounds of flesh out of one human,\" Palmer said. \"He did his crimes; he's served his time. Time to let him out.\"\n\nO'Brien said outside a Columbus courtroom on Wednesday that Schlichter \"is a career criminal engaged in fraud as a career. He just cannot help himself.\"\n\nSchlichter just months ago had another ticket scheme going in prison, O'Brien said. He persuaded an inmate's family member that he had Super Bowl tickets and that family member paid Schlichter money for them.\n\n\"Why? I can’t tell you, given his history,\" O'Brien said. \"But from prison, he is convincing another inmate to have their family buy Super Bowl tickets from him.\"\n\nThat witness was in court Wednesday ready to testify, but at the start of the hearing, Palmer withdrew his request for Schlichter's early release. And Schlichter, who was to appear in court via video, did not.\n\nPalmer said afterward that he was certain Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Chris Brown was going to deny the request, which the judge confirmed. Because Schlichter's petition was withdrawn, it can be filed again. If the hearing had gone forward and a judge had denied it, Schlichter would have no chance for an early release.\n\nSchlichter's continued gambling in prison is a major red flag, Judge Brown said Wednesday.\n\nAnd Schlichter will not be free when he is released from federal prison later this month. Instead, he will be transferred to Ohio to serve the remaining nine months of his state sentence in a penitentiary.\n\n\"He is past the point of rehabilitation,\" said Brown. \"To release him now would be to subject the people of Franklin County to further criminal conduct. I have no faith he is going to get out and conduct (himself appropriately).\"\n\nFor now, Schlichter remains prisoner No. 30044-048.\n\nA 'devil Art and the real Art'\n\nThrough the years, Schlichter has been particularly adept at persuading women to help him, said Arnie Wexler, a nationally renowned expert on compulsive gambling who has been a mentor to Schlichter.\n\n\"That’s been his nature all these years. He's always been able to get money from females,\" said Wexler. \"He will con the pants off of anyone. The guy's really smart, but he’s also really sick.\"\n\nThere was Schlichter's public defender in Indianapolis, Linda M. Wagoner, whom he persuaded to sneak a cellphone into jail two decades ago so he could place bets.\n\nWagoner pleaded guilty in December 2000 to a misdemeanor trafficking charge for smuggling the phone into the Marion County Jail. In 2003, the Indiana Supreme Court suspended Wagoner for 90 days and put her on probation for two years after that.\n\n\"I am a basket case, physically, mentally,\" Wagoner said in an IndyStar article. \"I look at myself and think, 'I have been a lawyer for almost 25 years. I have never, ever done anything to get myself in trouble, ever.'\"\n\nYet, for Schlichter, she did.\n\nFor Mitzi Schlichter — now remarried and Mitzi Subrin — her 9-year marriage to Schlichter was \"tumultuous.\" She married Schlichter in 1989 and, at first, had no idea he was gambling. Subrin did not return IndyStar requests for this story. She did detail what it was like to be married to Schlichter in a 1998 IndyStar article.\n\nSchlichter placed bets from a phone he kept stashed in the trunk of the car, she said. When Mitzi went to bed, Schlichter stayed up late tracking scores and his wagers. She sometimes woke to him vomiting. He told her it was the flu, but it was really his nerves.\n\nWhen Art had money riding on a game, his whole body twitched, she said. Around home, cash vanished. \"I would say, 'Art, I had $100 in my purse. Did you take it?'\" Subrin told IndyStar a year after the couple's divorce.\n\nBut one of the incidents in their marriage that most worried and infuriated Subrin happened in 1990 when she was in the hospital to give birth to their daughter. She took her jewelry off and laid it to the side.\n\nSchlichter took her wedding ring, she said, and pawned it for money to gamble. When he went to buy it back, the ring had been sold.\n\nOne of Schlichter's most noted connections to a woman was his scandal with Anita Barney. The widow of a former CEO of Wendy's, Barney was first one of Schlichter's victims.\n\nAfter taking Barney's money, he persuaded her to become his accomplice. Barney stole nearly half a million dollars from friends as Schlichter guided her. She pleaded guilty to two felony counts of theft and did not serve any time.\n\nIn his 2009 book, \"Busted: The Rise and Fall of Art Schlichter,\" Schlichter talks about his mother, Mila, and how awful he was to her, stealing money any chance he could.\n\nIt's as if there are two Art Schlichters, his father, Max Schlichter, told IndyStar three years before his death in 2002. \"A devil Art,\" he said, \"and a real Art.\"\n\nSchlichter was thoughtful in his emails to IndyStar, such as this one on March 26:\n\n\"when i didn't hear from you once again, i thought you weren't interested anymore...are you ok as far as the (coronavirus) is concerned? are you in Indianapolis in lockdown or are you out and about doing stories?\"\n\nBut then IndyStar published a story in July about Schlichter being disciplined in prison for placing bets even as his lawyer was fighting for his release. Days later, July 27, Schlichter cut off contact. A final email came from FCI Florence to IndyStar.\n\nSubject: Inmate: SCHLICHTER, ARTHUR E\n\nThe above-named inmate has chosen to remove your email address from his/her approved contact list and, therefore, can not receive or send messages to your email address.\n\nBut the emails he had previously sent laid out his rationale for his behavior, stemming, he said, from traumas he suffered in his childhood.\n\n'Tragedy in my life'\n\nMarch 15: \"did you read the book i wrote with Jeff shook 11 years ago...it would give you some background on my first 30 years or so...my father committed suicide in 2002...my sister died of a blood clot in 2018...some tragedy in my life for sure.\"\n\nArthur Ernest Schlichter was born to John (Max) and Mila Schlichter on April 25, 1960, with the gift of raw athleticism no matter the sport.\n\nBy 4 years old, he could dribble a basketball, really dribble it, not just bounce it. By junior high, he was the pride of his school basketball team. He once scored 47 of his team's 49 points.\n\nAs a sophomore at Miami Trace High School in Washington Court House, Schlichter was rated the top high school quarterback in the country. His team went 29-0-1. He was an all-state guard in basketball.\n\nBut in his mind, the success didn't translate. Life wasn't all easy for Schlichter. He felt pressure and there were demons.\n\nAnd that, said his late, longtime psychologist, Dr. R. L. Custer, was the root of the compulsive gambling addiction that has shadowed him for life.\n\nAddicts gamble excessively, Custer said, not for pleasure or self-punishment, but to escape pain. In 1980, after year's of Custer pushing for it, the American Psychiatric Association classified compulsive gambling as a psychological disorder.\n\nCuster told Sports Illustrated in March 1986 he had to dig Schlichter's demons out of him.\n\n\"Nobody had ever asked him before if he had had any close calls with death,\" Custer told the magazine. \"Incidents such as these set gamblers up psychologically. It's something unresolved they need relief from.\"\n\nOne of his first traumatic memories, Schlichter writes in his book, was his dad taking him and brother John to Rogers Farm. While Max Schlichter tended to horses and cattle, the two boys played.\n\n\"One day, I ran into the barn to pet the horses and there he was ... one of the hired hands just hanging there in front of my 6-year-old eyes, all his life gone from his body,\" Schlichter wrote.\n\nHe ran out as fast as he could. But as an adult, Schlichter wrote, the image of that man hanging in the barn still haunts him.\n\nAnother tragedy struck when Schlichter was in eighth grade. He and John were trying to remove roofing tar from a floor at their home using gasoline when a spark from an oil burner caused an explosion.\n\nSchlichter's right side, from thigh to shoulder, was severely burned. \"It was torture,\" Max Schlichter told Sports Illustrated. \"They'd give him painkillers, but they never quite took hold. He screamed for me to let him die.\"\n\nBut in the next breath, Schlichter said something else, his dad said.\n\n\"When he was in the hospital, he would always repeat to himself,\" Max Schlichter said. \"'I can play football this fall. I can play football this fall.'\"\n\nFootball, it seemed, was the answer to everything. Until it wasn't.\n\nThe betting begins\n\nWhen he placed his first bet, no one knows. But by the time Schlichter was in high school he was a regular gambler.\n\nHe went to Scioto Downs, a racetrack in Columbus. Mostly, he placed small bets, a few bucks. But his senior year, he took $20 and bet on a long shot and won.The payout was $150.\n\nThere was that feeling.\n\nOnce he was at Ohio State in 1978, now a 6-3, 190-pound starting quarterback for Woody Hayes, Schlichter's visits to Scioto Downs grew more frequent. Each race that ran, he bet more. Soon he was wagering $30 a race. More wins. More losses. More striving for that feeling.\n\nHe switched from horses to games when he was a junior at Ohio State. He began wagering on college basketball. He liked it because he didn't have to go to the track. He could make a phone call.\n\nBy that spring, according to his book, he was thousands of dollars in debt.\n\nFrom there, Schlichter's gambling addiction spiraled out of control. He failed in the NFL after being picked fourth overall in the 1982 NFL draft by the Baltimore Colts. He spent time in nearly 50 different prisons and jails. He broke family members’ hearts. His father killed himself.\n\nAnd in 2020, a 60-year-old Schlichter begged to be released from prison.\n\ndbenbow@indystar.com\n\n@DanaBenbow\n\nListen to the BuckeyeXtra Football podcast:\n\nOmny - https://omny.fm/shows/buckeyextra-podcast/playlists/podcast/embed?style=cover&#38;size=square", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/10"}]}
