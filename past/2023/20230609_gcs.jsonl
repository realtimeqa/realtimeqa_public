There will be more charges. We anticipate dozens of more charges.''\n\nPolice said Crimo fired more than 70 shots from a rooftop Monday, killing seven people and wounding nearly 40 more with a legally purchased assault rifle before fleeing. He was captured that evening after an intense manhunt.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Investigators have interrogated the suspect and reviewed his social media posts but provided no motive for the attack, describing it only as \"random.\"\n\n►Lake County Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli said the gun – “similar to an AR-15” – was legally purchased by Crimo in the Chicago area.\n\nHundreds gather for vigil the day after shooting\n\nHundreds of people congregated in downtown Highland Park Tuesday evening, blocks from the scene of the shooting. Families, neighbors and friends held hands, hugged and cried. Others laughed and smiled as they unexpectedly bumped into loved ones.\n\n“It’s good to face your fear and come back to the scene. There’s something about coming back,” said Elise Dayan, 54, a 21-year resident of Highland Park.\n\nSome exchanged stories of where they were during the parade. Some hung orange ribbons—for gun safety—in the trees. Others placed flowers, prayed and lit candles. Many kids wore Highland Park High School shirts and sweatshirts.\n\n“It feels good to be with other people going through the same thing,” said Highland Park native Lucy Melinger, 19, who lives a block from the scene of the shooting.\n\nMelinger said the gunshots could be heard from her house during Monday's shooting, and that her family at the parade ran back to the house amid the panic.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nSuspect was visited by police twice in 2019 — had knives confiscated\n\nThe man accused of killing seven people and wounding dozens at a Fourth of July parade was the subject of two police visits in 2019, one after he threatened \"to kill everyone'' in the house, police said Tuesday.\n\nCovelli said Crimo III had 16 knives, a dagger and a sword confiscated during that incident in September 2019. Five months earlier, police had responded to a reported suicide attempt by Crimo, according to Covelli.\n\nCrimo, 21, planned the attack for weeks, police said, and was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder. After firing more than 70 shots from a rooftop, Crimo abandoned an assault rifle he had bought legally, blended into the crowd by wearing women's clothes and walked to his mother's home, said Covelli, who revealed a seventh victim died Tuesday.\n\nAnother rifle and three other weapons, also purchased legally, were found in the car Crimo was driving Monday evening when he returned to Illinois after driving to Wisconsin and was spotted by a neighbor who called 911. He was arrested after an intensive manhunt.\n\nSix of seven victims identified, ages 35-88\n\nThe Lake County Coroner's office identified the six people killed Monday in the shooting rampage at Highland Park. A seventh victim died Tuesday, authorities said, but they have not revealed the person's name.\n\nFive of the six identified victims lived in Highland Park. The exception was Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78, who hailed from Morelos, Mexico.\n\nThe other five who died Monday were:\n\nKatherine Goldstein, 64; Irina McCarthy, 35; Kevin McCarthy, 37; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; and Stephen Straus, 88.\n\nThe victims included a dedicated synagogue worker, a grandfather watching Fourth of July festivities from his wheelchair, and the parents of a two-year-old son.\n\nHere's what we know about the victims.\n\nVice President Harris visits Highland Park\n\nVice President Kamala Harris paid an unannounced visit late Tuesday to the site of the violence.\n\nHarris’ motorcade arrived at the shooting site at 7:05 p.m. local time. Children’s bikes, a baby stroller, water coolers, toys and lawn chairs were scattered along the brick sidewalks. Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who were invited to visit by Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, spoke for several minutes to local officials. Nearby residents shouted \"Thank you for coming.\"\n\n\"We have to take this stuff seriously,\" Harris said. \"The whole nation should understand and have a level of empathy to understand that this can happen anywhere, in any peace-loving community. And we should stand together.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Harris called the shooting “a senseless act of gun violence” during remarks to a meeting of the National Education Association in Chicago.\n\n“We need to end this horror,” she said. “We need to stop this violence. And we must protect our communities from the terror of gun violence.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nGrieving at vigil: 'There’s no five-step plan for this'\n\nPearson Lau, a lead pastor at Trinity Grace Church in Highland Park, stood outside his congregation with a 10-foot cross high in the background and spoke to reporters choked up with emotion. He was leading a vigil service one day after a mass shooting killed seven and injured dozens in the affluent Chicago suburb.\n\n“As a Christian, I don’t think we have all the answers in scripture for something like this,” Lau said. “God doesn’t say, ‘Here’s why people do evil things.’ I wish we did. I read in my devotion this morning. It said, ‘God bottles our tears and he recounts our loss.’ The hope that we have is that he’ll bring justice and righteousness to this world one day.''\n\nLau spoke to grieving parishioners for an hour, many of them teary-eyed entering and leaving the church — some processing stories of personal heartache and others still in shock from the trauma endured by a close-knit community.\n\nCharlotte Bank was one attendee filled with mixed emotions in her mourning. Bank told reporters she had seen the shooter, Robert Crimo III, attend services at that church. “(I’m) here to reconcile my own feelings,” she said.\n\nLau said the Fourth of July tragedy illustrates the need for more awareness about the impact of shootings regardless of the community where they take place.\n\n\"I’ve heard a lot of people say this is not the type of thing to happen in Highland Park,'' Lau said. \"But our brothers and sisters on the south side of Chicago, they see this almost every single day. We grow callous to that. Numbers just become numbers.\n\n“The way that I’ve been thinking about it (at the vigil) is to do God’s work and just get out of the way. There’s no five-step plan for (grieving) this.”\n\n– Scott Gleeson\n\nTeenage resident recalls Crimo as someone 'up to no good'\n\nHighland Park resident Martin Brubaker, 18, said he recalls Bobby Crimo coming into the local Jewel Osco supermarket several times with a group of friends, \"high'' and wearing hoodies in the middle of summer.\n\n“When I saw him, I was like, that guy is up to no good,'' Brubaker said. \"It’s not that I thought he was gonna do this. It’s more like I don’t want to talk to that guy.”\n\nCrimo can be seen in a widely circulated Chicago Tribune photo of a Trump rally. The man standing to Crimo’s right in the photo is Peter Christos, 18, according to Deerfield resident Natalie Reed, 18, who attended school with Christos at Glenbrook North.\n\n“He’s very anti-mask, anti-vaccine,” Reed said of Christos. “He would kind of harass other students for wearing masks. He rallied up a bunch of people and did a lot of Trump rallies. He’s the one who got people together for most of them in Northbrook.”\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\n'Legally obtained guns' a big issue, mayor says\n\nHighland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering signed a city ordinance banning assault weapons almost a decade ago, after the Sandy Hook massacre, so the rifle allegedly used in Monday's attack couldn't be legally purchased in the Chicago suburb.\n\n\"At some point this nation needs to have a conversation about these weekly events involving the murder of dozens of people with legally obtained guns,\" she said in an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show. \"If that's what our laws stand for, then I think we have to examine the laws.\"\n\nRotering said that \"somebody clearly had a mental breakdown\" but that the focus should be on access to guns, not mental health.\n\n\"I want us to talk about the fact that there are weapons of war on our streets that people can legally obtain – and then take out dozens of people,\" she said. \"Our community is never going to recover from its wound.\"\n\nA SYNAGOGUE WORKER, A LOVING GRANDFATHER: What we know about the victims of Highland Park shooting\n\nSuspect was turned away at synagogue in April, rabbi says\n\n﻿Crimo apparently tried to enter a synagogue near the shooting site in April and was turned away, according to Rabbi Yosef Schanowitz, co-director of the North Suburban Lubavitch Chabad – Central Avenue Synagogue.\n\nSchanowitz told USA TODAY on Tuesday that authorities have asked him not to speak about the specifics, but confirmed Crimo was asked to leave his synagogue shortly after entering during Passover services. Like many synagogues, the Central Avenue one is guarded by armed security during services, Schanowitz said.\n\nThe synagogue is located along the parade route, and Schanowitz said he rushed outside after the shooting to help protect four Chicago-area teens who were staffing a Jewish information table.\n\n\"The first thing I told them was to call their parents,\" said Schanowitz, who comforted victims and residents after the attack.\n\n\"You hear people who are in disbelief, there are people who are angry, and there are people who are sad and in shock,\" he said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nThe day after: Residents reeling with shock, pain\n\nFBI agents and other law enforcement officers peered into trash cans, looked under picnic blankets and scoured Central Avenue at the site of the shooting searching for evidence. Tori Merel, her husband, Brian, and their 2-year-old son, Miles, placed flowers by the crime scene. Several bouquets lay outside the caution tape and street blocked off by police. Merel, a longtime resident, has lots of friends and family in Highland Park but said none were wounded.\n\n“This is heartbreaking to see this happening here,” said Merel, 38. “We live close by. My son loves firetrucks. I was thinking to myself we should take him to the parade because he loves firetrucks.\"\n\nThat's when they started hearing sirens. Word quickly spread that there was a mass shooter.\n\n“If this can happen here, I promise it can happen anywhere,\" she said. \"This is the last place I would ever imagine something like this happening.”\n\nROBERT CRIMO TAKEN INTO CUSTODY: Highland Park shooting: What we know\n\n'Now Highland Park is in the list of those towns' hit by mass shootings\n\nJustin Dickman, 15, and his siblings made a family tradition of attending the parade each year but skipped Monday's event. If they had attended, sitting in their usual spot outside a T-shirt shop, they’d have been half a block away from the shooter.\n\nHe used to bike around Highland Park without worrying about his safety. Now, Dickman's not sure if anywhere is truly safe.\n\n“Where I grew up is a crime scene now. Knowing that people died where I frequent often, it’s hard to believe,” he said.\n\nA sense of disbelief among residents was paired with the realization that a mass shooting could happen anywhere, even their affluent, quiet suburb.\n\nHighland Park will be listed among Buffalo, Uvalde, Texas, and other cities known for their mass tragedies, said Debbie Winick, who was walking her dog with her daughter.\n\n“I just woke up with that sinking feeling,'' Winick said. \"Like, here we are. Now Highland Park is in the list of those towns.”\n\n– Sophie Carson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nStrong gun laws could face Supreme Court rebuke\n\nThe drumbeat for tighter gun regulations is growing louder, but it might be too late for legislation that could make a difference, warns Dr. Jonathan Metzl, professor of sociology and director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society at Vanderbilt University.\n\n“We are seeing politicians powerfully speaking out about changes to gun laws to make communities like Highland Park safer from gunfire,\" Metlz told USA TODAY. \"However, practically every intervention proposed, such as limiting assault rifles in public and instituting red flag laws, is likely unconstitutional under the recent Supreme Court gun legislation ruling.”\n\nWitness: 'It just devolved. It was chaos.'\n\nAdam Sherman, 30, of Deerfield, was at the parade with his parents and was planning to meet up with his sister and her three children, but he ran into his first-grade teacher and stopped to chat. Soon after, Sherman’s father heard about eight pops and remarked, “They shouldn’t be making those kinds of sounds, given the times we live in.”\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, more shots rang out, and Sherman saw a flood of people running in his direction. Sherman’s father started searching for his daughter and children, but he couldn’t find them. They all began running too.\n\n“One second, it was the parade, and then it just devolved. It was chaos,” Sherman said. “One of those moments, visually, that unfortunately I don’t think I’ll ever forget.”\n\nSherman learned that his sister and her children got home safely. But he worries about how the children, all under 7 years old, will be able to live with what happened.\n\nAs Sherman spoke on a sidewalk near the shooting scene, a loud noise came from a cement truck nearby, startling him and the others around him.\n\n“We shouldn’t have to live in fear,” he said in response.\n\n– Sophie Carson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nGovernor pushes for stricter gun regulations\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, speaking at a news conference hours after the rampage, said the nation's founding fathers carried muskets, not assault weapons, and would not have agreed to a constitutional right to an assault weapon with a high-capacity magazine.\n\n\"Grief will not bring the victims back, and prayers alone will not put a stop to the terror of rampant gun violence in our country,\" Pritzker, a Democrat, said on Twitter. \"I will stand firm with Illinoisans and Americans: we must – and we will – end this plague of gun violence.\"\n\nIllinois Republican gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey apologized for suggesting people \"move on\" during a Facebook live stream from Skokie, where the Fourth of July parade was canceled after the shooting here.\n\n\"The shooter is still at large,\" Bailey said. \"So let's pray for justice to prevail, and then let's move on and let's celebrate the independence of this nation.\"\n\nPanic at fireworks displays in other cities\n\nThe impact of Monday's shooting rampage was felt across the nation. In Orlando, the fireworks celebration at Lake Eola was abruptly ended amid reports of a shooting that caused a chaotic scramble as the crowd fled the area.\n\n\"To our community members now in Downtown Orlando, please know that there is NO evidence of a shooting in the area,\" Orlando Police tweeted. \"Our officers are now working to secure the area. There is NO public safety hazard at this time.\"\n\nIn Harrisburg, Pa., fears of a shooting sent hundreds of people running moments before the city’s fireworks display started. Police said the panic may have been prompted when kids threw firecrackers at the ground.\n\nPolice later reported that a fight had broken out but that \"contrary to some reports, there were no shots fired.\"\n\nIn Washington, D.C., two loud noises near 11th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW prompted people nearby to flee toward the National Mall, The Washington Post reported. Authorities on the scene confirmed the sounds were fireworks and said the noises probably sparked the alarm.\n\nHoliday shootings in Philadelphia, Minneapolis\n\nEight people were wounded, some critically, in a shooting in a Minneapolis park during an unofficial Fourth of July celebration. Police said the assault took place about 11:30 p.m. Monday at Boom Island Park.\n\n“We were just watching fireworks and we just heard a whole bunch of shots,” Kaayla Laanaee told WCCO-TV. “I just heard them going over my head to the trees.”\n\nIn Philadelphia, two police officers were shot during the city's Welcome America Party Monday night. Both were treated at a hospital and released early Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm waiting for something bad to happen all the time.\" Mayor Jim Kenney said. \"I'll be happy when I'm not mayor and I can enjoy some stuff.\"\n\nMass shootings 'an American tradition'?\n\nThere have been 15 shootings in which four or more people have been killed, including the Highland Park attack, across the nation so far in 2022, according to The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University mass killing database.\n\nPritzker said that \"while we celebrate the Fourth of July just once a year, mass shootings have become a weekly – yes, weekly – American tradition.”\n\nBAND MEMBERS EYEWITNESSES TO TRAGEDY:The band struck up a joyous tune as they traveled in the parade. Then the shooting started.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "What it was like inside the Colleyville, Texas, synagogue during the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/safeway-shooting-bend-oregon/index.html", "title": "Bend, Oregon shooting: Victim fought to disarm gunman during ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the victims fought to disarm the suspected gunman during Sunday’s fatal shooting at a Safeway grocery store in Bend, Oregon, according to police spokeswoman Sheila Miller.\n\nTwo people were killed, police said. They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/30/homes/us-home-prices-remote-work/index.html", "title": "Remote work played a key role in fueling the pandemic surge in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pandemic changed the way people lived and, for many, where they lived. Working from home was a significant driver of this “Great Reshuffling” and accounted for more than half of the steep increases in home prices seen during the pandemic, new research has found.\n\nRemote work allowed some people to move to places farther away from their office and prompted others to buy larger homes to accommodate their new lifestyles. The demand for more house and the ability to move to warmer climates played a sizable role in pushing home prices higher, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the University of California, San Diego.\n\nHome prices grew by 23.8% during the pandemic, according to the researchers’ population-weighted analysis of Zillow’s home price index between December 2019 and November 2021. And the study found that remote work accounted for 15.1% of that growth.\n\nThe findings suggest there was more than just speculation behind the turbo-charged growth in home prices during the pandemic, said Johannes Wieland, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, and co-author of the study. He added that the evolution of remote work is likely to have a large impact on the future path of home prices and inflation.\n\n“We were pretty shocked remote work had this impact, once we saw the estimates,” Wieland said. “We thought about how people moving to different locations would be important. And it is. But it is the people who are remaining in a metro area – the people who need more space at home if they work at home – that is really pushing up prices. That is the majority of the story.”\n\nThe findings support what economists at Zillow have been seeing throughout the pandemic.\n\n“We’ve seen what we called the ‘Great Reshuffling’ that has contributed to the demand for housing nationwide,” said Chris Glynn, senior managing economist at Zillow. “It has accelerated trends that existed before the pandemic. Migration to places like Austin [Texas] and Raleigh [North Carolina] has been happening for a while, but the pandemic accelerated it because of the un-tethering between an office and home that has allowed people to make choices about where they want to live.”\n\nWhat makes a hot remote work spot\n\nThe Sun Belt attracted remote workers looking for a warm weather lifestyle even before the pandemic. But the researchers found that the trend gained further momentum during the pandemic, pushing up home prices in those areas at a much faster rate than before the pandemic.\n\nBy the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median single-family, existing-home price in Austin had grown by 26% from the year before, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices in Phoenix were also up by 26% and in Boise, Idaho, by 24.3%.\n\nThe researchers found that cities that already had a large share of remote workers before the pandemic tended to attract even more after the pandemic shutdowns pushed a whole wave of people to work remotely.\n\n“Where more people are working remotely, that’s where the home prices grow,” said Wieland, who noted that cities like Austin, Boise, Phoenix and San Diego saw some of the biggest home prices increases in the country as a result.\n\nThese remote-work-friendly cities share three main features, he said. The first is a predominant industry that allows for remote work. Tech jobs, for example, are easily done remotely because they mostly involve work on a computer, he noted.\n\nThe second aspect is a lower population density, where there is more space and more affordable housing than in the biggest cities in the country.\n\n“It is hard to work at home in New York City, for example,” he said, explaining the cost of living there means that having extra space for an office comes at a premium. “Lower-density areas are more attractive for remote work.”\n\nThe third feature is a warmer climate or appealing lifestyle. “There is more remote work where the weather is nice,” he said. “When you’re not tied to a location because of your job, you can choose where you want to be. Many of these places…are attractive to people who can move to a place for lifestyle and not for work.”\n\nThat is why many of the cities in the Sun Belt saw such huge increases in home prices during the pandemic, he explained.\n\nA fast impact on home prices\n\nThe pandemic spurred us to change the way we work very quickly, said Wieland.\n\n“There hasn’t been a peacetime period where we have changed the way we do work in such a quick fashion,” he said. “Suddenly, we are moving further away from where our work is located. We don’t need the office space. We now need this home space for work.”\n\nIn a perfect world, you’d want to see the economy adapt to this change in preferences and opportunities, he said. “But it is hard to do with housing in a year or two, especially at a time when supply is not very high to begin with,” he said. “That is one of the reasons why home prices are going up at such a rapid rate.”\n\nIn their research, Wieland and his co-author John A. Mondragon, an economic research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked at a housing market impacted by many variables, including the low supply of homes for sale, a demographic bulge of Millennials reaching typical home buying age and the Fed’s slashing of interest rates during the pandemic, which resulted in ultra-low mortgage rates for more than a year.\n\nThe researchers measured the amount home prices in an area went up as it related to the amount of remote workers living in the area.\n\nNBER working papers are circulated for discussion and comment purposes, but they have not been peer-reviewed or reviewed by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official NBER publications.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/04/09/south-lake-tahoe-parking-fine-airbnb-renters/500119002/", "title": "How South Lake Tahoe started the $2,000 parking fine for vacationers", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\nReno Gazette-Journal\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe’s beefed-up vacation home rental law was supposed to help prevent noise violations, obnoxious partying and bad actors from disturbing the city’s residential neighborhoods.\n\nThree months since the updated ordinance went into effect, however, the law has primarily turned into a tool for doling out $2,000 parking tickets against non-disorderly visitors who rent houses through online sites such as Airbnb and Vacation Rentals by Owner, a Reno Gazette Journal investigation found.\n\nDescribed as the strictest ordinance in the Lake Tahoe basin for vacation home rentals, South Lake Tahoe’s updated law added caps and steep fines in response to community concerns about the explosive growth seen in tourists using residential homes for lodging. One avid traveler from the Bay Area called the ordinance “absurd” and “arbitrary” after renting a home in the city earlier this year.\n\nA regular user of online listing sites such as Airbnb and VRBO, Shirin Oloumi-Knerr says she enjoys going on ski weekends with her husband and three other couples they frequently travel with. Many times, this means making the drive up the twisting mountain roads of the Sierra Nevada and renting a house together at Lake Tahoe.\n\n“We felt like staying in one house was the best way to cook meals together and hang out in larger common spaces that were still private,” Oloumi-Knerr said.\n\nWhile visiting in February, however, Oloumi-Knerr noticed something about the South Lake Tahoe house they were staying at.\n\nThe property was peppered with warning signs threatening steep fines, not just for noise but also what she considers “harmless, arbitrary acts” such as parking on the street and hot tub use. In addition to paying a minimum $1,000 fine, Oloumi-Knerr says she was shocked to find out that property managers also get fined $1,000 by the city for renter violations, but the fine is typically passed on to guests.\n\nThis means vacation home renters essentially get fined twice to the tune of $2,000 total.\n\nFor Oloumi-Knerr, the thought of paying that much money for simply parking on the street or using the hot tub at the wrong time was dumbfounding.\n\n“I’m a government lawyer — rules and regulations are my bread and butter,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “However, these rules seem to have no rhyme or reason and have the potential for abusive enforcement.”\n\nOloumi-Knerr’s concerns reflect an ongoing battle being waged around Lake Tahoe’s shores as the Airbnb economy continues to disrupt traditional lodging and send more tourists to residential neighborhoods.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe is just one of many cities around the nation playing catch up to the phenomenon with their laws. After years of community debate and public meetings, South Lake Tahoe approved its updated vacation home rental or VHR ordinance in November, with the law officially taking effect on Dec. 22.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP: Complaints and citations against vacation home rentals during the first 3 months of South Lake Tahoe’s updated VHR ordinance. The red points represent complaints that resulted in a citation. Yellow points resulted in no citation. (Data provided by city of South Lake Tahoe. Map by Brian Duggan, RGJ)\n\nThe intent behind the change was to control the explosive growth of the vacation home rental industry, particularly from what critics view as its encroachment on residential neighborhoods. At the top of the list of priorities is curbing incidents of bad behavior by tenants, including the loud noises, trash and occupancy issues that can arise when short-term rental properties are used by large groups or partiers.\n\nA Reno Gazette Journal analysis of complaints filed against nearly 200 properties from Dec. 22 to late March, however, found the ordinance has primarily been used to cite South Lake Tahoe visitors for parking violations.\n\nReveling partygoers, meanwhile, were few and far between even with Christmas and New Year's included.\n\nFindings of the RGJ investigation include:\n\n• About a third of the complaints turned out to be violations: Of the 186 complaints made by neighbors against properties for allegedly violating the city’s vacation home rental ordinance, 74 — a little over a third — were deemed by code enforcement to be violations. At least one in five complaints were false alarms.\n\n• The law is being used to enforce hefty parking violations: Parking accounted for 51 percent of all complaints made by callers and 60 percent of all violations cited by enforcement officers. The total fines levied for parking during the first three months of the updated VHR ordinance added up to about $90,000.\n\n• Noise, the second-highest complaint, accounted for just a fifth of all complaints: Out of those 47 noise complaints, 10 were determined to be violations, with only three being tied to partying. The rest were deemed by enforcement officers to be within reason and not too loud.\n\nWith parking accounting for the bulk of violations that vacation home rental users are being cited for, the trend raises questions about whether the stricter ordinance is unfairly punishing visitors for minor issues instead of focusing on more serious offenders.\n\nOne person who isn’t a fan of the ordinance’s one-fine-fits-all approach is Oloumi-Knerr, who feels it places needless stress on visitors, who have to worry about unwittingly breaking its rules. Oloumi-Knerr says she has such \"strong negative feelings\" toward the ordinance that she has decided to cross off South Lake Tahoe in her list of places to stay when visiting the area.\n\n“First, it doesn’t make me feel welcome in the neighborhood,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “I don’t want to place myself in a situation where I could be otherwise acting legally but am violating a local, unreasonable and expensive ordinance.”\n\nThe birth of Tahoe’s strictest vacation rental law\n\nIt’s an early Tuesday morning in March and South Lake Tahoe resident Peggy Bourland was packing her things in a hurry.\n\nReached by phone while preparing to leave for Los Angeles, a rushed Bourland says she only has an hour to get ready and does not have time to talk. Once the subject of vacation home rentals came up, however, an exasperated Bourland couldn’t help but vent her frustration.\n\n“This issue goes back 15 years,” Bourland said. “We’re looking for a remedy … to halt this runaway train that’s sort of happening with the issue of additional vacation home rentals without a lot of restriction.”\n\nThe anger felt by residents such as Bourland stems from what they see as the increasing encroachment by vacation home rentals into their neighborhoods. As more visitors turn to rentals, a larger chunk of the tourist crowd is being funneled from areas such as downtown to the city’s residential neighborhoods.\n\nThis can especially add up during busy seasons. Each year, about 3 million people visit Lake Tahoe. That tops Yellowstone Park and rivals visitor numbers for the Grand Canyon, said nonprofit advocacy group, the Tahoe Fund. Meanwhile, the resident population of Lake Tahoe year-round is about 53,000. Throw in visitors into the mix and its total population can swell up to 300,000 on peak days, according to the Tahoe Fund.\n\nThe issue with population goes beyond just hard numbers, according to critics of vacation home rentals. Bourland blames the influx of investor-owned, short-term rental properties for a significant drop in the residential population of South Lake Tahoe.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers back Bourland’s claim about a population decline.\n\nThe residential population of South Lake Tahoe fell by 9.3 percent from 23,609 in 2000 to 21,403 in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. The numbers increased slightly to 21,717 in 2016 but are still below the numbers from nearly two decades ago.\n\nThose in the vacation home rental industry question the link between VHRs and the population decline. Bourland, however, strongly believes that the explosion in vacation home rentals is further tilting the demographic balance of the city’s residential areas toward visitors.\n\nThe longtime resident, who started living in Tahoe in 1972, says it’s ironic that more tourists are staying in residential neighborhoods while more full-time residents end up staying in motels because they can’t find or afford housing.\n\n“Residential housing is being absorbed by mostly out-of-town investors who buy so-called second homes to turn them into investments as vacation home rentals,” Bourland said. “Our neighborhoods have fewer full-time residents and (our) sense of community is being eroded.”\n\nThe frustration felt by some residents regarding VHR use culminated in the formation of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group three years ago. The organization, which counts Bourland as a member, has been strongly pushing for stricter regulations to curb the growth of vacation home rentals in Tahoe. Issues cited by residents include parking, trash and noise violations by rental users.\n\nHEAT MAP: Hot spots for South Lake Tahoe neighborhoods that receive the most complaints against vacation home rentals. Areas that have more concentration of complaints are highlighted by brighter colors. (Data provided by city of South Lake Tahoe. Map by Brian Duggan, RGJ)\n\nSuch concerns were cited by South Lake Tahoe as one of the driving forces behind beefing up the city’s VHR laws. Initially created in 2005, the city’s ordinance for vacation home rentals has been modified several times, said Tracy Sheldon, a public information officer for the city of South Lake Tahoe. The most recent change called for stricter enforcement of the ordinance as well as steeper penalties for violations.\n\n“This was a response from city council to concerns, specifically from vacation rental management companies and community citizens, requesting that the enforcement be stepped up — which it has — and also for the fines to be increased,” Sheldon said.\n\nAlthough opinions vary about the merits of the change, there is consensus on one thing: Area property managers and officials from around the basin who spoke to the Reno Gazette Journal agreed that South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance is in a league of its own.\n\n“It’s by far the strictest in the basin, no question,” said Steve Teshara, CEO of the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe’s ordinance specifically has five main areas of focus, said Lauren Gresh, a Tahoe-based operations manager for international vacation rental management company Vacasa. Those are noise, parking, occupancy, hot tub use and trash. The ordinance, for example, imposes limits on a rental’s number of occupants based on the number of rooms and parking spaces. It also prohibits hot tub use by vacation home rental users from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m., as well as parking on the street and unpaved surfaces at all times.\n\nMost of the requirements are clearly targeted at curbing nuisances in residential neighborhoods, Gresh said. This includes noise and overcrowding as well as excessive parking, which can arise when people rent homes to hold parties during events like spring break or New Year’s.\n\nVisitors can’t simply claim ignorance about the rules as the ordinance requires signage to be clearly posted on VHR properties. One key change since December is that violators no longer get a warning. Any violation automatically earns a fine.\n\nGresh says the penalties are no joke, with renters potentially facing double the $1,000 minimum if their actions cause a property owner to be fined as well.\n\n“This is very important and we want all our guests to be fully aware of what these regulations are so there are no surprises and they plan accordingly when they come up here,” Gresh said. “If they want to have friends over, for example, they need to book a house that can accommodate that amount of occupancy or they risk getting a violation.”\n\nDespite being the strictest around the lake basin, Tahoe’s vacation rental ordinance still is not the toughest in the nation, said Greg Holcomb, government relations manager of the Vacation Rental Management Association.\n\nCalifornia communities such as Santa Monica, for example, have outright bans on short-term vacation rentals, Holcomb said. Then there are places such as Cannon Beach in Oregon, which has a lottery system in place for people who want to acquire a VHR license.\n\nGenerally, major metropolitan cities — places such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago — have the most onerous and complicated ordinances for vacation rentals, Holcomb said. The Vacation Rental Management Association blames the confusing nature of some of these rules for the low compliance rates seen in the larger metros that have tough laws for vacation home rentals.\n\n“A stricter set of regulations doesn’t mean that the community is solving the problems they are hoping to solve,” Holcomb said. “Creating onerous rules is due to current policies failing and the community not addressing the actual core issues, they are simply throwing more hurdles for property owners.”\n\nA question of fairness\n\nAs a young boy, Stu Roberson remembers leaving the hustle and bustle of the Bay Area with his family and making their way through the pine tree-dotted landscapes of the Sierra Nevada each year.\n\nFor the Robersons, those winding mountain roads always led to the same destination: Lake Tahoe.\n\nIt was on the sandy shores of a rented house in Agate Bay that Roberson caught the Tahoe bug. Today, the 59-year-old and his wife own two Tahoe properties that they rent out and also manage several others as part of their business, RnR Vacation Rentals.\n\nRoberson and his wife officially became Tahoe residents this year as well. With some Tahoe locals voicing strong opposition against vacation home rentals owned by out-of-state residents, the change in residency is a good move for the Robersons in more ways than one.\n\nAlthough Roberson rents out his own houses to visitors and manages vacation rentals for others, he is not completely opposed to South Lake Tahoe’s vacation home rental ordinance. The law, for example, is great at dealing with problem renters or simply encouraging vacation rental users to be on their best behavior.\n\n“The good part is that (the regulations have) given us some teeth,” Roberson said. “The ordinance is great at holding people accountable.”\n\nAt least four of the nearly 200 complaints filed against South Lake Tahoe vacationers during the first three months of the updated ordinance actually were filed by property owners or managers who were worried that their renters were not following the rules, the Reno Gazette Journal found.\n\nIn some cases, however, Roberson believes that the tough, shotgun approach employed by the ordinance goes too far. A closer look at the city’s beefed-up ordinance shows three key changes that can cause property renters and vacationers to pay a high price — literally — for even minor violations.\n\nOne is the addition of a cap that limits the number of vacation home rental permits issued by the city to 1,400. Critics claim the caps violate their property rights, including the ability to rent out their houses in a market that has a long history of vacation home rental use.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe already issued 1,398 permits by late March, according to spokeswoman Sheldon. Sheldon also confirmed that the city has no plans to raise the permit limit, dashing the hopes of people such as Roberson.\n\nVacation rental advocates were hoping that the 1,400 limit was just a starting point that can be tweaked based on demand. Barring an increase in the cap, applicants will have to wait for openings that are created when existing permits are either not renewed by a current holder or taken away for violations.\n\nRoberson says he does not fully agree with the need for permit caps but understands the reason behind them.\n\n“On one hand, I do believe in a free market but, on the other hand, we do need to think about how far we want this to go,” Roberson said. “Do we want all residential areas to be vacation home rentals? I don’t think anybody wants that.”\n\nRoberson would like to see new permit reviews done on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis. As the waiting list for open slots grows, it adds a lot of uncertainty for applicants because they have no idea when they are likely to get a permit, Roberson said.\n\nThe cap is also being blamed for causing unintended consequences, including some of the very issues it is trying to prevent.\n\nPrior to the limit on permits, South Lake Tahoe’s vacation home rental market essentially self-regulated its numbers, Roberson said. Once word of a potential cap came out, however, the city saw a surge in applicants who were trying to get ahead of the change in the law, Roberson said.\n\nBourland of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group confirmed the increase.\n\n“We have 259 more vacation home rentals than we did when the debate started 3 years ago and these are in residential neighborhoods,” Bourland said. “There’s been a couple of very rigid well-intended ordinances that haven’t really resulted in any reduction of numbers (for vacation home rentals).”\n\nA second concern — and a big one for folks such as Roberson as well as vacationers — involves the larger fines. After Dec. 22, the minimum fine for violating the ordinance was raised to $1,000 each for the renter and property owner. Because of a one-size-fits-all approach to fines, the harsh punishment often does not match the violation, Roberson said.\n\nIt’s one thing to fine visitors who knowingly bring in way too many people and cause a racket in the neighborhood, Roberson said. Hitting a visitor with a hefty fine for parking on the street for a few minutes, on the other hand, seems unnecessarily heavy-handed, he said. Punishing vacationers for street parking seems even more unfair when residents and long-term renters are not subject to the same rules, according to Roberson.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that vacation home rental contracts typically make renters responsible for paying the fines incurred by property owners due to a vacationer’s violations. This means visitors end up paying double the fine.\n\nRoberson recounted one time when a customer briefly parked in the street during breakfast and quickly got reported to code enforcement by a neighbor within minutes.\n\n“Our poor customer had to pay a $2,000 fine because he parked in front of the street, which everyone else can do,” Roberson said. “This wasn’t someone who was making a lot of noise or was being a troublemaker — this was exactly the type of person you want visiting Lake Tahoe.”\n\nOf the 45 vacationers fined for parking from Dec. 22 to late March, 10 did not exceed the limit for the number of cars allowed on the property, the RGJ’s analysis found. Instead, they were mostly parked on the street or the dirt, which is considered a violation.\n\nOne example involves a case from Dec. 28 on a property that allowed parking for three cars. At the time, one car was parked on the street, another car was parked on the driveway and a third was parked in the dirt next to the driveway. The occupants, who were unloading at the time, were fined $1,000 as was the property owner, according to the citation report.\n\nAlthough vacation rental owners can pass fines to their renters, they are not completely off the hook from violations. If a property gets three violations or “three strikes” in two years, the owner of that property loses their permit permanently. Roberson called the punishment too severe, especially if the offenses involved minor violations such as street parking. In contrast, long-term rentals are not subject to the same “three-strikes rule.”\n\n“If you had three citations in any two-year period, you lose your permit … not just until you reapply, you lose it for life,” Roberson said. “That’s a pretty severe consequence, particularly if it was the result of having a neighbor who was just fed up (about having vacation home rentals in the neighborhood).”\n\nA neighborhood civil war\n\nRoberson says he understands the frustration felt by some residents with vacation home rentals. If people are making too much noise or a specific property seems to be a serial offender and always has issues, such cases should be shut down, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Roberson feels that the new laws have “generated a bit of a posse out there” and given the most disgruntled neighbors license to go around and actively search for incidents to report. In some cases, the gap between a violation and the arrival of a code enforcement officer is so short that it is almost certain whoever made the call was actively monitoring the house, Roberson said.\n\nTeshara, who advocates for a balanced approach to regulating vacation home rentals, was critical of what he described as “militant anti-VHR people” who have an ax to grind. Although some complaints against vacation home rentals have merit — he has experienced some of those challenges with visitors himself — some of them go too far, Teshara said.\n\n“We know there are some people who specifically target a vacation rental (or owner) in their neighborhood to make sure that person loses their license,” Teshara said. “It’s a bit of a harassment situation.”\n\nThe Reno Gazette Journal found at least one instance where a neighbor was specifically targeting one rental property. On Feb. 19, a South Lake Tahoe code enforcement officer responded to a complaint about a property on Sky Meadows Court having too many cars, too many people and an incorrect sign.\n\nIn the ensuing report, the officer wrote about waking up a “peaceful church group,” who admitted to having one too many cars. As a result, the officer had to issue them a $1,000 citation for parking. The officer noted, however, that the property had the proper number of occupants and the correct signs. According to the report, the officer also was stopped by the neighbor who made the complaint upon arrival.\n\n“(Complainant) flagged me down and said, ‘I don’t have a problem with renters, but with the owner,’” the officer wrote down.\n\nThe same house also was reported on Dec. 30 for having too many people. The property was occupied by the owner at the time and did not receive a citation. Properties on Sky Meadows Court have received 6 complaints in the first two months after the updated ordinance came into effect. Only one of those complaints resulted in a violation.\n\nConcerned about what it considers to be extreme positions among the anti-vacation rental crowd, the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce decided to join forces with other groups to form the Sustainable Community Alliance. The group is particularly worried about the possibility of a wider ban on vacation home rentals in South Lake Tahoe.\n\nTeshara criticized the city for acting too slowly and allowing the raw emotions felt by residents to fester over the years.\n\n“They sort of let the issue become a very emotional one and that was unfortunate,” Teshara said. “I think there’s still a balance that can be struck between vacation home rentals and a complete ban and that’s what the Sustainable Community Alliance is all about.”\n\nThe city, meanwhile, says it has been very open to the community with its process to improve its vacation home rental ordinance.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe says it made a strong effort to ensure that it received input from everyone and that both sides of the issue were well represented as the ordinance was being updated. The city pointed to the support it received from not just citizens but vacation rental management companies for the new regulations.\n\n“Our changes to the ordinance were made in response to specific requests from both groups,” Sheldon said. “Many, many public meetings were held on this.”\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe also pushed back against criticism that describes the updated ordinance as an anti-Airbnb law. The ordinance specifically focuses on the management of VHRs and the conduct of the people who rent them, not the online platforms that are driving the Internet-fueled vacation home rental boom, the city said.\n\n“Airbnb is not a vacation rental management company,” South Lake Tahoe’s Sheldon said. “There has been some confusion with the ordinance regarding Airbnb and VRBO but those are tools used for advertising and not tools used to manage properties.”\n\nAt the same time, homeowners who use online sites to list their properties but do not have a VHR permit from the city will be issued a citation, Sheldon said. Many professional management companies also use sites such as Airbnb and VRBO to list their properties.\n\nLack of consensus in vacation rental industry\n\nThe response from the industry to South Lake Tahoe’s stricter vacation home rental ordinance has been mixed so far.\n\nTwo heavyweights in the vacation home rental space, HomeAway and Airbnb, struck a conciliatory tone when asked by the Reno Gazette Journal about the ordinance. HomeAway, which acquired VRBO in 2006, sounded especially positive about the stricter regulations.\n\n“We applaud South Lake Tahoe’s pursuit of common-sense vacation rental regulations and the creation of a dedicated Vacation Home Rental team within the city government,” said Eric Donovan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for HomeAway. “We look forward to continuing productive conversations with our local vacation rental owners and managers, neighborhood leaders and policymakers regarding the rollout of rules that benefit local homeowners, the South Lake Tahoe economy and the community at large.”\n\nAirbnb, while not criticizing the change, offered a more measured response.\n\n“We are committed to promoting travel and tourism to South Lake Tahoe and to making sure that the local economy upon which it relies, is able to prosper,” said Jasmine Mora, a spokeswoman for Airbnb. “We want to work with cities on reasonable rules that promote responsible tourism and also allow families to visit South Lake Tahoe year-round.”\n\nNot everyone in the industry, however, was as conciliatory. The Vacation Rental Management Association, a Washington, D.C.-based vacation rental advocacy group that represents a large number of members from 23 countries, gave a blistering response to the South Lake Tahoe ordinance.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe’s cap, in particular, “seems arbitrary and will lead to confusion in the long-term,” VRMA government relations manager Holcomb said.\n\nHolcomb also raised concerns about the wording of the city’s occupancy rules, which states that occupancy will be calculated based on the number of people present at the property “at any given time.” The language essentially allows the city to fine an operator if a property is at maximum capacity and a delivery person, housekeeper, maintenance guy or neighbor walks into the house, Holcomb said. An RGJ analysis of all complaints made during the first three months of the law, however, showed that code enforcement officers did not cite properties for violations during two instances when a cleaning staff member was at a property.\n\nHolcomb admitted that there has been a trend not just in the United States but around the world to create regulatory frameworks around vacation homes and short-term rentals. In most cases, however, those regulations don’t include excessive fines and punishments that do not fit the purported crime, Holcomb said.\n\n“The lack of warnings and an excessive fine structure is criminalizing travelers and property owners,” Holcomb said.\n\n“Our members, who have been community staples for decades, are now strapped with difficult-to-navigate regulations like these that hinder their ability to conduct business and generate tourism and economic activity for vacation destinations like South Lake Tahoe.”\n\nOthers, meanwhile, contend that the ordinance does not go far enough. Fed up with what it sees as an inadequate response by the city of South Lake Tahoe, Bourland and the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group decided to launch a petition that seeks to phase out vacation home rentals that are outside of South Lake Tahoe’s tourist core within three years. The initiative, which requires signatures from 10 percent of the city’s registered voters in order to make the ballot for the November elections, makes exceptions for long-term rentals and properties that are owned by full-time residents.\n\nThe problem with the city’s VHR ordinance is that it does not address the root of the issue, which is allowing “incompatible uses” for vacation homes in residential neighborhoods, Bourland said.\n\n“The city seems to believe that higher fees and steep code enforcement fines will solve the problem (but) these are merely Band-Aids,” Bourland said. “The real problem is that we have transgressed on our zoning laws to provide special use permits for businesses to operate in residential zones.”\n\nPlaying catch up\n\nIdeally, it would be great to have a more uniform set of ordinances for vacation home rentals around Lake Tahoe to make things less confusing for visitors, according to representatives of several Tahoe counties.\n\nWhat works for one county, however, will not necessarily work for another. Although Placer County has no plans to emulate South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance, for example, the latter’s tougher stance is understandable, said Jennifer Merchant, deputy county executive officer for Placer.\n\n“North Lake Tahoe is geared more for families and outdoor recreation so we’re not as heavy on nightlife as South Lake Tahoe,” Merchant said. “Every single one of our own jurisdictions has a slightly different market as well.”\n\nThere’s another big reason why it would be tough to come up with uniform standards around the lake: money.\n\nPlacer County, for example, collected $18 million from transient occupancy taxes in its last fiscal year for short-term rentals, which includes vacation homes. The taxes are generated by room stays of 30 days or less. Placer directly invests 60 percent of its revenue from transient occupancy taxes into capital improvement, transit and other projects requested by visitors and locals alike, Merchant said.\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe also generates significant revenue from the industry. Of the $1 million in transient occupancy tax that the city collected in December, about $406,000 came from vacation home rentals managed by individuals and professional managers.\n\n“It’s fair to say that we get those phone calls from people (complaining about vacation rental users) but it’s hard for a community that’s really built on a tourist economy to turn away tourists,” Merchant said. “We have other secondary markets but tourism is our key economic driver.”\n\nPlacer also has a long history of allowing people to vacation rent their houses, with many homeowners relying on the rental income to pay the property’s mortgage. Instead of passing a separate ordinance for vacation rentals, Placer will continue to handle complaints through its nuisance laws.\n\nWashoe County, another area that borders Lake Tahoe, is taking a similar approach by handling vacation rental issues through its existing regulations. The bigger problem facing Washoe involves rental owners who don’t pay taxes, said Bob Webb, a Washoe County planning manager.\n\n“Now that we have a web-based exchange economy, we’re playing catch up a lot of times,” Webb said.\n\nA spokeswoman for another Tahoe county agreed. Eldorado County, which is where South Lake Tahoe is located, is working on changes to its own ordinance. There has been a lot of confusion about which ordinances apply to which areas ever since South Lake Tahoe's updated regulations were passed, said Carla Hass, Eldorado County communications director.\n\n“Airbnb wasn’t even in existence when our ordinance was first written, so there’s a little bit of catch up for us,” said Carla Hass, Eldorado County communications director.\n\nFor some vacationers, they say South Lake Tahoe’s ordinance simply goes too far by essentially turning visitors into second-class citizens. Being fined for behavior that is OK for residents and long-term renters remains a point of contention for those opposed to the tougher law.\n\n“A quiet soaker watching the sunrise gets a $1,000 fine,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “This is a hot tub that is on the home’s private property, and yet its use is controlled in a way that could lead to absurd results.”\n\nFor groups such as the Lake Tahoe South Shore Chamber of Commerce, comments such as Oloumi-Knerr’s are a major source of concern. The last thing any of the cities and counties in Lake Tahoe want is to develop a reputation of being unfriendly to visitors, particularly since the area is heavily dependent on tourism dollars, Teshara said.\n\nTeshara says he has heard his fair share of incidents involving tourists who excitedly arrive at their vacation rental, only to be fined within minutes while unloading because they parked their car on the street. This is especially a problem in neighborhoods that do not have clearly delineated streets or parking areas, Teshera said.\n\nBourland, meanwhile, placed the blame for such issues on the city, not the members of the Tahoe Neighborhoods Group.\n\n“One thousand-dollar fines for sometimes minor infractions is how the city has chosen to attempt to control the issue,” Bourland said. “Once again (it’s) a Band-Aid rather than addressing the real issue of allowing incompatible uses.”\n\nClassifying vacation home rentals as incompatible and taking them out of residential neighborhoods, however, is not a balanced approach, Teshara said. If anything, it’s the kind of move that can lead to unintended consequences, he said.\n\n“If you ban vacation home rentals, the city budget will take a significant hit,” Teshara said. “The same people who say ‘well, we don’t like them so get rid of them,’ they’ll be the first ones to complain when city services are cut.”\n\nDespite her less than ideal experience during her last visit, Oloumi-Knerr continues to be a fan of visiting Lake Tahoe. At the same time, she does not want to stress out again about potentially running afoul of South Lake Tahoe’s laws.\n\nInstead, she plans to take her business somewhere else where she can park on the street or enjoy watching the Tahoe sunrise in peace while relaxing in a hot tub.\n\n“If the rules were based on common sense, I could follow them without fear (but) it’s not clear to me what the purpose of this ordinance is,” Oloumi-Knerr said. “Now that I know it’s a South Lake Tahoe ordinance, I’m firmly a North Lake Tahoe fan.”\n\n— This story is part of a Reno Gazette Journal series on Lake Tahoe’s struggles with the explosive growth of vacation home rentals and how it is splitting the popular tourist destination’s community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/sarasota/2021/09/10/herald-tribune-readers-share-their-stories-sept-11-2001-9-11-where-were-you-on-9-11/5713637001/", "title": "Sarasota Herald-Tribune readers share their stories from 9/11 attacks", "text": "Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nWe asked our readers to share their Sept. 11 memories. We received a tremendous response and regret that we cannot share them all. Here are many of the experiences that our readers will never forget. Some have been edited for length.\n\nMarvin Crepea\n\nLakewood Ranch\n\nI worked in downtown Manhattan for more than 15 years, by the World Trade Center, lunching in the WTC Plaza, shopping in the WTC underground mall, and never would have imagined that anything could cause it to fall. With the sound of the tower collapsing all pandemonium broke out.\n\nI don't know why, but just seconds before, in the back of my mind I had looked over my shoulder to see if there was a safe place to go -- when I noticed a doorway just off the corner. Instinctively, as the tower crumbled, everyone around the area believed that it had no place to fall but where I was standing -- I dived into the doorway and knelt down with my head between my knees, covered-up and prayed. The sound of the crashing tower was not to be believed when simultaneously a black cloud of smoke and soot and debris came rushing out like a black wall of death at 100 mph.\n\nWithin seconds day turned to night and the air was excruciating thick with black smoke and soot. Now the people around me were screaming to get into the building as we couldn't breathe -- I held my breath and crouched down low. The door was closed and we yelled for the people inside to open up. Eventually, one of the young guys jimmied the door open and the small group of around 15 to 30 rushed in. I was knocked down by the crowd since I had been crouching down and visibility was zero. People walked over me, practically trampling me as I slowly crawled on all fours in to the building. I made it in and tumbled down a basement stairwell where the air was clearer. Everyone was silent. Outside was pitch black with smoke and we had no idea the extent of the damage. As the initial shock subsided we looked at each other and saw that we were covered totally with soot and debris! I had even lost my shoes.\n\nWe waited for about 20 minutes for the outside air to settle enough so that we could see at least 5-10 feet. At that point we filed out one by one on to the street, Broadway/Maiden Lane, which now looked like a ghostly, surreal alien landscape. Where minutes before Broadway was packed with emergency vehicles, people, police firemen -- it was now totally silent, barren except for about a foot of debris. The sight of dozens of empty shoes littering the street was not to be believed. Either the force of the falling tower or the reaction of the body to sudden disaster caused people’s feet to literally leave their shoes.\n\nCeremonies:Sarasota, Manatee remembrance services to mark the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks\n\nBrig. Gen. Robert V Taylor, Ret.\n\nSarasota\n\nI was in the Pentagon as a member of the Secretary of the Army‘s Reserve Forces Policy Committee, representing the Army National Guard. That morning our meeting was being held in the Deputy Chief of Staff/G3 conference room, the first time we had ever met in that location. We had always conducted our meeting in the Deputy Chief of Staff/G1 conference room. Both rooms are on the outside E Ring just two corridors apart.\n\nThe plane flew into the G1 Conference room. LTG Tim Maude, Army G1 and many of his staff were killed. He was a member of our committee. The force of the impact was significant – felt like a missile hit the building. Exiting the Pentagon was a challenge with smoke and fear of massing into the south parking lot which posed another potential target of opportunity. Not knowing what had hit the building, my experience told me to not mass and become a large target of opportunity. I chose to find an exit away from parking lots.\n\nMy hotel was across from the Pentagon. They brought in large fans to suck out fumes from the burning jet fuel that evening.\n\nMy return to duty station in Michigan on 9/12 was a story in itself. No rentals cars and obviously no commercial air. The Chief National Guard Bureau coordinated a flight from Andrews AFB. I traveled with two other GO’s on a military KC 135 on 9/12. First stop was Detroit Metropolitan Airport where I was met by a military C-12, which flew me to Lansing. The KC 135 then flew to Idaho and then Oregon to drop off the other two GO’s. Eerie….flying into Detroit. The only aircraft flying were Air Force and Air National Guard fighters providing Combat Air Patrol.\n\nMore:The 9/11 classroom: Booker Elementary students, now 27, recall President Bush's visit in CNN special\n\nJackie Becher\n\nSarasota\n\nI was awakened by the phone ringing, it was my brother telling me to turn on the television. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Then the second plane tore into the tower and reality set in. As the day progressed the losses were devastating.\n\nThere was no transportation, people had to walk home. We live on East 57th Street, close to the 59th Street bridge. Second Avenue is a wide street, hoards of people were marching up Second Avenue to the bridge but you couldn’t see the ground through the thousands of marchers.\n\nBut I was gladdened by the sight of people helping people. A pregnant woman sitting on the curb was taken into a neighbor’s apartment to rest, along with others, we brought bottles of water to these marchers.\n\nI walked my dog watching police/sheriff cars speed down Second Avenue. They came to help from all over the country, cars from Iowa, Georgia, Wisconsin, Montana, Virginia, almost every state.\n\nI choke up now writing this remembering how the country came together and wonder how we ever drifted so far apart.\n\n20 years later:Looking back at Sarasota's chilling, unusual connections to 9/11\n\nMichael Litz\n\nArizona\n\nI am a born and raised Sarasota native. On September 11, 2001 I was a Winn-Dixie truck driver. I had driven from our warehouse at Clark and McIntosh to the Apollo Beach Winn-Dixie. I was getting out of the truck and heard on the radio that a plane had struck a World Trade Center. I assumed it was a small plane that had made an error. I hadn’t even left the parking lot when I heard a second plane had hit and instantly knew what that meant.\n\nIn subsequent days I was looking for ways to contribute to the cause. I applied for a federal law enforcement position and went to work for the U.S government in a counterterrorism role. This has encompassed many things, from flying armed to chasing smugglers sneaking into the country to surveillance operations. I am still in that role on the Arizona border with seven years to go before mandatory retirement. September 11, 2001 altered the course of my life….but it didn’t end it as it did for so many.\n\nSubsequent wars are winding to a close now with many more thousands dead, trillions spent, and we are in the same position. Terrorists are in control of those targeted hot beds and America is still in their crosshairs.\n\nWe’re still out here doing what we can.\n\nGuy Kulman\n\nNew York City, grew up in Sarasota\n\nSept. 11, 2001, was my second day at Lehman Brothers. I lived in Manhattan and took the subway from Columbus Circle to the World Trade Center. As the train approached downtown, the conductor announced: “This train is going express.” I wasn’t sure if it would stop at WTC, so I got off at Chambers. As I climbed up the steps, I heard a boom.\n\nA woman started screaming, “A helicopter hit the World Trade Center.” I looked at the tower and thought the damage seemed containable. I dialed my mom in Sarasota. “Mom, a helicopter hit the World Trade Center,” I told her. “Don’t worry, I don’t work there. I’m heading to work.”\n\nWhen I finally got to 3 WFC, I realized how close it was to the World Trade Center. Then, I heard another explosion. I took off. Some guy was running next to me. He said, “A plane hit the World Trade Center.” I said, “It was a helicopter.” He said, “No, a plane, two planes hit the towers.” It was then that I turned around and saw both towers on fire.\n\nI called my mom: “Mom, President Bush is in Sarasota. Stay away from him. We are under attack.”\n\nBonnie Silvestri\n\nSarasota\n\nOn September 11, I was aboard the express train when the planes hit. At the Chambers Street station, I could barely climb the stairs because people had congregated to look at the unfathomable sight in front of us, the World Trade Center towers on fire. I quickly realized the gravity of the circumstances and walked 4 1/2 miles back to my apartment on the Upper West Side.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I worked as part of a core group of attorneys at the Family Assistance Center on the city’s death certificate program. Although I was concerned about my emotional preparedness for this task, it was the best thing I could have done to channel my worries and fears into helping people who were experiencing the darkest moment of their lives. I met with families who had to prove that their loved one was in one of the buildings in cases where remains could not be found. Families shared the final moments with their loved ones with me, and I was honored to listen as they recounted their deepest despair. It was wearying work but also one of the most gratifying things I have done in my career.\n\nBill Guernier\n\nSarasota\n\nI had started a new job a week or two before with a consulting firm. That day was my first day in temporary shared office space. I was going out the door to go buy some office supplies and walked through the office lobby just after the first plane hit. Several people were watching the replay and told me what had happened. I had so much on my mind, it didn’t really register and I continued to the elevator to run my errand. By the time I got outside, I realized what had happened and I went back upstairs and saw the second plane hit.\n\nI got my briefcase and headed to Grand Central Terminal to try to get a train home to Chappaqua, N.Y. Outside I could see the smoke. At Grand Central most trains were canceled, but there was a train running on my line, the Harlem Line. It was packed and everyone was silent. After a few minutes there was an announcement to evacuate Grand Central immediately, the fear being that it could be attacked next. People didn’t panic but everyone moved quickly. I headed out and ran into a friend from town. We went to his office. He got through on his cell phone to his wife, who then called mine to tell her we were safe.\n\nWe left that building and started walking north, collecting two more friends from town along the way. We were up in the 90s, planning to walk to 125th Street to see if the trains were running from there. A limo driver heading into Midtown saw us and offered to take us home at the very premium price of $500. I think we surprised him by quickly accepting his offer without negotiation and jumped in. On the way we realized we barely had enough cash among us, but we scraped it together. He dropped us off at the Chappaqua train station. As I walked the short walk to my house, halfway there I sat down on the sidewalk for 10 minutes to process what had happened. I walked the rest of the way home, hugged my family and burst into tears. It all seems like yesterday.\n\nCapt. Mike Collette, Ret.\n\nNokomis\n\nOn 9/11 I was an active fire captain with the North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue Department in North Jersey. I remember speaking on my phone with a fellow firefighter watching the north tower burning and thinking \"Wow these guys in New York are going to bust their butts going up the stairs.\" Then the second plane hit the south tower. I'm thinking now something is not right here.\n\nThe next day we were deployed (all volunteers). My job was to keep my guys together and safe. I remember going through the empty Lincoln Tunnel and then being cheered on by everyone on Westside Hwy.\n\nAt Ground Zero we went to \"the well\" with buckets to help remove the debris. There were people from all over the United States including construction workers (the unsung heroes). They were so respectful to all the firefighters and police. As it turned out there were just too many people and it started getting to dangerous, steel beams flying around, cranes moving back and forth and myself ducking from the moving beams, the debris was over 100 feet high. I know of all of the firefighters that were there, it wasn't because they had to be, it was because they wanted to be. We will never forget the 343 firefighters, 37 Port Authority and New York policemen, plus the 2,000 civilians that that lost their lives that day.\n\nI will always remember thinking, “What a great country we have with everyone coming together.”\n\nWhat happened?\n\nEllen McKeefe\n\nSarasota\n\nA small group of freelance television news camera operators, audio techs and I, an experienced television news producer, huddled together at the old Broadway restaurant in Sarasota making plans to drive to Washington or New York for work. Clearly, after the terrorist attacks that morning we would have no work here for a very long time. No planes were flying anywhere so we decided to share vans and hit the road the next day.\n\nA few hours later, around 4 a.m. on September 12 my landline rang and ABC News in New York asked how far I was from Venice. I told them I could be there in a half hour or so. I was given a residential address and the name Mohammed Atta. I was instructed to meet a St. Petersburg freelance camera crew that I knew well, park with lights off a few doors away and look for FBI guys at that address. Minutes after we parked, several vehicles pulled up and there they were. About a dozen FBI guys in the navy blue jackets with yellow lettering. Camera rolling we approached. The FBI operatives were not amused but knew we had every right to tape the action from a perimeter they quickly established. We were the only news people there. It was quickly determined that no one named Atta lived there. I learned later that morning that Atta was the leader of the terrorist pilots. Atta had piloted the first passenger jet into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.\n\nThe crew and I were in the midst of the most important story we would ever cover and we knew it instantly. I spent the following two weeks at Huffmann Aviation at the Venice Airport where Atta and Marwan al Shehhi trained; al Shehhi was the pilot who flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. I organized and managed an instant field production operation at Huffman Aviation which became a major component of a major and historic worldwide news story. I did interviews with people who knew both men. Some had trained them to fly. I managed satellite truck live shots into Good Morning America, World News Tonight, Nightline and 20-20. During subsequent weeks, I was an investigative reporter, no camera crew, just a dogged journalist tracing Atta and al Shehhi’s steps as they lived among us in 2000-01.\n\nOver four decades, my television news career took me all over the world covering major stories. Nothing approaches my small part covering the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. It remains my most significant professional accomplishment. And, yes, I would do it all over again.\n\nRobert Bourlier\n\nLakewood Ranch\n\nAt 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001 I was on the flight deck of a United B-757 in Providence, R.I. requesting a clearance to O’Hare in Chicago when I was informed that all airplanes on the east coast were grounded. On the previous Saturday, Sept. 8, I had piloted a flight to Phoenix returning on that Sunday. My first class flight attendant had been CeeCee Lyles. I learned that day that she was on United flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, PA. I will never forget!\n\nEleanor Schmidt\n\nSarasota\n\nI emerged from the subway a little before 9 a.m. on that day and saw a ring of fire around the first tower, stood in disbelief and then heard a loud crash, the second tower was hit. Everyone ran east and north to escape any fallout. I lost 84 coworkers at Fiduciary Trust Company and my husband thought I was dead until I found a public phone at 9:30 a.m. I walked home to East 76th Street, a neighborhood where doctors in white who came into the city to help in the hospitals found no bodies were being delivered. There were no bodies. Days were spent by employees of Fiduciary attending so many funerals, and finally a special Mass was held at the famous cathedral on the Upper West Side. It was a sobering time. Two years later I retired and moved to Sarasota for happier days.\n\nZoe Marshall\n\nNokomis\n\nThis is the partial text of an email sent to friends on 9/11/01:\n\nI cannot begin to tell you my story. I too am in such shock over all this. But I feel I became a part of history that day. Bush was at one of our schools at the time all this happened. I had volunteered to man the front office while all the staff and a few students gathered in the media center to see him. We were incredibly excited and preparations began the Friday before. Much security had taken place before his arrival. Bush’s limo stopped right in front of my office, so I got to see him greet our Superintendent and several other big wigs. The plan was he was to observe a classroom teaching lesson, then on to the media center to promote his new reading initiative. Right after he entered the classroom, I got a call from a parent telling me we better turn on the TV as a plane had hit the World Trade Center.\n\nAt this point, I was in the front office with about 10 Secret Service, the sheriff, and head of the fire department. We all turned to the TV and were amazed to watch what we thought was a horrible accident. Then as we were watching, the second plane hit the other tower. At that point, the Secret Service went into action/panic mode that was unbelievable. All of the sudden, they were EVERYwhere. Then Bush came on the TV live (remember, he is the building right behind me) stating that he had just been advised we were under terrorist attack and would have to leave right away.\n\nAbout five minutes later, he came walking through the passageway, sort of alone, as the Secret Service were following about 2-3 feet behind. His shoulders were slumped and he had this incredible sad look on his face. I was at the window and all of the sudden he looked up and saw me, and gave a small wave. I swear he looked right in my eyes, and I sadly gave a small wave back. Later that night, I realized I was probably the last civilian to see him before he was whisked away into hiding. I will never forget it. His eyes were SO sad.\n\nLynn Nemser\n\nVenice\n\nI was on my way back home to Pittsburgh from London when our flight was diverted to a small airport in Stephenville, Newfoundland. Gander was already full. After 18 hours on the plane, we deplaned and registered with Canadian Red Cross in the small airport lobby. They were the first to welcome us as we realized we were registering as refugees. As an American, that was something I never thought I would be.\n\nSince the town had run out of places for us to stay, we were bused about an hour north to the Camp of the Silver Birches, a Salvation Army youth camp that had closed for the season. We were met by the Salvation Army members who left their jobs and closed their businesses that day to welcome us again. They provided us with lodging, clothes phone access and ample, delicious meals until we left a few days later. They even brought in an Irish Band to lift our spirits!\n\nMike Shlasko\n\nNokomis\n\nI got a call from one of my business partners working with NYPD on the recovery operation. They asked me to meet them at the NYPD’s new Emergency Operations Center (EOC). I put on my suit, American flag pin in my lapel, and headed to the west side where I found, in a sprawling warehouse, dozens of technology companies working to bring the new EOC to life. Beside me was a wall of Krispy Kreme donuts donated in memory of their shop lost in the WTC collapse.\n\nI picked up my phone to call and ask where my partner was, and I was interrupted by another gentleman in a suit who asked, “Are you in charge here?” I suppose as the only one in a suit that was a natural conclusion to draw. I said, “No, I have no idea who is in charge.” Then he said, “I’m here with the mayor” and in struts Rudy Giuliani and his entourage, there to inspect the new facility. That was the first time I’d met Rudy, strutting like a peacock back then, and still now.\n\nSusan \"Sky\" Makara\n\nSarasota\n\nI am an artist.\n\nThat morning every road was bumper to bumper crawling away from the Pentagon. Mine was the only car driving towards the devastation, the same direction as my studio. I had an overwhelming urge to get to my studio. Painting is my sanctuary, It helps me process trauma. When I arrived, I could smell the jet fuel and see the Pentagon’s pillar of smoke from my studio window in the Torpedo Factory Art Center. The streets were full of military personnel and equipment. Fighter jets were overhead. Nearby National Airport would be closed for weeks.\n\nMy studio remained open to the public. Stranded visitors from all over continued to come in. They were living out of their suitcases, which made for unusual and sometimes entertaining attire. As I talked with them I began to realize my feelings of inadequacy at being useless in this horrific situation were unwarranted. It helped to hear that my paintings were giving these traumatized people something beautiful to see, and I was honored to be thanked over and over by so many. Painting is my medicine and I am grateful that I can share it.\n\nDiana Berry\n\nRetired Director of Quality Assurance at SunCoast Blood Center\n\nSarasota\n\nOn 9/11, I was working at our local blood bank on Mound Street as an Education Specialist. I had just finished our annual employee training when two people burst in the room and shouted, “A plane just hit the World Trade Center and caused a tower to collapse!” We couldn’t believe what we were hearing as we hurried downstairs to the donor room to watch the TV hanging from the wall. With horror and awe, we saw the second tower collapse and were speechless.\n\nWithin 45 minutes blood donors started appearing at the front door to our building. Fifteen minutes later the front lobby was filled with donors clamoring to donate blood. President Bush was on air urging people to go and donate blood. Soon our parking lot was swamped with cars. Potential donors were lined up out the door and down the street. Volunteers were directing traffic. Employees stepped up to the plate, screening donors and drawing blood. Lab employees processed and tested the blood, ensuring its safety. Local restaurants sent food to feed everyone. Such a phenomenal spirit was present that day and the dark days that followed 9/11 as hundreds of generous blood donors and employees came together to help the fallen.\n\nRichard Morgan\n\nBradenton\n\n\n\nSeptember 11 was a beautiful sunny morning in Shannon, Ireland. My two sons and I had completed a 12-day golfing trip all around Ireland as we boarded Delta flight 129 bound for Atlanta (we thought) connecting on to home in Sarasota. Our brand new Boeing 767 was full, mostly American tourists heading home and Irish families headed for Disney World on vacation. Our crew were seasoned old timers on that route and the captain was commanding his final flight after a long and distinguished career. Surprise for all -- halfway across the Atlantic, our plane was diverted to Newfoundland.\n\nWe were the last of 37 international flights to land at Gander that day (over 12,000 people). That put us at the end of a very long line for everything -- the food and water truck, the bathroom emptying truck, the information dissemination about the terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Mountie visits to the plane, and after 24 hours locked tight on the ground, at last the wheeled exit ramp that barely reached the door. Off we went with carry-ons only by school bus for 70 miles to the tiny fishing town of Lewisporte to spend three days and nights. Three plane loads of strangers who had \"Come from Away\" suddenly grew that town's population by a third in an instant. Boy, did the Newfies handle it well.\n\nThe townspeople fed us, bedded us, took us into their homes and social clubs, entertained us, cared for our needs, and would not take a dime from us. The only thing we paid for was beer at the two main street taverns, which both ran dry for a while. We even drank the rum and kissed the cod as they \"screeched\" us in as honorary Newfies -- what an honor. We will never again meet people as hospitable and friendly as our emergency hosts in Newfoundland. I thank them again every chance I get.\n\nThere is no way I can ever fully thank the Salvation Army members, the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadians for their compassionate care of all of us.\n\nLinda Haller Sloan\n\nSarasota\n\nOn September 11, 2001, my close friend Karen and I were telecommunications attorneys in Washington, D.C.\n\nWe had business trip flights out of Dulles International Airport. Karen was headed to Los Angeles, me to Asia. As I was about to catch a taxi to the airport, news broke that two planes had hit the Twin Towers in New York.\n\nFour planes went down that morning. Karen’s husband, friends and I gathered at her house that afternoon. It wasn’t until hours later we learned Karen’s plane had hit the Pentagon. American Airlines Flight #77. My dear friend -- young, bright, marathon runner, writer, law firm partner, family-oriented Iowan of strength and innocence - was smoldering in the ashes.\n\nI was devastated about Karen. I struggled to understand how our country could have been attacked. I worried desperately how my twin sister would get home. She was in Brussels at a conference with 200 fellow Americans.\n\nAfter 9/11, many Americans answered the call. The Federal Communications Commission where I worked established a Homeland Security Policy Council. I joined it, and later, the White House, to do homeland security work.\n\nHonoring the fallen, and protecting our democracy, must never die.\n\nMike Eisgrau\n\nEnglewood\n\nIn 2001 I was Director of Public Affairs for New York’s giant Jacob K. Javits Convention Center --- handling the press and being spokesman for the Center on Manhattan’s west side. My office was eight minutes from Ground Zero --- and within hours we became the major emergency disaster relief center, the staging area for what you saw on your TV screens and heard on your radios for the first five weeks of that disaster.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive memory I have of those days is of those who volunteered. When Governor Pataki designated Javits as the Volunteer Coordination Center the outpouring of support was phenomenal. Thousands lined up on the street to fill out forms with their names, contact information and job skills -- then waited patiently for hours for us to register them.\n\nAnd talk about donations! They came in literally by the ton -- from crowbars to can openers, from aspirin to antibiotic cream to ACE bandages, from hard hats to Handi-wipes, from work boots to dog booties (for the police canine units) and dog food. They came by truck and car and bicycle and on foot---everybody was running to give something.\n\nOne huge trailer truck came from a small town in Michigan. It was driven by a husband and wife team who said simply that their townspeople had contributed what they could to help out the folks in New York. More than 50 state troopers and Javits labor staff formed a human chain to unload the truck.\n\nAnd then they left. No one can remember the names of that couple, or their hometown. But everyone there remembered them simply as Americans helping out in a time of need.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/22/homes/us-home-prices-falling/index.html", "title": "Home prices are finally falling. But how low will they go? | CNN ...", "text": "The US housing market is in the midst of a major shift. After two years of stratospheric price appreciation, home prices have peaked and are on their way back down.\n\nBut what homebuyers and homeowners alike want to know is: How much lower will prices go?\n\nThe short answer: Prices are likely to drop further, but not by as much as they did during the housing bust. From the 2006 peak to the 2012 trough, national home prices fell by 27%, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which measures US home prices.\n\n“It was different in 2008, 2009 because that drop in prices was because of a push from sellers,” said Jeff Tucker, senior economist at Zillow. “Because of foreclosures and short sales there were a lot of extremely motivated sellers who were willing to take a loss on their homes.”\n\nPlus, that housing crash came at a time when the inventory of homes for sale was four times higher than it is now. Current inventory is still substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels, which has increased competition for homes. And that is keeping prices relatively strong.\n\n“I would be surprised to see prices anywhere drop below where they were in 2019,” said Tucker. “There was some overheating in the housing market in 2021 through this spring that pushed prices higher than what the fundamentals would support. Now they are coming down.”\n\nHow low will prices go?\n\nWith mortgage rates more than doubling since the start of this year, the calculations for a homebuyer have changed considerably. The monthly principal and interest mortgage payment on the median priced home is up $930 from a year ago, a 73% increase, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n\nWhen you factor in soaring mortgage rates, along with elevated home prices and wages that aren’t increasing as fast, buying a home is less affordable now than it has been in decades, according to Black Knight.\n\nBut there may be some relief in sight for buyers.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs expect home prices to decline by around 5% to 10% from the peak hit in June.\n\nWells Fargo has recently forecasted that national median single-family home prices will drop by 5.5% year-over-year by the end of 2023.\n\nWells Fargo’s economists estimate that the median price for an existing single family home to be $385,000 this year, up 7.8% from last year, but the growth will be a lot less than the 19% year-over-year increase seen in 2021.\n\nThe economists anticipate the median home price will fall to $364,000, a decline of 5.5% from this year. They predict prices will rebound and rise again in 2024, with the median price ticking up 3.3% to 376,000 by the end of 2024.\n\n“The primary driver behind the housing market correction thus far has been sharply higher mortgage rates,” the Wells Fargo researchers wrote. “If our forecast for Fed rate cuts is realized, mortgage rates are likely to fall slightly just as cooling inflation pressures boost real income growth. A modest improvement in sales activity should then follow, which will reignite home price appreciation heading into 2024.”\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nUltimately, how much prices fall will depend on where you live.\n\nUnlike the run-up in prices during the pandemic that caused home values in markets across the country to surge, the cooling off will be more regional, said Tucker. The drops will be more deeply felt in places where there were larger gains during the pandemic, many of them in the West and Sunbelt, including cities like Austin, Phoenix and Boise, he said.\n\n“Nationally, we might see a 5% decline from the peak,” Tucker said. “But prices will decline by more in the West and there will be a smaller decline in the Southeast.”\n\nIn September, month-over-month home prices dropped in several pandemic hotspots, including Phoenix, down 2.3%; Las Vegas, down 1.9% and Austin, down nearly 1%, according to Zillow.\n\nAnd Boise, Idaho, where prices surged nearly 60% during the pandemic, is already seeing annual declines, with prices falling 3.9% year over year in September, according to Zillow.\n\n“A number of metro areas, especially in the West, will see some year-over-year price declines this spring,” said Tucker. “That will be the worst comparison time because that’s when many markets reached their peak.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2017/04/19/high-desert-music-scene-exploding-and-nobody-knows/304658001/", "title": "High desert music scene is exploding and nobody knows it", "text": "Rick Shelley had a batch of songs unlike anything he had ever written.\n\nShelley, 50, was part of the low desert rock scene of the 1980s and ‘90s. He played with the jam band, Woodshed, and the Iggy Pop-influenced RagTag, featuring future Queens of the Stone Age bassist Nick Oliveri. But he had written some songs with a lonely weariness, like “Easy Lies” and “The Bed I Made,” singing like a forlorn guy who has benignly accepted his fate.\n\nShelley went to a well-known Palm Springs studio where many of his low desert colleagues, and even Doors guitarist Robby Krieger record. The owner-engineer liked his material but he wanted studio musicians to record the tracks and let Shelley lay down the vocals. It’s the way most major studios work. It didn’t feel right to Shelley. Not for those organic songs.\n\nA friend told him about a new studio off a dirt road in northern Joshua Tree called High Lonesome. It’s owned by Georgia native Chris Unck, who is playing in the Joshua Tree Music Festival next month and has also recorded with a group called Adobe Collective. Unck welcomed Shelley like a guy offering water to man lost in the desert.\n\n“The atmosphere of the place was unassuming and comfortable,” Shelley said. “It felt like I do when I’m at home. I knew instantaneously, ‘I’m going to record here.’”\n\nShelley recorded an EP and then an album released in February titled “Hope Wrapped in Razor Wire.” Both received CV Music Award nominations.\n\nINTRO:High desert, east valley music scenes are in full bloom\n\nThe singer-guitarist knows Joshua Tree's mystique. Woodshed recorded at Rancho de la Luna, a Joshua Tree studio made famous by the recordings of Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, and played GramFest: The Cosmic American Music Festival that saluted Gram Parsons annually from 1997 to 2006. He credits the quiet, embracing high desert culture for helping to bring his musical ideas to fruition.\n\n“The songs were written down here,” he said. “But I don’t know if (they) would have been realized in any other place with any other group of people. It came together magically with the right players at the right time.”\n\nMusicians have been moving to the high desert region of Morongo Valley to Twentynine Palms in gold rush fashion the past few years to mine its mystique. Barnett English, who has produced two Joshua Tree Music Festivals at the Joshua Tree Lake Campground since 2003, says there are 35 to 40 recording studios in the area.\n\nThe studios range from small home studios owned by the likes of Gram Rabbit co-founders Todd Rutherford and Jesika von Rabbit, and Masters of Reality leader and Queens of the Stone Age producer Chris Goss, to high grade studios owned by classical composer Jarrod Radnich, and the Pink Satellite studio owned by Motocross champion Chris Haines and operated by Queen music director Spike Edney.\n\nEdney’s primary home is England, but he’s had a small house in Joshua Tree since 2004. He says a gravitational pull draws him and other musicians to the high desert.\n\n“I’ve always wondered what it is that makes me want to come back here and think about it while I’m away,” Edney said inside his studio. “There is a magnetism and whether it’s a real, actual magnetism or whether it’s something imagined… We had some guests that came out here, musicians, and one of the wives stood looking out across the desert and said, ‘There’s something here that when you look out and see this view and breathe this air, it makes you feel that anything is possible.’ I think when you’re up here and you’re looking for creativity, you can find it.”\n\nMORE MUSIC:20 albums to discover the high desert sound\n\nSpiritual legacy\n\nArtists, musicians and philosophers have long been drawn to the area.\n\nEdwin John Dingle, one of the first Westerners to study at a monastery in Tibet, founded the Institute of Mentalphysics (now the Joshua Tree Retreat Center) in Joshua Tree in 1941, at age 60, after saying he was spiritually guided to an energy vortex on Highway 62. Frank Lloyd Wright designed Dingle’s Joshua Tree home and his son, Lloyd Wright, completed the surrounding compound.\n\nArtists and expatriate movie studio “seekers” studied Dingle’s Science of Mentalphysics, espousing “the oneness of life embodied in all substance, energy and thought.” It was far from a narrow religious cult. Its metaphysical book store also sold Robert Collier’s volumes of “Secrets of the Ages” and Emmet Fox’s “Power Through Constructive Thinking.”\n\nMany of those same retired Hollywood actors, directors and producers built the Hi-Desert Cultural Center in 1964, incorporating it as a nonprofit in 1967 to promote “dramatic, musical, visual, and other forms of artistic expression.”\n\nA new generation of entertainers and spiritual seekers began arriving in the 1960s. The late Ted Markland, a co-star of “The High Chaparral” from 1967-‘69, was attracted to the high desert by a series of UFO conventions at the Integratron in Landers, built by former aircraft mechanic George Van Tassel after reportedly receiving telepathic instructions from Venus.\n\nMarkland was friends with a Chumash medicine man he knew from Hollywood named Grandfather Semu Huaute. He had participated in Indian peyote rituals since the late 1950s and studied the teachings of the 11th century Tibetan Buddhist, Milarepa.\n\nHe found a hill on the Yucca Valley side of the then-Joshua Tree National Monument where he had a series of metaphysical experiences. He began taking show biz friends to his hill to “hear the voice of God.” In 1967, he hosted the wedding of LSD guru Timothy Leary in that section of the Monument, and LSD was consumed liberally.\n\nAmong the celebrities Markland accompanied to Joshua Tree were Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and Gram Parsons of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers. Markland said in 2006, “I can’t figure what the big thing about Gram was. He was just a singer. He OD’d on drugs.”\n\nHe overdosed in the Joshua Tree Inn in 1973, but, rather than let his family bury him, his friend and tour manager, Phil Kaufman, honored a pact they made to scatter his ashes in Joshua Tree National Monument. He stole the coffin containing Parson's body at Los Angeles International Airport before it could be shipped to his family home in Louisiana. Then he took it to the Monument and set it on fire at Cap Rock. His actions became so legendary, it was made into a 2003 movie titled “Grand Theft Parsons.”\n\nVON RABBIT:High desert hurdle may now give music priestess a lift\n\nArtists from The Doors and the Eagles to “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels took psychedelics, such as magic mushrooms, in Joshua Tree in the 1960s and '70s. But the working musicians and artists moved to the area more gradually.\n\nBritish folk-rock singer Donovan took a break from his career to raise his family there in the 1980s. Jim Yester, who sang the lead on “Along Comes Mary” with the Association, also bought a Joshua Tree home that decade. Victoria Williams and “King of Surf Guitar” Dick Dale moved to the high desert around 1990. Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Markland friend Eric Burdon, who had lived in the low desert since the 1960s, bought a house there in the early 2000s.\n\nWhen asked why psychedelics were so popular in the desert, Burdon said, \"It's easier to find God there than on Van Nuys Boulevard.\"\n\nMusical migration\n\nToday, the high desert is filled with working musicians. English said he’s featuring more local artists than ever at his festival next month with nine. He had previously averaged five to seven local musicians at that global festival and his roots festival in October.\n\n“I’d like to make more room because there are just so many,” he said. “The town has slowly been attracting artists over time and now it’s reached the point, ‘Hey, look around, there’s a lot. It’s not just Eric Burdon and Victoria Williams, who were here 20 years ago. It’s really become a thick scene.\n\n“People say, ‘What’s a big music town?’ and people say, Brooklyn and Portland, Austin and Seattle. But this definitely has something unique. If you consider the ratio of the population to the number of artists, our ratio is way higher.”\n\nRancho de la Luna owner Dave Catching was so busy when Shelley was looking for a studio, it inspired him to go to High Lonesome. Catching had been recording major acts like the Arctic Monkeys, the Hives, Unkle and Mark Lanegan since the late 1990s when Homme organized some jam sessions with studio founder Fred Drake known as the Desert Sessions.\n\n“Josh was a huge fan of Fred’s drumming – and of Fred – so he would come up and record with Fred,” said Catching, a guitarist with Eagles of Death Metal and Earthlings¿. “We started with people we knew and then it started growing to outside people. That definitely helped the studio. I think that’s why 95 percent of the people drawn here want to record here – because of Josh’s involvement.”\n\nJOSH HOMME AND JESSE HUGHES: Not letting Paris define them\n\nNow the Rancho is attracting international artists.\n\n“I just had a band from Norway called Motorpscyho,” Catching said. “The bass player has a country band called Sugarfoot and they just finished their second album here in January.”\n\nBritish musician Rocco Gardner recorded an album with Catching in 2012. He became so infatuated with the area, he bought a house on 40 acres near Pappy and Harriet’s and recently bought another 100 acres. He unveiled his Rancho V studio last year and added Airstream trailers for visiting recording artists. Chris Thorn of Blind Melon and Peaches are among the artists he’s recorded there.\n\n“When I first came here (in 2004), or even when I bought the ranch, it was just kind of rock and roll,” Gardner said. “It was Catching, Queens of the Stone Age and those guys. That’s what grabbed me about it. Then there was this sort of hipster arrival.\n\n“I have no negative feelings about more people arriving. La Copine (Kitchen) is getting reviewed nationally. When you see 40 people standing outside a café on Old Woman Springs Road at 9 o’clock in the morning, all looking quite trendy, you know it’s happening.\"\n\nUnck, Edney, Catching and Gardner all have studios accessible only by dirt roads. That's one of the attractions of having recording studios in the middle of nowhere. There's no one around to complain about the noise.\n\nEdney said he didn’t get excited about Haines’ idea to build the Pink Satellite until he discovered how much talent there was in the region.\n\n“I keep being introduced (to musicians) by our good friend Bobby Furgo, who is a high desert icon, and his musical mate, Robbi Robb, who is a producer and a bandleader,” he said. “They have extensive connections with the known musicians and the lesser musicians. I’m quite intrigued by the lesser known musicians.”\n\nEdney served as a judge at the last two Tachevah Music Showcases at Pappy and Harriet’s to find musicians he might like to record at the Pink Satellite. But he’s discovering talent all over.\n\nREAD MORE:East valley is an incubator for young musicians\n\n“The quality and singing and musicianship is very inspiring,” he said. “We had a little showcase and eight or nine people I’d never heard of, and they could all sing and play really well. I’ve seen similar events where people cannot sing and play, even though they think they can.”\n\nFestival boom\n\nThe explosion of studios has corresponded with a growth of boutique music festivals. Jon McKinney, who founded GramFest, folded his three-day Parsons tribute in 2006 because he said his festival had brought attention to the country rock progenitor, but it was now, “promoting all the products for Sony and Warner Bros.”\n\nDavid Lowery, leader of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, started his Campout at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2005, featuring both bands and supporting acts like Gram Rabbit over a weekend in September. The Clean Air, Clean Skies Festival started at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2007 and, after a short hiatus, returned as the Desert Stars Festival, specializing in the psychedelic sound that is part of the high desert heritage. Its headliners included Krieger, the Dandy Warhols and Dinosaur Jr.*\n\nThe Joshua Tree Retreat Center, which had long produced retreats with speakers such as reincarnation advocate Shirley MacLaine, began promoting Eastern spiritual-oriented music and yoga festivals with its first Bhakti Fest in September 2009. Then it presented the female-focused Shakti Fest in May 2011, a UFO convention called Contact in the Desert and a “flow art” retreat fueled by fire games called the IgNght Conference in 2013. Earlier this month, a Sam Nam Fest focused on music and healing.\n\nThe Retreat Center expanded in a more secular direction last year with an event billed as a spiritual concert by hip-hop star Childish Gambino. The much-lauded Desert Daze Festival followed with diverse rockers including Primus, Television and Deerhunter.\n\nThe dizzying pace has required some adjustment for long-time residents like von Rabbit.\n\n“I’ve definitely seen this place get a lot more trendy,” she said. “I sound like a real old person: ‘Who are these kids coming in here?’ I have to catch myself. ‘Jesika, you sound like the people who own the farm by Woodstock.’ But you want to keep that little secret to yourself.”\n\nTHE TRIBESMEN:This east valley instrumental band does not need a vocalist\n\nTerry Taylor-Castillo, interim director of the Joshua Tree Retreat Center, said it may slow down a bit. The Childish Gambino concert was “a unique situation,” she said, and, “I don’t see that happening again.”\n\nIt may have been spiritual, but it provoked controversy in Joshua Tree. English said it was a bad fit for the area.\n\n“I think because of where the Retreat Center is,” he said. “It’s located right on the highway and there’s a neighborhood across the street with quite a few houses. So, to have outdoor music there past midnight really is a square peg in a round hole. They (also) ended up grading like three acres of supposedly protected desert land, and that just got everybody up in arms.”\n\nThe Desert Daze promoters have a contract for another fall festival at the Retreat Center, but Taylor-Castillo said, “It’s not something we really want to concentrate on in the future.”\n\nThe center is now reassessing its direction after parting company with executive director Victoria Gevoian. Taylor-Castillo said she’d like to have more community events with local musicians, but only spiritually-focused big events.\n\n“We are bringing in some new things, but they’re mostly like yoga retreats, shamanistic things, cleanses, personal growth, silent retreats,” said Taylor-Castillo, who runs the Taylor Junction art gallery in Joshua Tree in addition to serving on the Retreat Center board. “I really don’t see that our future will be (secular) music festivals.”\n\nThe Joshua Tree Lake Campground, which is now preparing for the May 18 Joshua Tree Music Festival, also has expanded its offering. It recently hosted a nudity-allowed “adult carnival” for the L.A. League of Arts, an organization associated with Burning Man that produces the Burning Man Decompression Arts and Music Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nSally Jayes, co-owner of the campground with her husband, Ken, was on the Joshua Tree Chamber of Commerce from the late 1990s to 2003-’04, and she says the chamber laid out a welcome mat for musicians and artists then.\n\n“I got off because the chamber was there for commerce, for business,” she said, “and the people that were there wanted to move to art. That’s fine for downtown, but it’s not commerce.”\n\nGenie out of the bottle*\n\nRobyn Celia and Linda Krantz recall the high desert as “a completely different animal in 2003.”\n\nCelia was performing in a New York rock band called Lava Baby in the 1990s and Krantz was a props mistress in the film industry. Krantz stayed at the Pioneertown Hotel and went back to New York and told Celia about this crazy saloon, called Pappy and Harriet’s, built as a movie set for cowboy actors back in 1946. Celia and Krantz bought it in 2003 with their credit cards.\n\n“When I came out here, (the music community) was only one family; everybody knew each other,” Celia said. “At that time at Pappy’s, everybody wanted country music. It took us a really long time to not get the phone calls, like, ‘Is it country? Oh, God, it’s not?’ Now my best nights are if (Seattle grunge progenitors) the Melvins are playing.”*\n\nThis is Pappy's busiest time of the year with Coachella bands playing sold-out shows between its two weekends. But Pappy's also has presented Robert Plant, attracted by a Wanda Jackson show, crooner Rufus Wainwright playing a cabaret show and, of course, Paul McCartney performing between Desert Trip shows last October.\n\nCelia says the rapid high desert growth began with the recession.\n\n“When everybody else was panicking, I feel this area exploded because people couldn’t afford to go overseas or couldn’t afford to take an expensive vacation,” she said. “So they started to discover this area. It all happened at the same time. When people discovered Pappy’s, they discovered the Integratron and the park. If you look at the park’s numbers each year, it’s amazing.”\n\nDESERT MAG: High desert artists shift a growing music scene\n\nLike Pappy’s, you can’t just roll up to Joshua Tree National Park and expect to get into a campsite anymore. The park set an attendance record with 2 million visitors in 2015, and then drew 500,000 more in 2016. Now it’s encouraging visitors to reserve private sites out of the park.\n\nThe Joshua Tree Music Festival also sets new attendance records every year, but last year it had its biggest jump ever – up more than 12 percent to 4,100 people. English says he’ll cap attendance at 4,500.\n\n“To be honest, that size would allow us to still keep the ticket price reasonable,\" he said. \"We could produce a really nice show and you and I could still run into each other instead of having to text. I don’t want to be in the business of running a big show because then I’m just in the port-a-(potty) and security business.”\n\nHidden scene\n\nDespite the rapid growth at Joshua Tree National Park and Pappy and Harriet’s, the music scene in between remains relatively invisible to outsiders. Pete Stahl, who began recording at Rancho de la Luna in the mid-1990s and then introduced his former Washington D.C. bandmate, Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl, to the studio in 1997, says he gets the same feeling coming to Joshua Tree from L.A. that he did 25 years ago.\n\n“It still feels the same to me,” said Stahl, who had driven in for a session with the Earthlings¿. “Obviously there are more people coming in and out of the park, but it still feels special. There’s a certain quietness to the desert and a light, and that’s the same. It’s that kind of magical atmosphere that is attractive.”\n\n“For me, it’s quiet there and when I go, it’s not busy,” said Shelley. “Where Chris (Unck)’s place is, it’s out in the middle of nowhere. So you can let yourself dig into your thoughts a little bit deeper than maybe you would with a lot of the stimulus you might get in the city. And it is a beautiful place.”\n\nEven the musicians who live there are so isolated, they aren’t aware of all the local studios or even some significant musicians in the community. Edney praised Ted Quinn for being “a magnet for aspiring musicians of all ages and all genres” with his Tuesday open mic night at the Joshua Tree Saloon and online radio show from the Joshua Tree Lounge, where he recorded his recent album, “1.11” live – before doing overdubs at Jamie Hafler’s Ghost of Future Records studio in Joshua Tree.\n\nCatching had no idea how many other studios there were in the high desert. He said he doesn’t go out much in Joshua Tree because he’s either recording or decompressing from a tour. English said that’s typical of the working musicians.\n\n“Most people are very independent, DIY-type of people anyway,” he said. “That’s why they’re out here in the middle of nowhere with their own studio. So, people could be up here for years and not know someone that lives up on the other side of the rocks.”\n\nVon Rabbit hadn’t heard of Radnich, the 34-year-old president and chairman of the Hi-Desert Cultural Center, founder of the Joshua Tree Philharmonic, and an internationally known classical composer and pianist who has appeared on NBC’s “The Today Show.”\n\nRADNICH ON PIANO: See him play music from 'Pirates of Caribbean'\n\nRadnich, a Joshua Tree native, isn't surprised that there's a whole community of musicians who don't know each or realize how many studios there are in Joshua Tree.\n\n“There really is a dichotomy in the Joshua Tree music scene,” he said, “and, in fact, that name says a lot. There’s the scene with those who perform locally or semi-locally, and whose music income is driven by live entertainment – where one needs to literally be seen by your audience – and then there are industry professionals who produce product not dependent on live performance, but who have products that have captured a global market.

Kansas voters rejected an amendment that would have removed the right to an abortion from the state’s constitution. This is the first time citizens have been able to weigh in on the issue at the polls since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the high turnout in Kansas could be a sign that voters will continue to show up to make their disagreement known. In Missouri, disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens lost his Republican primary after a controversial attempt to reenter politics. Several election deniers backed by former President Donald Trump were on the ballot in Arizona, Michigan and Washington. Some of these races are still too close to call, but Trump-backed Tudor Dixon is projected to become Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s challenger in November.\n\n2.

This comes as Ukraine’s military has warned that Russian forces are preparing for renewed assaults on cities in the Donetsk region still controlled by Kyiv after taking over Lysychansk – the final city to fall in the Luhansk region.

The effort had such lofty goals as providing financial services to the underbanked and extending the social media company’s mission of connecting the world into the burgeoning market for digital money.\n\nLibra was originally slated to launch within less than a year. Two and a half years later, the project — renamed Diem last year — has officially unraveled after various setbacks and regulatory pressure made it impossible to get off the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the Facebook-backed Diem Association announced it would dissolve and sell off the intellectual property and other assets related to running its planned cryptocurrency network to Silvergate Capital Corporation, in a deal valued at $182 million. The Diem Association expects to begin “winding down” in the coming weeks, according to the announcement.\n\nThe project was dogged from the start by concerns from regulators, lawmakers and other financial services industry watchers about a cryptocurrency run by Facebook (now called Meta), which has struggled to prevent issues such as crime and abuses of user data on its existing platforms. And Diem’s end is a sign that regulators, who have explored a range of ways to crack down on Meta but have yet to act on much of it, do hold some sway over the tech giant and its ability to expand into new product areas.\n\n“Despite giving us positive substantive feedback on the design of the network, it nevertheless became clear from our dialogue with federal regulators that the project could not move ahead,” Diem Association CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement Monday. He added that the group believes its work on Diem will inform future projects that could “deliver the benefits that motivated the Diem Association from the beginning.”\n\nSilvergate plans to use the Diem assets to continue investing in building a stablecoin and a global payments network built on the blockchain, the company said in a statement.\n\nComplicated from the start\n\nWhen Facebook announced Libra, the plan was to create a universal cryptocurrency that could be accessed by digital wallets — all of which would be built on the blockchain, the technology that underpins other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. In theory, that could make it cheaper and easier to send money and pay for things anywhere in the world. Libra, it said, would be backed by a reserve of fiat currencies, such as the dollar and euro, to help prevent the volatility that has plagued other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe structure and governance of the project was complicated from the get-go, which likely didn’t help garner regulatory support. Though Facebook (FB) launched the project, the company said it would not govern Libra and its reserve; that duty would fall to the Switzerland-based Libra Association, a group initially comprised of more than two-dozen companies and nonprofits that included Facebook (FB) but also PayPal (PYPL), Lyft (LYFT) and others. Facebook (FB) started an internal unit called Calibra, which was to create a digital wallet that people could connect to using their Facebook (FB) accounts to send and receive Libra. But it also said other companies would be able to create Libra wallets.\n\nRegulators and lawmakers in the United States and elsewhere were almost immediately suspicious of a new currency that would be available to Facebook’s billions of users at a time when most countries lack the regulatory infrastructure to effectively oversee digital money. They worried that Libra could threaten national currencies like the US dollar and financial markets, and that it could enable cybercrimes and compromise user privacy. They also worried that the project could give Facebook even more power.\n\n“We need to get the message loud and clear to [Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark] Zuckerberg that he’s not a country on his own and he cannot always have it his way,” Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told reporters months after the project was introduced. Some of the Libra Association’s founding partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, pulled out of the project as regulatory scrutiny ramped up.\n\nHearings, name changes and a key executive departure\n\nFacebook and members of the Libra Association made efforts to engage with regulators, including in Congressional hearings, and made promises to comply with US anti-money laundering and “know your customer” laws, as banks must.\n\nIn his statement Monday, Diem’s Levey said the project had “evolved substantially and improved” as a result of feedback from regulators and governments around the world.\n\nStill, the project dragged on with limited progress. In May 2020, Facebook renamed the Calibra payments unit to “Novi.” About six months later, the Libra Association rebranded as “Diem” to reflect a new, scaled back nature — the coin would now be backed only by the US dollar — and an attempt to distance the effort from Facebook’s early flop in announcing Libra.\n\nIn October 2021, Facebook launched a pilot of its Novi digital wallet, but without Diem. Users could instead send and receive a different digital coin. Shortly after, David Marcus, the leader of Novi who had spearheaded the Libra project, left the company to pursue other projects.\n\nMarcus hinted at the role Facebook’s tainted reputation may have played in the project’s demise in a series of tweets Monday.\n\n“We gave our whole hearts, blood, sweat and tears to what I will always call Libra,” Marcus said. “We were mission driven and in it for the right reasons (that remain as valid today as they were then). Here’s to yet another chapter with a maybe more ‘acceptable’ promoter driving the vision forward.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/tech/europe-digital-markets-act-consumer-impacts/index.html", "title": "How Europe's bold new rules for Big Tech could change the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nApple users could soon install apps outside the App Store. WhatsApp users could message or video call friends using Telegram, and vice versa. And the search results users see on Google could change, with potentially major repercussions for smaller online businesses.\n\nThese are just some of the changes that could come about for consumers from new landmark legislation unveiled by European lawmakers last week that aims to bolster competition in online services. By imposing new regulations on technology platforms deemed to be dominant “gatekeepers,” the Digital Markets Act (DMA) could result in sweeping changes to how EU citizens — and potentially consumers around the world — interact with major tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL GOOGLE) and Facebook (FB) parent company Meta.\n\nRegulators in several countries have proposed new rules to rein in Big Tech, but the EU proposal is among the most ambitious and may be the closest to becoming reality. According to Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission, the DMA could take effect as early as October, although it could be longer before consumers start to see changes as regulators determine which tech companies are covered by the law and the companies figure out how to implement the new rules.\n\n“This is a very big deal, because this is the first strong, comprehensive set of regulations that’s specific to market power in internet platforms,” said Mitch Stoltz, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n\nEven tech advocacy groups opposed to the DMA also agree that the legislation will result in major changes. “Many of the requirements force the Big Tech platforms to change their services in pretty significant ways,” said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the Chamber of Progress, an industry organization backed by Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent, Meta. And as with other proposed regulation targeting the industry, some tech groups also warn of unintended consequences from the DMA for companies and consumers.\n\nWhile the legislation is clearly targeted at the dominance of US tech giants, it doesn’t single out specific companies. Instead, the DMA creates a special category of “gatekeeper” businesses that are subject to greater regulation. It will cover platform providers who meet several benchmarks, including having more than 45 million monthly EU users and EU revenues of at least 7.5 billion euros or a market cap of at least 75 billion euros.\n\nThe regulations will apply only in Europe, but many policy experts expect that the ideas set forth in the DMA could eventually be enshrined into law worldwide, both because it sets expectations for regulators elsewhere and because tech companies could choose to adopt the changes more widely.\n\n“We often see that it’s easier for companies to implement a change globally than to just do it in one jurisdiction,” said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge, a US-based consumer advocacy group. “There very well may be changes to US products that comply with the EU rule.\n\nHere are some of the ways the rules may affect users in Europe, and possibly beyond.\n\nUnder the DMA, mobile operating system makers may be required to allow consumers to download apps from third-party app stores. Adobe Stock\n\nApp stores\n\nSome of the most visible proposed changes for EU users deal with apps — how you can install them and what can be pre-installed on devices, among other things. These changes could have major implications for Apple and Google, two of the world’s biggest mobile operating systems and app store operators.\n\nOne major provision in the DMA requires dominant operating systems to allow smaller, third-party app stores, as well as sideloading — the ability to install apps from anywhere outside the official app store. Historically, Google has allowed for both on the Android platform, while Apple has maintained tight control over iPhone apps. Apple and other industry players have argued that opening up operating systems in this way could leave users vulnerable to downloading more harmful apps.\n\n“Consumers who have pined for a more open Apple [app] store will find something to like in this legislation,” said Joel Mitnick, a competition lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. “On the other hand, many consumers purchase Apple devices in part because of their reliance on Apple as a gatekeeper of app compatibility and quality. Those consumers may be disappointed by the law.”\n\nUnder the new rules, dominant app stores also can’t de-list apps for refusing to use the gatekeeper’s proprietary payment systems, an issue highlighted most recently by Apple’s antitrust case with Epic Games. Much of Apple’s app store revenue comes from the 30% cut it receives through its payment channels from in-app sales of digital goods and services, so the provisions could directly affect the company’s business model.\n\nDefault services\n\nOther aspects of the DMA could affect what software comes bundled with electronic devices. For example, gatekeeper platforms that simultaneously control a web browser and a mobile operating system won’t be allowed to set their browser as an automatic default, said Agustin Reyna, senior legal officer at BEUC, a European consumer advocacy group. Instead, users will be given more choices.\n\n“So, when consumers start their phone for the first time, they will see a popup window that will say, ‘Would you like to install a different browser or search engine?’” Reyna said.\n\nIt wouldn’t take many people acting on the prompt to make a big difference to competition, Reyna said, offering the example of DuckDuckGo, a smaller rival to Google.\n\n“Even 1% of Google search users switching to DuckDuckGo — for Google, maybe it’s not that much, but for DuckDuckGo, that’s massive,” he said. Still, the dominant players have fiercely defended their hold as default services; Google reportedly pays Apple billions of dollars a year to ensure it is the default search engine on Apple products.\n\nGoogle began offering a browser and search engine choice prompt to EU users back in 2019 — after European officials concluded the company had violated antitrust rules by making Google search and Chrome the defaults on Android — but the DMA takes that concept and applies it across the industry more broadly.\n\nSearch engines\n\nThe DMA could affect what users see when they enter searches into Google. Under the legislation’s provisions for self-preferencing, gatekeeper companies can’t rank their own products and services more favorably than those of competing providers, and they will be required to rank competitors’ offerings in a “fair and nondiscriminatory” way.\n\nPractically speaking, this could mean a boost for smaller online travel search platforms, local restaurant review sites and other businesses that receive traffic from Google when users search for plane tickets or places to eat nearby (Yelp has been a big proponent of such regulations).\n\nUnder the new rules, Google wouldn’t be able to give preferential placement to its own travel listings or restaurant reviews. For consumers, that could mean, for example, that they may no longer see Google Flights at the top of the search results page when they’re looking to take a trip. (Google previously implemented some changes to its search results in Europe in response to antitrust regulators, including featuring rival services’ results prominently alongside its own, but the DMA could force it to go even further.)\n\nBut while search results might be the most obvious place to apply the self-preferencing ban, the prohibition could potentially be interpreted more broadly, too, said Reyna.\n\n“This self-preferencing provision applies to all gatekeepers, so what if Apple is identified as a gatekeeper [in this context]? Apple would not be able to self-preference its own Apple Music service in detriment of Spotify or other competitors,” Reyna said.\n\nEuropean Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager has said the Digital Markets Act could take effect as early as October, although it could take longer for consumers to start to see the effects of the new rules. John Thys/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMessaging services\n\nThe new legislation could also change the way consumers message each other. A big focus of the DMA is on interoperability, or the ability for platforms from different providers to connect to each other. Portions of the DMA specifically zero in on interoperability among private messaging apps, such as Apple’s iMessage and Meta’s WhatsApp and Messenger services.\n\nThe DMA sets the stage for iMessage users to be able to send messages to WhatsApp users or vice versa, or for WhatsApp users to be able to message Telegram or Signal users, or any other combination of the above. A consumer using iMessage may also be able to video call or send files automatically to someone using WhatsApp or Messenger.\n\nThe legislation gives competing messaging platforms the right to ask to connect to one another’s users. Exactly how this would work, technically, would be the subject of future standards-setting. B ut establishing the requirement is the first step toward a more interoperable world where platforms can’t simply rely on their size and popularity to “lock in” their users and prevent them from switching, policy experts say.\n\nAt the same time, however, security experts say that what makes some messaging apps so powerful — their privacy features, and particularly support for end-to-end encryption — could be compromised under the mandate. Not only are there technical challenges to building a secure system that works across multiple platforms, but there may also be problems tied to identity management and the privacy risks that crop up alongside them.\n\n“Interoperability has long been viewed as a way to solve lock-in problems,” said Bruce Hoffman, a competition expert at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb. “The thing about interoperability requirements is that you have to be very careful with how you design them and what they actually do.”\n\nThere is some risk that in order to meet the interoperability requirements, messaging services could offer the most basic format of their platforms for European consumers, removing end-to-end encryption and other, more advanced features that users elsewhere in the world will still have access to, according to Nick Seeber, a partner leading Deloitte’s Internet Regulation team, which helps advise online companies on how to comply with regulations. The new rules could also create some challenges for smaller tech players.\n\n“The companies who are best at offering regulatory compliance are the largest tech platforms who have got the deepest pockets and resources to be able to implement these parts of the regulation,” Seeber said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/theranos-rise-and-fall/index.html", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than three years after Elizabeth Holmes was first indicted and nearly four months after her trial kicked off, the founder and former CEO of failed blood testing startup Theranos was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nHolmes, the founder and former CEO of Theranos, was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges in January after a months-long trial. Balwani, Theranos’ former president and COO who was also Holmes’ live-in boyfriend at the time, was found guilty on Thursday of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nThe verdict comes after a stunning downfall that saw Holmes, once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, go from being a tech industry icon to being a rare Silicon Valley entrepreneur on trial for fraud.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there.

It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO. Holmes remains chair of the company’s board.\n\nFormer Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny' Balwani leaves the Robert F. Peckham U.S. Federal Court on June 28, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Taylor said more than 80 potential buyers were not interested in a sale. “We are now out of time,” Taylor wrote.\n\nMarch 2019: Theranos gets the documentary treatment\n\nAlex Gibney, the prolific documentary filmmaker behind “Dirty Money,” “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” and “The Armstrong Lie,” debuts “The Inventor” on HBO, following the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nSeptember 2020: Holmes’ possible defense strategy comes to light\n\nA new court document reveals Holmes may seek a “mental disease” defense in her criminal fraud trial. Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial. Holmes’ counsel advised the US government that Holmes is due in July 2021, a court document revealed. She gave birth in July.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and former chief executive officer of Theranos Inc.

A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nHolmes’s sentencing date is set for late September to allow for the completion of Balwani’s trial. In the meantime, Holmes remains free on a $500,000 bond secured by property.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., left center, departs from federal court with, from left, husband Billy Evans, parents Noel Holmes and Christian Holmes IV in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022.

Amanda Seyfried stars as Holmes and Naveen Andrews plays Balwani. Their romantic and professional relationship features prominently in the show.\n\nFollowing delays due to Holmes’ prolonged trial then a surge of Covid-19, jury selection for Balwani’s trial gets underway. On March 22, opening arguments are held and the government’s first witness, a former Theranos employee turned whistleblower, is called to the stand.\n\nJuly 2022: Balwani guilty of federal fraud\n\nAfter four full days of deliberations, a jury finds Balwani guilty of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Like Holmes, Balwani faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/12/04/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-so-polarizing/3770929/", "title": "Why is Gwyneth Paltrow so polarizing?", "text": "Ann Oldenburg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPeople seem to either love or hate the 41-year-old actress\n\nCritics say she%27s out of touch with average people and elitist\n\nWhile fans praise her for her beauty%2C brains and ambition\n\nShe's beautiful. She's got an Oscar. She's married to a rock star. She's best friends with Beyoncé. And she was People magazine's pick for Most Beautiful Woman of 2013.\n\nYet she's mocked for what she eats. She's criticized for the pricey Christmas gift guide on her lifestyle website, Goop. She's dissed for driving her kids to school on a Vespa. And she topped Star magazine's Most Hated Celebrity list for 2013.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow may be the most polarizing celebrity to come down the stardom pike in a long, long time.\n\nHow exactly did this princess of beloved Hollywood royalty — she's the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and late producer Bruce Paltrow and her godfather is Steven Spielberg — cultivate such a love-hate relationship with the world?\n\n\"Inevitably, in a saga of Hollywood, people identify with either the sympathetic character or the villain,\" says Dylan Howard, editor in chief of celebrity news site RadarOnline. \"When it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, she's both the villain and sympathetic figure.\"\n\nLOVE HER? HATE HER? OR LOVE TO HATE HER?\n\nA 2010 Voguearticle written by a journalist who visited Paltrow, 41, in her London home described the star as having an \"impossibly perfect life.\"\n\nAnd it seems she does.\n\nPaltrow not only has it all (as mentioned above). She does it all. She acts. (She snagged her Oscar early in her career, in 1999 for Shakespeare in Love, and in 2011 won an Emmy for her Glee guest-star stint.) She sings. (Remember her Cee Lo Green duet at the 2011 Grammys?) She's a lifestyle guru. (On Thursday, she is unveiling a special holiday collaboration with designer Michael Kors, available only through Goop.) She's an author (of at least three cookbooks). She's a mom (Apple, 9, and Moses, 7). She's a wife (Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin). She's a style icon (with seven Vogue covers to her credit) with a fab figure (Tracy Anderson is her personal trainer).\n\nDo you hate her yet?\n\nBut it isn't just having it all or doing it all that has fostered both the iconic worship and the intense scorn.\n\nThis has been building for years — or at least the past five, going back to when she launched Goop and began branching out from acting. And she began putting herself out there, Martha Stewart-style.\n\nIt's the very thing fans love about her. She'll share with you the best place in Paris to get a bikini wax. She'll say she'd \"rather die\" than let her kids eat \"Cup-a-Soup.\" She'll acknowledge she \"should have worn a bra\" with her 2002 Oscar gown. And she'll even admit that the glittery A-list-filled Met Ball was \"un-fun\" because it was crowded and hot. She'll share that she had a miscarriage and battled some postpartum depression. And she'll drop f-bombs all along the way. (If she has a potty mouth, how snooty can she be?)\n\nLove her yet?\n\nBut while Jennifer Lawrence, for example, is earning praise for her candor, Paltrow's remarks often don't seem to sit right.\n\n\"She's on this incredible high horse,\" says James Heidenry, editor in chief of Star, the publication that put her at No. 1 on the Most Hated Celeb list for 2013 (along with Chris Brown, Lindsay Lohan, Anne Hathaway and others). \"She comes off like an insufferable elitist. And she seems so unaware.\"\n\nHollywood Reporter staff editor Michael O'Connell says, \"It's that detachment, perceived detachment that comes with wealth and fame.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Daily Beast writer Kevin Fallon wrote \"Why Do We Still Hate Gwyneth Paltrow?\" in which he noted, \"There's a veritable encyclopedia of quotes those who are annoyed by her can cite to prove what they perceive as her unconscionable lack of self-awareness and apparently unstomachable pretentiousness.\"\n\nSome evidence:\n\nIn 2006 she told The Guardian : \"I love the English way, which is not as capitalistic as it is in America. People don't talk about work and money; they talk about interesting things at dinner parties.\"\n\nIn 2009, she told the March issue of Elle UK : \"I am who I am. I can't pretend to be somebody who makes $25,000 a year.\"\n\nIn 2010, she told the Press Association: \"Every woman can make time (to work out) — every woman — and you can do it with your baby in the room. There have been countless times where I've worked out with my kids crawling around all over the place. You just make it work.\"\n\nIn 2011, GQ put her on its Least Influential list, noting it was the year she \"unleashed her awful cookbook on the world, a book that included such amazingly vapid sentences as 'We've got a wood-burning pizza oven in the garden — a luxury, I know, but it's one of the best investments I've ever made.'\"\n\nIn 2011, Buzzfeed came up with a list of 7 Reasons Why People Hate Gwyneth Paltrow. Alternate title: 7 incredibly pretentious Gwyneth Paltrow quotes\n\nAnd this month, she unveiled her Goop Christmas gift guide with toys including a $100 slingshot for a boy and $531 pajamas for mom. It has been called \"silly\" (New York's Daily News), \"outrageous\" (Yahoo.com) and \"ridiculous\" (Radar).\n\n\"She doesn't have that common touch,\" explains brand expert David Johnson, CEO of Strategic Vision in Atlanta. He adds, \"She doesn't seem to know how to relate to people and that turns a lot of people off. They admire her, but at the same time, there's this sense that she's out of touch with average people.\"\n\nPaltrow has admitted she's aware of her image problem. \"I'm a real lighting rod,\" she acknowledged in an interview with USA TODAY in May. But she doesn't think it's her fault.\n\n\"People project a lot of stuff onto me. It's nothing to do with me. I don't read stuff about myself. I feel like it's none of my business. People perceive that I have too much. I understand that, but I also feel like I've suffered so much. It's not something I talk about. I don't have a perfect life. I don't have a perfect anything. I have incredible struggles, and I'm far from perfect. I struggle like every other woman, every other mother. I understand that things look a certain way.\"\n\nNow, she says, she has gotten to the point where she basically doesn't care what people think.\n\nIn one of her most recent interviews, with U.K.'s Red magazine, she said, \"The older I get I realize it doesn't matter what people who don't know you think. It doesn't matter. You're wasting your energy.\" Her advice is to \"do what is right for you and don't give a (expletive) what anyone else thinks.\"\n\nSo there.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\n\"For a celeb brand to be boring\" is the kiss of death, says brand expert Allen Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates in New York. \"You're better off being provocative and edgy.\"\n\nPaltrow is doing exactly what she should to be successful, he says. \"Brands need to have a point of view. Her point of view can be polarizing, but on balance, you're better having half the room loving you than having the whole room thinking you're just OK.\"\n\nIt's true of any big business, he says. \"Look at Apple. There are people who hate Apple, and of course there are Apple fans who are nuts about it.\"\n\nPaltrow is \"far more ambitious than the average Hollywood celebrity.\" He adds, \"The best brands create friction and passion in the marketplace. I think she's doing very well.\"\n\n\"It's interesting the amount of chatter Gwyneth Paltrow is generating,\" says Ammiel Kamon, executive vice president of Kontera's products and marketing division. The data analyst group measures \"consumption\" — or how often a brand is seen — of celebrities. In the lifestyle category, which relates to Paltrow's Goop, she has carved out 14% of the audience, right behind Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSo whatever anyone's saying, Kamon notes, \"may be in a bad context for her, but it does have a net positive effect.\"\n\nPaltrow's Q score, the likability measure for famous folks, is 16, which means 16% of adults who are familiar with her say she's one of their favorite personalities.\n\nA 16 \"is about average,\" explains Henry Schafer, executive vice president of The Q Score company. A very high Q score would be somewhere around \"42, 43,\" he says. Two celebs who generally pull that kind of score: Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock.\n\nAs of September, the latest Q score report, awareness of Paltrow was at 74%, says Schafer, which means three out of four adults know who she is. The average awareness for a celeb is 31%, so \"she's pretty well-known for sure.\"\n\nAnd she has plenty of fans.\n\n\"We love her,\" says Zanna Roberts Rassi, Marie Claire senior fashion editor and E! fashion correspondent. \"She's such an icon and so fashionable. The fact that she's a smart woman and an entrepreneur makes her more than just a beauty. She's definitely got brains.\"\n\nAdds Rassi, \"She is well-respected in the industry. I could call any publicist and ask to borrow (designer clothes) for Gwyneth and they would absolutely send. That isn't true of every celebrity. She's very polished. She's a classic.\"\n\nSo what should Paltrow do to move the needle more with the masses? Is anything really at stake for her? Any reason to try to be more Sandy Bullock-y?\n\n\"If I were advising her, one thing I'd suggest is to get into the forefront as a spokesperson for different causes,\" says brand expert Johnson. \"I would advise her to get involved in something so people could see a softer side of her — animals, children or battered women. Things that people can relate to. We know a lot of young girls think she's great. They look to her beauty and her grace.\"\n\nPaltrow did step out this past week for a Kids Company Dinner, a charity event she co-hosted with designer Matthew Williamson. But the only press she got was on sites that noticed how her bejeweled dress seem to blend into the ornaments on the Christmas tree she posed in front of.\n\nAnd on Dec. 16, she launches a new AOL Web series called The Restart Project with her pal Tracy Anderson in which they spend time with and showcase inspiring stories of women who have overcome hardships.\n\nBUT WHAT'S IT ALL WORTH?\n\nSo, basically, there's nothing at stake for her. No reason to suddenly put $5 items in her Goop gift guide. No reason to censor herself. Nothing to apologize for.\n\nOne thing that could do some damage, though, is the rumored \"epic takedown\" (that's what Us Weekly called it) Vanity Fair is prepping. It's been buzzing since a New York Times article reported that Paltrow sent an e-mail telling her pals to \"please decline\" any interview requests and not cooperate, even though it's unclear what the article says that could be so damaging.\n\nTo survive that, Johnson says, \"if there's anything in it, the key for any celebrity is the reservoir of goodwill they've developed among fellow professionals and fans.\"\n\nNo matter what that article says, or this one for that matter, Johnson advises that \"one of the worst things she could do is try to pretend to be something she's not.\"\n\n\"Honestly,\" says THR's O'Connell, \"she seems to have a pretty great quality of life. She's obviously doing things that she loves. She has a criminally adorable family. I would love to be Gwyneth Paltrow. Seems pretty awesome!\"\n\nHe adds, \"With any of that snark, there's a certain amount of envy in that. If you're posting 20 pictures on Buzzfeed with snarky quotes, part of you really wants to be Gwyneth Paltrow.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2022/03/04/ford-model-e-blue-gas-electric-cuts-jobs/9356510002/", "title": "Ford's plan to cut $3B in waste will funnel money from gas vehicles ...", "text": "Ford Motor Co. sent its employees an email early Wednesday, inviting them to attend what many expected to be a routine town hall a few hours later at 10 a.m.\n\nThere was no mention of the agenda or preview of a major announcement.\n\nBut it would prove to be what analysts and industry watchers consider one of the most pivotal days in the history of the 118-year-old automaker.

The company’s testing centers located inside Walgreens stores all have closed. And the company, once reportedly valued at $9 billion, has laid off nearly all employees.\n\nWhile federal prosecutors have charged Holmes and former Theranos President Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani with wire fraud, former patients are pursuing cases on their own in federal and state courts. Nine ex-Theranos customers are plaintiffs in a federal class-action lawsuit against Theranos and Walgreens in U.S. District Court in Phoenix.\n\nOne woman, identified as D.L., claimed that Theranos' inaccurate results indicated she tested positive for an autoimmune disease, Sjögren's syndrome, that prompted her to consult with a doctor and be checked for food allergies. After she was tested by another lab company, her doctor determined that she did not have the autoimmune condition.\n\nThe lawsuit states another woman identified as L.M. was diagnosed with a thyroid condition called Hashimoto's disease based on inaccurate Theranos test results. Her doctor ordered testing from another lab company that showed she did not have that condition.\n\nThe initial diagnosis based on inaccurate lab tests was \"devastating to her\" because it prompted her to change her lifestyle, make unnecessary medical appointments and take medication she did not need, the lawsuit states.\n\nBoth Theranos and Walgreens have denied wrongdoing and filed separate motions to dismiss the federal class-action lawsuit. In April, a federal judge agreed to toss out 7 categories of claims but allowed 13 to move ahead for the plaintiffs in the case, now in discovery. One plaintiff, R.C., who alleged that he had a heart attack one month after getting an inaccurate blood test, voluntarily dropped his claims.\n\nPolitical leaders in metro Phoenix welcomed Theranos with open arms five years ago and the area served as testing grounds for its unproven finger-stick blood draws.\n\nAt its peak, Theranos operated 40 centers inside Walgreens stores in metro Phoenix and sold more than 1.5 million blood tests that yielded 7.8 million test results for nearly 176,000 consumers.\n\nBut court documents state slightly more than 1 in 10 test results were voided or corrected, and some patients claim in lawsuits that they were harmed by inaccurate test results.\n\nOthers chose not to sue but worry that there's little to safeguard consumers from another medical technology company making similar mistakes.\n\nPeoria, Arizona resident Steve Hammons visited a Theranos clinic five times in September and October 2015 to monitor the results of a blood-thinning drug. Based on the results of those tests, a doctor ordered him to discontinue warfarin and switch to another drug.\n\nOne test included inaccurate results that were later revised, Hammons said. Theranos did not return a USA TODAY query about Hammons' test results.\n\nHe had heart surgery and a followup procedure to drain blood from the pericardial sac, which contains the heart. He does not know whether more accurate test results would have prompted his doctors to change his course of care and potentially avert the second operation to drain blood.\n\nHowever, he said it made him realize how little protection consumers get from federal and state government regulators overseeing the lab business.\n\n“That makes me very concerned and worried for the safety of other Arizonans,” said Hammons, who once worked in the medical services division of a private health insurance company. “Government had a role in patient safety. The powers that be dropped the ball.”\n\n'An American success story'\n\nTheranos operated only one center not far from its Palo Alto, California headquarters when it chose Arizona for its ambitious expansion in the fall of 2013. At the time, company officials cited Arizona's high uninsured rate and business-friendly environment.\n\nArizona also had a state law that allowed labs to sell a limited number of tests directly to consumers without a doctor's orders.\n\nTheranos pumped up its marketing with media interviews, billboards and television commercials touting a proprietary technology that the company claimed would revolutionize the lab industry by delivering accurate results from a finger-stick sample of just a few drops of blood. But the company also appealed to Arizona's political leaders to relax rules and allow broader, direct-to-consumer testing.\n\nTheranos contributed language to House Bill 2645, which allowed labs to sell any test to a consumer without a doctor's order. The bill sailed through the Arizona Legislature despite concerns raised by doctors' groups such as the Arizona Medical Association and Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey and legislative leaders from both parties hailed Theranos in an April 2015 bill-signing ceremony at Theranos' lab in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nDucey lauded Holmes as \"the definition of an American success story\" and said the bill \"keeps our regulations light\" and reflects Arizona's values as a business-friendly state.\n\nThree years later, the governor's spokeswoman said in a statement that businesses that tout new technology must prove themselves in the marketplace. \"Bad actors must be held accountable, and in this case, that's happening,\" said the statement. \"Public health and safety is always a top concern and we will continue to do all that we can to protect the well-being of Arizonans while also allowing individuals to have greater access to their medical information.\n\nThe region's dominant lab-testing company, Sonora Quest, also objected to the legislation. But after realizing the strong political momentum behind the bill, Sonora Quest did not formerly oppose the bill and later formed a unit that sells lab tests directly to consumers.\n\nQuestions of accuracy\n\nTheranos' fortune began to turn later in 2015 when the Wall Street Journal published the first in a series of stories that raised questions about the accuracy of the company's micro-blood draws and its underlying Edison technology.\n\nReports revealed that the company often relied on more traditional vein blood draws and lab equipment made by other companies rather than its unproven medical technology.\n\nFederal lab regulators with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stepped up oversight of Theranos and moved to revoke that company's laboratory certificate after finding the company's operation in Newark, Calif., posed an \"immediate jeopardy\" to consumers.\n\nTheranos reached a settlement with the federal agency, agreeing to a two-year ban from the blood-testing business and a $30,000 civil penalty.\n\nIn April 2017, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich negotiated a consumer-fraud settlement to refund up to $4.65 million to consumers who purchased Theranos blood tests. The checks were disbursed through a third-party administrator with more than 80 percent of the settlement as of June 2018, officials said.\n\nWhile the settlement provided consumers financial relief, it did little to address customers who were harmed by inaccurate test results, according to attorneys representing patients.\n\n\"The attorney general was able to get the money,\" said Leonard Aragon, a Phoenix attorney who represents a patient in a lawsuit against Walgreens in Maricopa County Superior Court. \"That doesn't compensate people for being damaged by bogus test results.\"\n\nLawmakers now acknowledge that some patients may have been harmed by inaccurate test results. However, they insist that consumers have benefited from greater access to testing sold by other labs.\n\n\"The good news is there are other very high quality laboratory companies in Arizona that have embraced the legislation and have had tremendous success,\" said Heather Carter, an Arizona House Representative who sponsored the direct-access bill.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about patient safety,\" Carter said. \"Hopefully justice will be served and people will have their day in court on this.\"\n\nMore:Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and former president Balwani charged with federal fraud\n\nReport: Embattled blood-testing company Theranos lays off most remaining workers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

A generation later, Mom retired as a prison warden after 25 years.\n\nBack then, retirement meant collecting full pensions and full benefits. Their wish was to do little else than rest and recover from decades of body- and soul-crushing work that had zapped their mental and physical strength.\n\nRoxanne Jones CNN\n\nGrandpop, a war veteran, packed his bags and migrated back down South when he retired. And there he sat on his porch, enjoying my grandmom’s peach cobbler and listening to crickets until the day God called him home – just a decade later.\n\nCancer awaited Mom the day she retired. And she spent a decade battling before she, thankfully, won her body back and took flight. Today, she’s an adventure-seeking globetrotter.\n\nThat was retirement life for generations past. Sacrifice all for one job, not out of passion but out of a necessity to provide. Then, retire and pray for enough sunsets left to find joy.\n\nSerena Williams was right to reject the word “retirement” in her recent essay in Vogue that revealed she would be moving on, or “evolving,” from tennis after competition in the US Open.\n\nShe called it her evolution and she was right.\n\nIn this America, retirement – from pro sports or any other job – is not what it used to be.\n\nSerena Williams is congratulated by Venus Williams after winning the Women's Singles Final match at the Australian Open on January 28, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. Scott Barbour/Getty Images\n\nWilliams’ words resonated deeply for many, including myself, a woman and mother who walked away from a highly successful (though hardly Serena-level) corporate career in my early 40s.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” Williams wrote. “A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.”\n\nNever one to stick to just tennis, throughout her career Serena (and her sister Venus) were encouraged by their parents to explore their passions outside the game. That lesson has put Serena in a powerful position now as she begins to re-center her life.\n\nSerena Ventures, which the tennis champion launched in 2013, is her one of her passions now. According to Williams, the six-person firm (five women and one recently-hired man) has invested in 16 ventures (including MasterClass, Tonal and Impossible Foods to name a few) that are today valued at more then $1 billion.\n\n“Seventy-eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are.”\n\nIf Williams did all that while chasing tennis trophies, imagine what she will accomplish now.\n\nIt would be a mistake to scoff at her rejection of the word retirement. Though immediately after her announcement Monday, many women, and men, debated whether Serena – hands down one of the greatest athletes in the world – was conveniently playing semantics. Some said she was just another woman bowing out to have a baby.\n\nThe eye-rolling around Serena’s word choice is no surprise.\n\nOur culture struggles to validate powerful, iconic women like Williams, let alone other women who have excelled in their chosen fields. And society continues to view our ability to bear children as a weakness instead of the amazing superpower, that I’ve always believed it to be.\n\nSerena Williams posted this photo to Instagram of her and her daughter playing tennis, with the message, 'Caption this.' Serena Williams/Instagram\n\nBy using the word “evolve,” Serena has done what society has failed to do when it comes to framing talented women who excel early in a chosen career, then leave on their own terms and lean instead into themselves. Embracing our full humanity, many women shift their focus to other goals they can transcend in life, be it motherhood, launching a business or exploring other life passions.\n\nWatching women realize their limitless capacity for greatness is a beautiful thing. Williams’ life has been an inspiration for millions of women with less power and prestige. And her latest evolution is no different.\n\nMany women of all economic backgrounds, including those in my own peer group, are reimagining and expanding, what success looks like in our lives.\n\nIt isn’t an easy choice to make. Williams, who calls herself a “savage” competitor, knows her evolution will be painful. Despite breaking numerous records, winning four Olympic gold medals and 23 Grand Slam championships – surpassing tennis greats like Billie Jean King, Martina Hingis, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova – Williams is not yet rejoicing at this new turn in her life.\n\nNo, this phenomenal woman still only sees areas where she could have been greater: the wins she didn’t get to surpass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles. (It should be noted that Court won before the modern-day “open era” that began back in 1968.)\n\n“The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary,” Williams said in her essay, adding that she had no regrets about having a family over building her tennis resume.\n\nIt is this unabashed pursuit of excellence and warrior spirit – on the court and off – that have endeared Williams to so many.\n\nHer childbirth story is a familiar one among the Black women I know, who often cite inadequate medical care by health care professionals who ignored early warning signs during pregnancy.\n\nThe US maternal morbidity rates are among the worst the world among wealthy nations, especially for Black, Native American and rural women. So much so that recently, President Joe Biden launched a federal initiative to examine how racism, housing policy, policing, climate change and pollution affect maternal mortality rates.\n\nWilliams opined that were she a man, she would have had a longer career, free to pursue more championships. She could have been a Tom Brady, she said. It is a painful reckoning when women admit their professional goals will be cut short solely because of their gender.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

Mid-career after a rapid rise, countless awards and recording a lot of “firsts,” I had to face that my goal was far-fetched. In fact, no woman at the company – no matter her leadership skills, motherhood status or experience – was going to become president at the sports media giant. Not back then, not today.\n\nI remain hopeful for that day, but leaving is a move I’ve never regretted.\n\nWilliams and women who dare to step out into the world on their own terms are my superheroes.\n\nShe has grown the game of tennis immeasurably. She has redefined the women’s power game, attracted record-breaking TV audiences and revenue growth, won equal pay (along with her sister Venus), a battle that began with King. Williams has ushered in a new generation of fierce power hitters – and made it safer for them to show up as their authentic selves.\n\nSerena Williams came, she saw and she conquered.\n\nAnd I cannot wait to see what she does next.", "authors": ["Roxanne Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/21/companies-make-pledges-un-climate-summit/15891791/", "title": "Companies to make climate pledges at U.N. summit", "text": "Wendy Koch\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK — Touted as the world's largest gathering ever on climate change, this week's U.N. Climate Summit will be as much about business as politics.\n\nMajor companies, including Big Oil, will make pledges to help fight global warming by cutting their heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, protecting the world's forests and reducing methane leakage from fossil fuel production.\n\nThey're getting nudged to act, not just by tens of thousands of climate marchers who clogged Manhattan streets Sunday — some dressed as polar bears and others carrying signs that read, \"Go Solar,\" \"Fracking=Death\" and \"There Is No Planet B\" — but by investors demanding action.\n\nThe result will be a climate extravaganza unlike any before. \"This is very different. It's not just policy leaders,\" says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a non-profit group that promotes sustainability. There's an \"unprecedented\" number of companies, investors and finance ministers involved, she says.\n\n\"It's a very, very positive sign,\" Todd Stern, U.S. special envoy for climate change, said in a White House briefing last week. \"Business is increasingly focused on trying to, in some cases, be part of the clean energy revolution.\"\n\nMonday, one day before the summit, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is slated to announce new fossil fuel divestment. Hundreds of wealthy individuals and at least 50 foundations will pledge to divest any holdings in the world's top 200 oil and gas producers, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron.\n\n\"It's a snowballing movement,\" says Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which is signing on. His fund is controlled by a family whose fortune was made in the oil industry.\n\nThat's not all.\n\n•About two dozen large companies will join environmental groups and 24 countries to stop deforestation, which can exacerbate global warming by releasing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They'll commit not to source products — including palm oil, soy and beef — from land where forests have been recently or illegally cut down. They'll join Nestle, Kellogg's, Hershey's and General Mills, which have already pledged action.\n\n\"It's a good news story I never would have predicted,\" says Charles McNeill, a senior policy adviser for the United Nations Development Program, adding that it brings together groups that don't usually partner. He says major companies are taking the lead, but smaller ones will follow.\n\n•Six of the world's largest oil and gas companies will commit, via a new partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to take steps to reduce methane leaks in fossil fuel production.\n\n\"This is an enormous opportunity\" for the industry, says Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group. He says emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, account for 25% of global warming.\n\n•World Bank President Jim Yong Kim will unveil a growing list of companies and cities that, like his organization, support a price on carbon. Advocates say that taxing fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit carbon when burned, will increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable power.\n\nLast week, more than 340 global institutional investors with at least $24 trillion in assets — including Swiss Re and the Unitarian Universalist Association — called on government leaders to adopt carbon pricing. The European Union has done so, but the United States has not.\n\n•We Mean Business, a coalition working with thousands of companies and investors, will launch with a report on increasing business support for low-carbon energy. It holds a discussion Monday between top U.N. climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the leaders of two companies that have pledged to get all their power from renewable sources: Apple's Tim Cook and Ikea's Peter Agnefjäll.\n\nDozens of climate-related events will take place this week in the Big Apple, but the summit itself occurs Tuesday at U.N. headquarters. President Obama and leaders from more than 120 countries are likely to announce climate initiatives, and company CEOs will participate in talks or make their own commitments.\n\n\"We're taking this summit seriously, both to show that the United States is committed to leading the fight against climate change and to call on other leaders to step up to the plate,\" says John Podesta, Obama's counselor.\n\nHe says Obama will outline U.S. efforts but will not make a new emissions-cutting pledge until early next year. In 2009, at U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen, Obama pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by 17%, from 2005 levels, by 2020 — a goal the country is largely on course to meet.\n\nThe leaders of China and India, the world's first- and third-largest emitters of carbon dioxide, will not attend. Podesta said, however, China will be represented at \"a very high level\" by its vice premier, and India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, will be meeting with Obama a few days later in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe summit will get a dose of Hollywood. Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, chosen as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, will speak. \"I feel a moral obligation to speak out at this key moment in human history,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThough the event is not part of formal U.N. climate negotiations, it's aimed at creating momentum for a new global accord to be signed next year in Paris. Prior U.N. agreements have not reduced global carbon emissions, which continue to rise mostly because of economic development in Asia.\n\nThis time may be different, says Jennifer Morgan, who directs climate and energy programs at the World Resources Institute, a research group. She says there's a greater sense of urgency about climate change as its impacts — sea level rise, drought, wildfires — become more visible.\n\nShe says the cost of solutions, such as wind and solar power, has fallen as their use has expanded. She says more companies see global warming as a business risk and embrace sustainability, which is \"not the bogeyman anymore.\"\n\nStern, the U.S. climate negotiator, says there may be more \"realism as well as ambition\" among countries to address climate change than occurred at the Copenhagen talks in 2009. Still, he says, \"these negotiations are always difficult.\"\n\nFigueres, the U.N. negotiator, says net carbon emissions will need to be slashed to zero in the second half of this century to keep a global temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHeintz says his fund, the legacy of John D. Rockefeller, may signal a shift in U.S. attitudes. It devotes half its grants to promoting renewable power and climate research.\n\nHe says Rockefeller believed in innovation and in founding Standard Oil, he put an older industry — whale oil — out of business. \"I'm convinced that if he were alive today,\" Heintz says, \"he'd be looking out to the future and investing in clean energy technology.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/donald-trump-defense-january-6/index.html", "title": "Analysis: How the defense of Trump foretells a possible new GOP ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a strong political case for Republicans to ignore Donald Trump halfway through a midterm primary season that’s seen his influence over voters wane. But as the January 6 hearings hit prime time, the ex-President’s thunderous demands for loyalty and the hunger for power of his acolytes in the House mean that’s not an option.\n\nTrump’s demand for, and the GOP’s willingness to offer, a robust defense into what are expected to be damaging details of his complicity in a coup attempt are deeply revealing about his future political intentions and the former President’s control over his party. The evolving plan to hit back against the committee on behalf of Trump also exposes the hypocrisy and the ambition of key House Republican leaders who whitewash Trump’s role in the history of the January 6, 2021, insurrection to advance their own careers.\n\nIt offers a foreboding reality check 17 months after the Capitol insurrection about how the House Republican conference has chosen the promise of future political advancement over the protection of American democracy.\n\nThe plan for pro-Trump lawmakers to blitz the media in order to push back at the House select committee’s findings comes ahead of the panel’s first live televised prime-time hearing on Thursday and was revealed in a new CNN report on Sunday.\n\nThe committee is expected to mount a devastating case about Trump’s behavior as he tried to steal the 2020 election in the run-up to and during the January 6 assault on the Capitol, which he incited and didn’t act to stop as lawmakers ran for their lives.\n\nThere are potential pitfalls for Republicans who stand with Trump as the lurid tale of violence, lies and autocratic power grabs is told again for the American people and for the benefit of history. The evidence could be so damning that those who seek to discredit the hearings will find themselves defending the indefensible – a dark moment of the American story that is so heinous it will live in infamy.\n\nThere are also sound electoral reasons to pass. It’s not a given that the hearings will achieve their apparent purpose and engage Americans so far after the event. After all, after four years of tumult that ended in a political cataclysm, it’s hard to imagine there are many voters who haven’t made up their minds on Trump.\n\nEngaging and turning the hearings into a partisan spectacle could only elevate them. And Republicans have a much clearer route to power five months before the midterm elections than yet again appeasing Trump’s autocracy. They can simply blame President Joe Biden for the ills afflicting the country, given the disastrous political environment for Democrats as gasoline prices hit record highs and the cost of living soars.\n\nAnything that deflects from that goal seems unwise.\n\nThere’s also a risk that standing with Trump will brand the GOP all over again with the stain of defending a strongman who tried to overthrow a democratic election. That vision repeatedly punished the party when Trump was in power. And defending him could remind critical suburban voters all over again of just how extreme their party has become.\n\nTrump demands a strong defense\n\nStelter: Pro-Trump media is already rejecting Jan. 6 hearing 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nBut the determination of Trump to paint an alternative version of events for Americans through conservative media suggests that the ex-President really doesn’t want the true story of his behavior coming out.\n\nThe committee, through hundreds of interviews – some with people deep inside the Trump West Wing, despite obstruction from some of the ex-President’s former top aides – appears to have built a behind-the-scenes story of Trump’s conduct. Former aides to ex-Vice President Mike Pence are expected to be especially prominent in the televised hearings.\n\nIf the committee succeeds in convincing Americans of his culpability, it could seriously damage the ex-President’s hopes in a broader general election audience if he does seek to run again for the White House in 2024. There’s also the possibility that the panel has uncovered information that could put the twice-impeached President in legal jeopardy, though any criminal referral from the committee would require the Justice Department to initiate a prosecution – a potential long shot.\n\nHowever worried Trump may be about the hearings, the willingness of top House Republicans to defend his assault on democracy does show his hold over the party.\n\nCNN’s Melanie Zanona, Zachary Cohen and Ryan Nobles reported that Trump’s team had communicated with his allies on Capitol Hill that the former President wants a vigorous defense while public hearings play out on television. This impulse clearly fits with Trump’s lifelong desire to be in the spotlight and to shape the television narrative of his own life.\n\nIt’s also remarkable that a former President, bumped out of office in disgrace after a single term, still has the political juice to wield that kind of influence. This speaks to his appeal in the GOP grassroots and underscores his front-runner status for any 2024 Republican presidential primary race, even if some of his chosen candidates struggle in 2022 midterm primaries.\n\nAnd it offers a preview of how a new GOP House majority next year could largely be a tool for an increasingly extreme Trump’s efforts to hobble Biden and regain power.\n\nTrump’s power over McCarthy\n\nThe CNN report revealed that the defense will be led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who spoke out strongly against Trump publicly in the days after the insurrection and in an outspoken fashion behind the scenes, according to transcripts of calls featured in a new book by New York Times writers Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin.\n\nWhen it became clear, however, that the insurrection would not destroy Trump’s popularity in the minds of GOP voters, McCarthy soon changed course. His willingness to stand as Trump’s chief defender now shows how much leverage the ex-President has over him following the furor over the taped calls – and how his ambition to be speaker, and his tenure if he eventually wins the position, depends to a large extent in keeping the ex-President’s favor.\n\nHear how McCarthy's words on 1/6 have changed in a year 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother Trump acolyte who is vowing to destroy the credibility of the January 6 committee is Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, a former moderate whose embrace of the big election lie put her on a fast track to power in the House GOP.\n\n“We will be setting the record straight. We will be telling the truth to the American people, sharing the facts and also really pointing out how unprecedented and unconstitutional and illegitimate this committee is,” Stefanik told the right-wing website Breitbart in an interview.\n\nHer performance will reveal the incentives for power in the GOP and the compromises needed to retain Trump’s good graces. Her role will also put her on the opposite side of the argument of the Wyoming lawmaker she replaced as the number three leader in the House, Liz Cheney.\n\nThe daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney broke with Trump over the insurrection and serves as one of two Republicans on the House select committee. She lost her party leadership post and is now facing a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate over her determination to tell the truth about the threat to American democracy posed then and now by the ex-President.\n\nAnother key figure in Trump’s defense is likely to be Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who like McCarthy has defied a subpoena to testify before the House select committee.\n\nThe hard-charging Trump supporter will be closely watched by the White House since he will be a top candidate to head the House Judiciary Committee if Republicans win control of the House – and is likely to subject the Biden administration to a withering program of investigations in the run-up to the 2024 election.\n\nThis will all be designed to damage Biden and to boost Trump – who will be the true power behind the gavel in any House GOP majority and is already using that leverage to his advantage.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}]}

People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/asia/wang-jixian-chinese-vlogger-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "A Chinese vlogger shared videos of war-torn Ukraine. He's been ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWang Jixian didn’t set out to become the Chinese voice of resistance in Ukraine. The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia’s invasion of the country, simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.\n\n“I’m coming back from buying groceries,” he said in a video posted to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open.\n\nBut his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.\n\n“I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I’ll tell them what the real battlefield is,” he told CNN.\n\nHis daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine – a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has promoted Russian disinformation such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using “Nazi” tactics.\n\nWang Jixian holding his Chinese passport in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Courtesy Wang Jixian\n\nIn one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, “These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers – these are the people.”\n\nBut in doing so, he had waded into the middle of a messy controversy, with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia’s invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China’s highly restricted and censored social media – something Wang is hoping to change.\n\nBacklash of critics\n\nWang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting – so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city’s “artistic atmosphere” immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.\n\nHis videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life – quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.\n\n“Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again,” he said in one video. “People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa.”\n\nOther times, he’s more impassioned. “Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun,” he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. “Where is the sense in that?”\n\nAs these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.\n\n“You don’t need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from,” one popular comment on Douyin read. “The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people.”\n\nChina has tried to stake out a neutral position, choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying “all countries’ legitimate security concerns” should be addressed.\n\nIn a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.\n\n“I don’t understand how I ‘betrayed’ the country,” Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn’t understand China’s or Russia’s position – all he knew was that “every day the city is under fire, many were killed.”\n\nThe comments of anonymous online strangers don’t bother him – but they do when it’s from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia.\n\nHe said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: “Who sent you?” When Wang insisted he wasn’t doing it for money, the staffer replied: “Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let’s block each other.”\n\nThat “really hurt my heart,” Wang said.\n\nDetermined to stay\n\nChinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin.\n\nHe doesn’t know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in one video on March 7, he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.\n\nAfter speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.\n\nHe has received “countless” messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.\n\n“I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes,” he said. “I see people being calm, I see people brave … I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed.”\n\nThere are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.\n\nBut for now, Wang has no intention of leaving – not until “Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay,” he said. Apart from his affection for the city, it was a matter of principle, he added: “I can’t stand the act of bullying people in front of my face.”\n\nWhen he isn’t filming videos, Wang provides volunteer support in repairing people’s cell phones and assisting the displaced.\n\n“(If) I turned back and left, it would be enough to make me regret for the rest of my life,” he said. “I have no interest or desire to leave Ukraine until the war is ended and Ukraine has won.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Yong Xiong", "Jessie Yeung", "Yong Xiong"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/17/tidal-basin-flooding-rally-raccoon-garden-razed-news-around-states/50241761/", "title": "Tidal Basin flooding, 'rally raccoon': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A man convicted of murder more than a decade ago was captured Monday a day after escaping from a minimum-security corrections center near Mobile, prison officials said. Jeffery Strugg, 31, was discovered missing from community-based facility in Prichard on Sunday, according to a notice from the Alabama Department of Corrections. The agency didn’t release any information about how Strugg got out. He surrendered without any violence in Mobile County, corrections officials said. Strugg was 18 when he was sentenced to 29 years in prison after being convicted in the 2007 killing of Dewone Smiley, 15, in Selma, court records show. Strugg was accused of entering an apartment and shooting Smiley, a student at Selma High School, to death in front of two witnesses. Strugg is eligible for parole consideration Dec. 1, prison records show.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House on Saturday voted against accepting a spending package passed by the Senate that included payments of about $5,500 to residents. The vote to concur with the Senate package failed, with 18 members in favor of accepting the Senate plan and 22 against. The vote sets the stage for a conference committee, with the regular legislative session set to end by Wednesday. In a conference committee, House and Senate negotiators are tasked with hashing out differences between the state budgets that passed each chamber. The House, in its version of the budget, included a dividend of about $1,250 plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. The Senate plan called for a dividend of about $4,200 from Alaska’s oil wealth fund, an amount in line with a long-standing formula last used in 2015. The Senate plan also included a $1,300 energy check. Some lawmakers have argued the state is benefitting from high oil prices and can afford to help Alaskans who are struggling. But critics of the higher payments to residents say oil prices are volatile, and the oil price in the state revenue forecast can’t be assured.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal appeals court has upheld a judge’s ruling overturning a federal agency’s approval of Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals Inc.’s plan for a new open-pit copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of a permit for the Rosemont Mine project in a valley on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson went beyond what is allowed under a federal mining law. The appellate court cited the planned use of Coronado National Forest land for long-term storage of waste rock, not actual mining, and the lack of valuable minerals on that property. Hudbay Minerals officials said in a statement Thursday that they were reviewing the ruling and would continue to pursue alternative plans for mining part of the Rosemont copper deposit on nearby private lands. A coalition of environmental and tribal groups challenging the mining hailed the appellate court’s decision, the latest in a series of legal obstacles to the project. “This momentous decision makes it clear that Hudbay’s plan to destroy the beautiful Rosemont Valley is not only a terrible idea, it’s illegal,” said Allison Melton, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Hudbay has another mine project in the works on the western flank of the Santa Ritas.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A raccoon ran loose in the stands during Arkansas baseball’s Friday matchup with Vanderbilt, but a fan came to the rescue. Fayetteville native Grant Harmon grabbed the raccoon with his bare hands and held it up to cheers from the crowd at Baum-Walker Stadium as members of the Commodores’ bullpen looked on from left field. The incident was dubbed by fans on social media as the “rally raccoon,” as the Hogs came back to tie the game after being down 5-0 and then 6-5. Despite that, the rallies ultimately fell short as Vanderbilt won 9-6 in 10 innings. After grabbing the raccoon, Harmon continued to carry it out of the stadium. “The opportunity just came about, and I guess I just took action and grabbed it,” he said. “That was a first. I have no prior experience grabbing raccoons.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nModesto: The state will acquire a sprawling former farm property in the San Joaquin Valley and create a new state park for the first time in 13 years. Dos Rios Ranch, where the San Joaquin and Tuolumne rivers meet southwest of Modesto, will become California’s 280th state park and the first new one since Fort Ord Dunes near Monterey in 2009, the Modesto Bee reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday earmarked $5 million for the new park as part of his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1. The nearly 4-square-mile expanse featuring willows and valley oaks will be donated by River Partners, a conservation group that’s spent the past decade restoring the site. State Parks Director Armando Quintero said Friday that the property will serve “a park-poor region” – the San Joaquin Valley – and help address inequities in access to state recreation sites. “Everyone deserves to have close access to vibrant parks, and this opportunity is an exciting one,” Quintero said. Dos Rios could get trails, picnic areas, restrooms and other basics within five years, state parks officials said. Campgrounds could follow within another five years, the Bee reports.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is enacting a fire ban after a series of blazes have spread quickly in hot and dry conditions, including a fatal one caused by smoking. Under the ban taking effect Monday, smoking and grilling will be banned in parks in Colorado’s second-largest city. People grilling at home will only be able to use gas or liquid fuel, not charcoal or wood, and chain saws must have spark arresters. Welding or torching work may still be allowed but only with a permit, the Colorado Springs Fire Department said. A woman died in a fire Thursday at a mobile home park that was blamed on “the improper disposal of smoking materials,” city spokesperson Natashia Kerr said. Eight homes were destroyed. Under the ban, smoking materials must be disposed of in a non-combustible container with a lid. Meanwhile, a wildfire in the foothills southwest of the city that also started Thursday has burned 2.4 square miles. The fire near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was 27% contained Monday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former assistant police chief’s lawsuit claiming he was defrauded out of the police chief’s job can go forward, a state appeals court has ruled. James Nardozzi’s lawsuit stemmed from the hiring scandal that landed the city’s police chief and personnel director in prison last year. Nardozzi claimed former Chief Armando Perez and former personnel director David Dunn conspired with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim to fix the selection process so Perez would be selected as chief, the Connecticut Post reports. Prosecutors said Perez, 65, received confidential information about the police chief’s examination that was stolen by Dunn, including the questions for an oral examination and the scoring guide for written essays. Perez, who was the acting chief at the time, also admitted that he had two officers complete his essays, passed the work off as his own and lied to federal authorities in an effort to cover up his actions. Last April, Perez was sentenced to a year in prison, and Dunn received a four-month term. Both have since been released, according to the Courant. The appeals court ruled Friday that Nardozzi’s suit can proceed even though the city had paid him to settle a previous lawsuit after he was fired by Ganim in 2016. The case could go to trial later this year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases. A bill filed Friday would resurrect Delaware’s Firearm Transaction Approval Program, which was eliminated more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That vote came amid concerns then that Delaware’s background check system was not providing the federal NICS with information about mentally ill individuals prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The bill authorized state agencies to provide such information to NICS, created a federally mandated program allowing individuals previously deemed mentally ill to reestablish eligibility for gun ownership, and abolished the state’s existing background check system. Lawmakers now want to return responsibility for firearm transactions background checks in Delaware to the State Bureau of Identification. The SBI would be the point of contact between gun dealers and the federal databases checked by the FBI. The SBI would thus become responsible for determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm and would be able to search other databases other than NICS in making that determination.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In 100 years, if nothing is done, the historic Tidal Basin may be underwater, WUSA-TV reports. In 500, the Jefferson Memorial will be accessible only by boat. A combination of rising waters and a sinking human-made Tidal Basin puts the entire area – cherry blossoms, memorials, walking paths – at risk. But it’s not inevitable. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation have teamed up to create the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, an initiative to plan out what the reservoir could become in the next century. It was once just a part of the Potomac River, but after the great flood of 1881, city planners got to work dredging up the river and Washington Channel to build the Tidal Basin. Teresa Durkin, executive vice president for the Trust for the National Mall, said the gates that engineers installed to control the water flow are no longer doing their job. “The gates have actually silted shut. So the water keeps coming through, but with it, it’s bringing all this silt and debris. So over time, it literally cannot open and close anymore. It doesn’t function as it was designed to,” Durkin said. “A lot of that sediment, because it’s not flushing out of the out gates, is also settling in the Tidal Basin itself. So it has likely raised the water.”\n\nFlorida\n\nVero Beach: A food truck exploded during a seafood festival Saturday, sending one person to the hospital with severe burns, according to authorities. The Vero Beach police said state and local fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion. The department posted photos of the scene on Facebook that showed the sides and roof of the truck blown off the vehicle. One person was flown to a hospital burn unit in Orlando. There were no other injuries, and the festival continued as authorities secured the scene of the explosion, police said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of voters who challenged U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s eligibility to run for reelection said Monday that they have filed an appeal of the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that she can appear on the ballot. The five voters from Greene’s district in March filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger alleging that the Republican congresswoman played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. They argued that puts her in violation of a seldom-invoked part of the 14th Amendment having to do with insurrection and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot last month held a daylong hearing that included arguments from lawyers for the voters and for Greene, as well as extensive questioning of Greene herself. He then sent his decision to Raffensperger on May 6. Beaudrot found that the voters hadn’t produced sufficient evidence to back their claims. Raffensperger affirmed that decision, writing that whether Greene’s political statements and actions disqualify her from office “is rightfully a question for the voters of Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.” Under state law, the voters are allowed to appeal that decision in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines is exploring electric aircraft technology with an eye toward using the vehicles for interisland travel, Hawaii News Now reports. A Boston-based company called REGENT is designing “seagliders” that would each carry up to 100 people. Hawaiian hasn’t committed to purchasing any of the aircraft but is exploring the possibility. A news release from REGENT said Hawaiian agreed to strategically invest to support the initial design of the company’s next-generation seaglider. Hawaiian is the first airline to partner with the company, which hopes to have its Monarch seagliders in the air by 2028. “We look forward to working with REGENT to explore the technology and infrastructure needed to fulfill our vision for convenient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable interisland transportation,” said Avi Mannis, chief marketing and communications officer at Hawaiian Airlines. REGENT’s seagliders fly through the air close to the water’s surface. The company said the aircraft will service routes up to 180 miles with existing battery technology and routes up to 500 miles with next-generation batteries. The company said the seagliders will move at the speed of an airplane but have the operating cost of boats and will use existing dock infrastructure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have agreed to a $119 million settlement with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors over their role in the opioid addiction crisis. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said in an announcement Friday that it’s the second-largest consumer settlement in state history, trailing only the 1998 national tobacco settlement. An Ada County judge on Wednesday approved the settlement that includes all 44 Idaho counties, 24 cities and the state’s seven health districts. The money will address damage wrought by opioids, which the federal government declared a public health emergency in 2017. Johnson & Johnson and the three distributors agreed to a national $26 billion settlement in February. “Idaho has made significant strides in recent years in combatting the opioid crisis, and the culmination of our legal action against opioid manufacturers – led by Attorney General Wasden and his team – now offers additional resources,” Little said in a statement. Wasden is continuing legal action against other opioid makers as well as the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma. “This settlement holds some of those most responsible for the opioid crisis accountable and provides significant funding for treatment, recovery and prevention in Idaho,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened a citywide curfew for young people Monday, a day after she restricted access by unaccompanied minors to downtown’s Millennium Park following the weekend shooting death of a 16-year-old boy near “The Bean” sculpture at the park. The citywide weekend curfew for minors now will begin each night at 10 p.m., instead of the 11 p.m. curfew in place since the 1990s, Lightfoot said. At Millennium Park, which is a popular stop for tourists and Chicago residents, minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult. “We need to make sure they are safe and importantly that our young people understand and respect basic community norms, respect for themselves, respect for each other, and we must ensure that every one of our residents and visitors – no matter who they are or where they come from or how old they are – are able to safely enjoy our public spaces,” the mayor said at a news conference. Lightfoot said she hoped and expected that people would abide by the restrictions and that it would not lead to widespread arrests. She said officials “don’t want to arrest children,” but those who break the law will be.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville: A tiny community garden that provided 1,500 pounds of free food over five years to people in need was bulldozed by city crews after a nuisance call about overgrown grass. City officials said the lease with the nonprofit that managed the garden expired more than a year ago, and there was no sign that the land had been maintained since. The overgrown six parcels next to Southside Park posed a safety risk, officials said. Garden caretakers said they were in talks with the city about entering a new contract and weren’t given a warning the plot would be flattened and its furniture removed. Hidden underneath the pollinators and overgrowth were viable shrubs and plants, said Renee Rule, coordinator of the garden since its founding. The plot is messy when it’s not growing season but was a little more scraggly this year because bad weather had delayed volunteers who were to prepare it for planting, Rule said. “I wish they would have given us a call, and we could have saved some of the plants,” Rule said. The garden has provided free tomatoes, green beans, zucchini, onions and lettuces to neighborhood families and served as an instructional farm for college students and Girl Scouts alike. Families rented plots so they could grow vegetables to eat. Schoolchildren were given pumpkins in the fall. A beekeeper gave demonstrations at a beehive.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: School districts across the state are up against a federal deadline that will end a pandemic-era free meals program for students next month. While many school officials are waiting to see if federal or state lawmakers will extend the program, at least one district, Des Moines Public Schools, is working to continue offering most of its students free meals next school year. Students have faced repeated upheavals since March 2020, when schools across the country closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help districts feed students during the health crisis – whether they were at school or home – the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily relaxed rules that tied who received free lunch to family income and neighborhood poverty levels. As the June 30 deadline draws near, school district officials and school nutrition advocates are asking state and federal lawmakers to intervene by either extending the relaxed rules or offering free meals to all students permanently. If no legislation is passed, students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals will still receive those services. Educators and advocates stress that studies show students do better academically when they are not hungry. School meals reduce both hunger and anxiety about it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge is blocking a public school’s policy preventing teachers from outing transgender students to their parents after a teacher raised religious objections. Fort Riley Middle School math teacher Pamela Ricard sued USD 475 Geary County Schools over LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with her Christian beliefs. District Judge Holly Teeter issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the school from disciplining Ricard if she reveals preferred names and pronouns of her transgender students when communicating with their parents. “The Court relies on Plaintiff’s statements that she does not intend to communicate with a parent for the sole purpose of disclosing a student’s preferred name and pronouns,” Teeter wrote. Ricard has two transgender students in her class, the judge wrote, neither of whom has authorized the district to disclose a preferred name and pronouns to parents. While Ricard uses their preferred names in class and avoids pronouns, she has emailed parents using a student’s legal name and biological pronouns. “Plaintiff believes that addressing students one way at school and a different way when speaking to their parents is dishonest,” the opinion said. “Being dishonest violates her sincere religious beliefs.” Teeter was appointed by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: A judge entered a not guilty plea Monday for a man accused of fatally shooting the daughter of a former state lawmaker during a home invasion. Shannon Gilday, 23, appeared in Madison Circuit Court for a continued arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal mischief, news outlets report. His attorney tried to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill on his behalf last week, but the prosecution argued against it, and the judge continued the hearing. Meanwhile, prosecutors filed a notice of aggravating circumstances seeking enhanced penalties upon a conviction, which stopped defense attorney Tom Griffiths from trying to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill, news outlets report. Gilday allegedly broke into a multimillion-dollar Madison County home owned by former lawmaker C. Wesley Morgan and shot Jordan Morgan while she was asleep, according to court records and statements from Morgan. Gilday also exchanged shots with Morgan during the Feb. 22 break-in. State police investigators said Gilday told them he was determined to get access to a bunker in the home. He was arrested in Madison County about a week after the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Child drownings are on the rise in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Health, which says inability to swim, lack of supervision, and unfenced pools, spas and water bodies are top causes of drownings among babies and children under 15 years old. “As temperatures heat up and families return to water activities, it is important for parents and families to stay aware of the precautions they can take to prevent child drownings,” the department said in a news release. The agency said the number of drownings among children had fallen steadily for years, from 26 in 2015 and 2016 to 15 in 2019. But the total rose 60% in 2020, to 24. And preliminary data indicates that last year’s total was 25, it said. The department’s most recent Louisiana Child Death Review Report, covering 2017 through 2019, found that an average of 17 children drowned each year. That made drowning the No. 3 cause of injury-related death in children up through age 14, behind vehicle crashes and homicide. It found that 96% of them could not swim, 72% were unsupervised, and 54% died in water that hadn’t been fenced off. It found that 60% drowned in a pool, hot tub or spa. Looking at all drownings including adults, Louisiana had the nation’s third-highest rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed order from the state’s Board of Environmental Protection would let stand a permit issued for a $1 billion electric transmission corridor to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. The draft order was written by environmental agency staff ahead of a hearing this week that was postponed because of COVID-19 illnesses. The board was supposed to meet Tuesday to decide whether to hold a public hearing or to begin deliberations the following day. The permit was suspended by Maine Environmental Commissioner Melanie Loyzim after voters rebuked the project in a statewide referendum. Because the permit was not permanently revoked, the Board of Environmental Protection was required to issue a final decision on consolidated appeals. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, meanwhile, is weighing a lawsuit aimed at overturning the referendum on constitutional grounds, as well questions about the legality of a state lease for a small portion of land. Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the New England Clean Energy Connect would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower – enough electricity for 1 million homes – to the regional power grid. Supporters say bold projects are necessary to battle climate change. Critics say the benefits are overstated, and it would destroy woodlands.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has suffered a minor stroke and is being treated at George Washington University Hospital. The Maryland Democrat said he has been told there are no long-term effects or damage. In a statement Sunday night, Van Hollen said he has been advised by doctors to remain under observation at the Washington, D.C., hospital for a few days out of an abundance of caution. Van Hollen, 63, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving seven terms in the U.S. House. The senator said he experienced lightheadedness and acute neck pain while delivering a speech in western Maryland. On the advice of a physician, he sought medical attention upon his return home. An angiogram indicated a minor stroke in the form of a small venous tear at the back of his head, Van Hollen said. “I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Chelsea Millsap, 32, who can trace her ancestry to the Pilgrims, is the first woman named sexton in the nearly 300-year history of Boston’s Old North Church. The critical job involves caring for and maintaining the parish buildings and equipment, including an 18th-century clock, the 75-piece chandeliers and the crypt where more than 1,100 people have been laid to rest. One of her first tasks will be managing a major renovation and restoration of the crypt. The church, still home to an active Episcopal congregation, is famous as the place where in 1775, two lanterns in the steeple signaled British soldiers were heading to Concord and Lexington, sending Paul Revere on the ride that sparked the American Revolution. One of the people who hung the lanterns was Robert Newman, the sexton at that time. “What an incredible opportunity to be able to sit in the very same pew as Robert Newman and in a world that is so divided to work in a place that welcomes all people from Bostonians to world dignitaries, like the Queen,” Millsap, a Detroit native and former firefighter with experience in fire prevention, security technology and project management, said in a statement. “I could have been the one to hang the lanterns 247 years ago. It is such an honor to show women that they too can hold these sorts of jobs.” Millsap is a descendant of teenage Mayflower passenger Mary Chilton, buried at nearby King’s Chapel.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man walking on a footbridge to a Detroit Tigers game said he fell 15 feet to the ground when part of the concrete collapsed. Ely Hydes said the incident occurred May 9, but the bridge still was open until the Detroit News reached out to the state Transportation Department on Sunday. The Spruce Street pedestrian bridge is above M-10, also known as the Lodge Freeway. Hydes said he was walking to Comerica Park with a friend when “the bridge just collapsed under my feet.” “I remember thinking, ‘I hope I’m not over the freeway.’ I landed about 6 feet from the traffic. … After I hit the ground, I got the wind knocked out of me pretty good,” Hydes, 36, told the newspaper. He informed police, then resumed his walk to the Tigers game, a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Hydes went to a hospital a few days later. “I’m a giant walking bruise right now,” he said. The Transportation Department said it wasn’t aware of the hole in the bridge until notified by the newspaper. “The Spruce pedestrian bridge was built in 1953, and based on its age and condition, it is on a yearly detailed bridge inspection that is due this month,” spokeswoman Diane Cross said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLutsen: Communities in northeastern Minnesota are preparing to deal with more flooding and are calling for volunteers to help with sandbagging. Near Voyageurs National Park, most docks are underwater at area lakes, and some 200 homes and resorts are at risk. Kabetogama Township Supervisor John Stegmeir said his area is bracing for a record-breaking flood. Stegmeir said more volunteers are needed, especially since the average age of volunteers sandbagging right now is 65. The volunteers, along with some staff from Voyageurs National Park, have been working since last Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I think we’ve filled 8,000 bags this week, which isn’t big when you talk about the flooding on the Red River – they’re talking millions of bags – No. 1, we couldn’t do that, and the people who have been coming out to bag are older, you know,” he said. Volunteers are asked to check in at the town hall and to bring a shovel if possible. A flood warning is in effect for many communities in the Rainy River Basin of far northern Minnesota. In Cook County, the owner of Lutsen Resort on Lake Superior is hoping the iconic bridges on the property can be saved. Recent high water levels sent debris rushing down the Poplar River, damaging the bridges.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has revised its landlord-tenant law to give renters time to gather their belongings from a home before being forced to leave, after a federal judge ruled that the previous law was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills wrote in his Nov. 30 order that the old law was “unpredictable and absurd,” saying it went further than eviction laws in any other state. He wrote that it violated an occupant’s right to due process. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the new law April 21, and it took effect immediately. It passed with broad bipartisan support. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the new law gives a tenant seven days to gather belongings and vacate a home after an eviction notice. An exception is made for emergencies. If the occupant does not leave during the initial order, a judge could issue a separate one authorizing law enforcement to remove a tenant. That would give the person another 72 hours to gather their belongings. The previous law allowed landlords to immediately seize and dispose of a delinquent occupant’s personal property. The impetus for his order was a lawsuit by Samantha Conner, a Columbus woman who sued her landlord after he took nearly everything she owned when she was evicted in 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state has retained a dubious distinction for the 10th time, topping the Humane Society’s list of the worst puppy mill problem. In their annual list of worst dog breeders in the country, the advocacy group listed Missouri as having 26 of the most abusive puppy mills. Since the “Horrible Hundred” list was first published 10 years ago, Missouri has topped the list each year. This year the Show-Me State garnered 26 spots on the list, compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York, and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin. That Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin. “Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin said. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture, and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in Midwestern states, and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale puppy mills.” That evolution was aided by state regulations allowing the mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care, along with “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.” After the initiative was passed, the Legislature changed the language of the regulations.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: Little Big Horn College, a tribal college on the Crow Reservation, in partnership with the Crow Language Consortium, will host the 10th annual Crow Summer Institute on June6-24. The three-week program offers free Crow language and culture classes. Participants must be at least 18 years old, and registration is now open, according to a news release. The institute offers two options, one for beginners and one for intermediate learners. Learners will have access to resources developed by Crow elders, speakers and knowledge keepers, including textbooks, flashcards, dictionaries and multimedia apps. The Crow Summer Institute is offering $100 gas cards to some early registrants and Crow dictionaries for those who complete the program. Participants may also earn college credit through Little Big Horn College. Ishkoochìia Chiiakaamnáah (Jacob Brien), a Crow language learner who attended past Crow Summer Institutes, said the program helped him “realize different connections and patterns within the language.” “It really helped me understand Crow jokes and, by extension, Crow culture, which of course usually doesn’t translate, as many subtleties of the language don’t work in English,” he said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed by Terry Berry Jr.’s family against prison officials they argued were responsible for the 22-year-old’s death because they put him in the same cell as Patrick Schroeder, was dismissed last week after both sides agreed to the settlement. Berry was nearing parole on a sentence for forgery and assault when he was placed with Schroeder, who was serving a life sentence for killing a 75-year-old man and dumping his body in a well. The Lincoln Journal Star reports Schroeder later pleaded guilty to killing Berry and was sentenced to death. Berry’s family argued in the lawsuit that prison officials should have known there would be problems if they placed the two men together, and a caseworker at the prison even warned co-workers involved in the decision that Schroeder didn’t want a cellmate and wouldn’t likely tolerate Berry well because he was known to be “very talkative and bothersome.” Back in 2019, a federal judge dismissed the head of the state Department of Correctional Services and the prison’s warden as defendants, but the case had been allowed to move forward against several prison employees involved.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed ballot initiative seeks to amend the state constitution to establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, though it isn’t without its critics. The Nevada Voters First political action committee is spearheading the initiative and must collect 140,777 signatures from registered Nevada voters by June 29 to qualify the measure for the 2022 general election ballot. Approval in November would call on the Legislature to institute the changes to the Nevada Constitution by July 1, 2025. In ranked-choice balloting, voters are directed to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as they want. A voter may also choose only one candidate. The proposal would establish open primary elections, including all candidates regardless of party affiliation, squaring off in ranked-choice fashion. The top five finishers would advance to the general election, which would also be conducted using ranked-choice voting. About 30% of registered voters in Nevada list themselves as nonpartisan, and about 40% aren’t registered as Republican or Democrat, said Sondra Cosgrove, a representative with Nevada Voters First and a past president of the League of Women Voters of Nevada. “That’s a lot of people who are being shut out of important races,” she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former Trump administration official running for Congress did not violate state law by voting twice during the 2016 primary election season, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office said Thursday without taking a position on whether federal law was broken. The Associated Press reported in April that Matt Mowers cast ballots in both the Feb. 9, 2016, New Hampshire presidential primary and the New Jersey primary four months later. Legal experts said Mowers could have a violated federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” Though the article did not allege violation of state law, the attorney general’s office investigated based on the report and complaints from voters. After reviewing Mowers’ voting history, rental and property records, driver’s license documents and other material, it concluded he did not violate New Hampshire’s law against double voting. Mowers is a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st Congressional District, though New Hampshire has yet to complete its redistricting process and finalize the congressional map. He was the nominee in 2020 but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The Ocean County Board of Commissioners plans this week to wade into the contentious debate over the state’s new health and sex education curriculum. While the five-member, all-Republican board has no legal authority to determine what is taught in schools, its bully pulpit is seen as influential in a county that is a bastion of conservatism in an otherwise progressive state. Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, who is also a Republican National Committee member, circulated a draft resolution among her colleagues last Wednesday to establish a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” If approved as expected, the resolution would put the full weight of the county government behind a grassroots effort to establish such a bill of rights by providing political, administrative and legal support. The text of the draft resolution authorizes and directs the county commission director, the county administrator and county general counsel to organize parents, community leaders and unspecified professionals to develop the framework for such a document. The framework for such a declaration would then be used to marshal local school districts and county schools into adopting their own bills of rights.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s Asian American community is testing a new way to bolster security for Asian-owned businesses in the wake of two deadly shootings. KOAT-TV reports an Albuquerque startup is trying out an online service that connects armed security guards with Asian-owned businesses. Businesses would report suspicious activity to toServo. The service would utilize GPS-enabled mobile technology to put them in touch with a private security team, and the security on call would respond within minutes. It is part of an initiative established by the Asian Business Collaborative. The nonprofit started a Good Neighbor Program to check up on shops and restaurants. For now, four businesses will be chosen for the service. But there are hopes to expand its use by the end of the year. Collaborative organizers say the city’s Asian community has been on edge since shootings at two Asian-owned spas. In January, the female owner of one spa was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Two men have been charged in her killing. Less than a month later, another woman of Asian descent was killed inside another massage business during a robbery. The suspect was killed in a police pursuit 10 days later.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City health officials issued an advisory Monday urging New Yorkers to wear masks in all indoor public settings as the city approaches “high risk” COVID-19 alert status. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said everyone “regardless of vaccination status or past COVID-19 infection” should wear face coverings at all times in settings such as grocery stores, offices and building lobbies. People at high risk of severe illness from the virus, such as those over 65 years old, should avoid crowded settings and nonessential gatherings, he said. Vasan said he was issuing the guidance as the city approaches the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “high” level of COVID-19 alert, representing high community spread and increasing pressure on the health care system. New York City has been averaging about 3,600 reported new cases of COVID-19 per day over the past week – a number that is likely an undercount because it doesn’t include positive tests done at home. The daily case counts have been rising slowly since March but have leveled off somewhat recently. The CDC risk level for Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island is currently “medium,” while the Bronx is still “low.” But much of the surrounding metropolitan area has already moved into the CDC’s “high risk” category.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the shooting death of an endangered red wolf in North Carolina. The wolf was found in a muddy field in Tyrrell County on April 15, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The News & Observer reports it had been shot in the spine and collapsed in the mud – some of which was found in its lungs. Killing a red wolf is illegal, except under special circumstances. Red wolves once ranged across the Southeast, but after decades of habitat loss and killing by humans, they were nearly extinct by 1980. The Fish and Wildlife Service gathered up the remaining wild wolves and began a captive breeding program. The first captive wolves were reintroduced to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina in 1987. By 2006, as many as 120 red wolves were thought to be living in the wild. Since then, wolf populations have declined again. Last year, the Biden administration abandoned a proposal made under President Donald Trump to scale back the areas where red wolves are protected and allow the killing of wolves found outside federal land.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hoping to head off an explosion of electronic pull tab machines at gas stations and liquor, grocery and convenience stores, state regulators want to change the definition of a bar to make clear where the wildly popular Las Vegas-style games that mimic slot machines will be allowed. The state attorney general’s office, which oversees gambling in North Dakota, has identified a handful of gas stations and convenience stores that have begun selling and serving booze and are now “masquerading” as bars so that they can put the machines in their businesses, Attorney General Drew Wrigley said. Wrigley and Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator, said the idea for the rule change is to clarify and preserve what they believe the intent of the Legislature was when it defined a bar as a “retail alcoholic beverage establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed and consumed.” The amended language specifies that a bar does not include gas stations or liquor, grocery and convenience stores. A bar in a hotel, bowling alley or restaurant could still have the machines, under the new definition. The North Dakota Gaming Commission scheduled a Thursday meeting at the state Capitol to discuss the proposed changes and to take public comments.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state took the formal step of signaling interest in expanding Amtrak passenger rail in Ohio, though it is far from saying yes to the idea. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the Ohio Rail Development Commission to work with Amtrak to study potential new routes, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move was first reported by Cleveland.com. “It’s not to the point where we’re ready to go jump up and ‘yippee,’ but it’s significant, and we’re optimistic,” said Stu Nicholson with All Aboard Ohio, an advocacy group for rail. Amtrak wants to build a line connecting Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati. The company agreed to cover the cost of construction, track upgrades and operating costs for at least five years, then split the estimated $17 million to $20 million annual operating costs with the state. The roughly $100 million cost to build the line would come from a massive infrastructure package Congress passed into law. The approach could better entice Ohio to expand rail given much of the upfront cost will be covered, advocates said. Nicholson said recent guidance allows the state to use other sources outside its general revenue, such as private grants, to go toward its share.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: New laws signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt will increase funding for local enforcement of the medical marijuana industry and target illicit sales of cannabis. Each of the bills moved through the Legislature last week, and as a result county sheriffs are now able to receive grant funding to dedicate a full-time deputy to assist with compliance visits conducted by the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. The intent of the law is to allow enforcement officers to help the medical marijuana authority in situations where licensed cannabis businesses are not willing to allow inspections of their property. According to the bill’s authors, compliance inspectors were denied access 181 times between April 2021 and February of this year. “This bill is not meant to threaten anyone. We just want to make sure our compliance inspectors can safely do their jobs,” said state Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell, the House author. “This is a very important piece of legislation that will help rein in illegal marijuana operations and give Oklahomans the safe, fair, free market for medical marijuana that they voted for in 2018.” Logistics of the bill create a revolving fund, provided by the medical marijuana authority, that sets aside an annual $5 million for county sheriffs to dedicate an officer for one year to the medical marijuana authority.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Criminal defendants who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. The complaint, which seeks class-action status, was filed as state lawmakers and the Oregon Office of Public Defense Services struggle to address the huge shortage of public defenders statewide. The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide – including several dozen in custody on serious felonies – without legal representation. Crime victims are also affected because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that experts say extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system, especially among low-income and minority groups. “There is a public defense crisis raging across this country,” said Jason D. Williamson, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York University School of Law, who helped prepare the filing. “But Oregon is among only a handful of states that is now entirely depriving people of their constitutional right to counsel on a daily basis, leaving countless indigent defendants without access to an attorney for months at a time.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz is stepping up his criticism of far-right candidates gaining traction ahead of Tuesday’s primary election. After spending much of the campaign steering clear of fellow Republican Senate contender Kathy Barnette, Oz on Saturday said she was out of step with the GOP and would be unable to win the general election in November. In an interview, he took issue with a 2015 tweet from Barnette in which she wrote that “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.” Oz, who would be the nation’s first Muslim senator, described the comments as “disqualifying.” “It’s reprehensible that she would tweet out something that is defamatory to an entire religion,” Oz told the Associated Press. “This state was based on religious freedom. I’m proud as a Pennsylvanian to uphold those founding beliefs that every faith has its merits.” The Barnette campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week, Barnette told NBC News that she did not make the statement, which was still live on her Twitter feed Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A congressional candidate recently arrested on a menacing charge in another state has dropped out of the race. Michael Neary said in a statement Friday that he was seeking medical treatment for non-epileptic seizures following his arrest in Ohio in March. He said the decision followed “careful consultation and prayer.” Neary, 28, was among a large field of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District following incumbent Democrat Jim Langevin’s announcement in January that he’s retiring. Neary has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of menacing by stalking March 23, as well as drug counts after marijuana and drug paraphernalia were allegedly found in his car. He’s previously said he’d remain in the race despite the charges. The Columbus, Ohio, resident, who grew up in Rhode Island, was stopped by police after another driver reported having been followed from Columbus to Troy, more than 60 miles away. Police said the driver reported that Neary’s car mimicked their every move, matching speed and lane changes and even stopping at a rest area after they did. Authorities said Neary told them he had recently returned from Rhode Island, was very stressed and had been focusing on the vehicle’s Ohio registration.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Grace Church has purchased a dormitory building from Greenville Technical College to convert into affordable housing as part of a special program to address the local housing crisis. The church will serve as the landlord for the property, and rent will be adjusted to fit families’ income. Rent prices will range from $450 for a single room to $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The goal, according to Grace Church’s care and recovery ministry director LeeAnne Cavin, is that the average family will pay in the $900 range for a unit. “We do have a crisis of housing,” Cavin said. “Our whole community is really starting to desire collaboration.” The units are expected to open for rent the first week of June, and the church already has almost 40 families ready to move in. The program will accept emergency housing vouchers through the Greenville Housing Authority but not Section 8 vouchers or extra subsidy from the federal government that goes directly toward rent. To sign a lease in one of the units, families agree to be a part of a Grace Church housing program that offers medical coverage, dental care, a savings matching program, mental health support, car maintenance, financial education, cooking classes, self-defense classes, and job and interview preparation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The ongoing drought in South Dakota has been hard on the state’s wildlife. The U.S. Forest Service says the grouse population in the Fort Pierre National Grassland has declined by 15% in 2022, largely because of the dry conditions. The total grouse population has averaged about 300 since the mid-1980s. Over the past twenty years, both greater prairie chicken and sharp-tailed grouse populations have primarily remained stable or have grown. “The thing that I think was really damaging to us last year was we had record-high and record-dry conditions in early June, right when those birds started incubation or, for the earlier semester, to hatch. And, boy, that’s just so tough on a chick to thermoregulate and be able to find sufficient moisture,” District Ranger Dan Svingen said. Greater prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse both nest on the ground and require tall grass to hide their nests, the Capital Journal reports. Because they start laying eggs as early as April, before sufficient grass growth, they’re dependent on dead grass from the previous year as cover. However, the drought prevented extensive grass growth in 2021, leaving them more exposed to predators in 2022. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 76% of South Dakota is experiencing some kind of drought.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: In its quest to redefine tourism at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has inked a deal to bring an international entertainment company to the United States for the first time. Tribal Council and international theme park company Puy du Fou have signed a letter of intent to develop a new “spectacular immersive show” as part of a 200-acre development located at Exit 407 south of Interstate 40 on the way to the Smokies. The Tribal Council approved $75 million May 4 for phase one development of “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” Its leaders are seeking world-class attractions to appeal to the record-breaking crowds flocking to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The 407 partners have estimated the development could attract 6.7 million visitors in the first year after phase one is complete. That’s expected sometime in 2024. “We are excited to take the first steps towards developing this world-class attraction that will help support our nation economically while creating a new platform to share dimensions of Cherokee history many have never heard,” said Chairman of the Tribal Council Richard French. Puy du Fou is known worldwide for its immersive experiences inspired by history.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Two people were killed and three more taken to a hospital with injuries after a shooting Sunday at a bustling flea market, authorities said. The shooting at the open-air market arose from an “altercation” that involved at least two guns and all five of the people, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. He said no “innocent bystanders” were injured. Investigators believe one of the people hospitalized was among those who opened fire, and two more suspected shooters were detained at the scene, a sheriff’s deputy told KTRK-TV. Thousands of people were shopping at the market 14 miles north of Houston’s downtown when the shooting began around 1 p.m. Sunday, Gonzalez said on Twitter. The sheriff said multiple shots were fired, and deputies recovered two pistols from the scene. Authorities did not immediately provide further information about what led to the shooting but said all the people involved were men in there 20s who appeared to know each other.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A copper mining company will begin manufacturing a rare mineral used in solar panels that used to be discarded along with the other mine tailings. Rio Tinto officials and Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled the plan Wednesday at the Kennecott refinery west of Salt Lake City where the tellurium will be produced, FOX-13 news reports. The company says it is one of two in the U.S. to produce tellurium, which is listed as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. government. Most of the tellurium produced comes from China and other countries. Rio Tinto is working with the U.S. Department of Energy on ideas to produce more tellurium. The company said it hopes to produce 20 tons of the tellurium each year. “If we can produce it here, we are all going to be better off,” said Cox, a Republican. “We desperately need more of it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation into law Monday that creates an advisory committee to make recommendations on how to spend the state’s share of settlement money with drug manufacturers and distribution companies over the toll of prescription opioids. The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in Vermont jumped 33% in 2021 to a record 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported last month. The committee will be made up of the state’s health commissioner; a member each from the state Senate and House; health care providers; two people who lived through the experience of opioid use disorder; an assistant judge; and representatives from municipalities. Each year, the committee will make recommendations to the Vermont Department of Health and legislative committees for expenditures from a special opioid abatement fund. The health commissioner is expected to call the first meeting of the panel to occur on or before June 30.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A professor whose research on pedophilia created a stir at Old Dominion University has landed a new job with Johns Hopkins University’s Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Allyn Walker stepped down from ODU in November after using the phrase “minor-attracted person” instead of “pedophile” in research, leading to an outcry on campus and social media, as well as threats of violence. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Moore Center announced last week that Walker, who uses the pronoun they, would be joining the center as a postdoctoral fellow. The center said in a series of tweets that it was excited to welcome Walker and that they would be working on research and new projects to develop a “comprehensive public health approach to addressing child sexual abuse and effective prevention programs.” On its website, the center says it works “to change the way the world thinks about child sexual abuse, from inevitable to preventable.” In the series of tweets, the center referred to Walker as “a leader in the field of perpetration prevention research.” Walker was an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice before more than 15,500 people signed an online petition calling for their removal from ODU in the fall. That came after a controversial interview about “A Long, Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity,” a book focused on people who do not act on their sexual attraction to children and strategies to prevent them from acting on the attraction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak will postpone restoring its Cascades passenger-train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., until possibly December because of a lack of personnel. The service gap occurred despite the Biden administration’s much-hyped $66 billion allotted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to catch up on maintenance and spread Amtrak’s national railway service to new cities, The Seattle Times reports. Janet Matkin, rail spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said transportation officials in the state hoped the trains would roll again by summer or even late spring. Amtrak doesn’t have enough conductors, mechanics and onboard service staff yet to operate the trains, though new classes of conductors are in training, according to a letter to Washington and Oregon rail directors from Ray Lang, an Amtrak vice president. Pre-pandemic, about 159,000 people per year rode between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., or 290,000 when including stations between the cities, Matkin said. Passenger fares traditionally cover about two-thirds of operation costs, while states cover the rest.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: Gov. Jim Justice visited the site of a planned $147 million highway project that will connect Welch to the Coalfields Expressway. The 5-mile stretch of highway is expected to be completed in 2026. “This announcement today means we are one step closer to bringing this area of West Virginia to the world once and for all,” Justice said in a media release. “We have waited and waited in southern West Virginia for way too long.” Justice announced Friday that Bizzack Construction of Lexington, Kentucky, won the bid to build the new highway. The governor’s office said plans are in the works to build a 5-mile stretch of the Coalfields Expressway from Mullens to Twin Falls State Park and a 3-mile link from Twin Falls toward Pineville. The four-lane Coalfields Expressway that runs from Raleigh County to Wyoming County opened in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSparta: The popular Elroy-Sparta State Trail officially reopened over the weekend following several years of flood-related repairs. Summer flood damage in 2018 closed the 32-mile-long trail which had about 60,000 visitors a year. The state Department of Natural Resources said the western Wisconsin trail needed two complete bridge replacements and landslide repairs, among other work. According to the DNR, $2.3 million needed for repairs came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state. State Sen. Howard Marklein, of Spring Green, and state Rep. Tony Kurtz, of Wonewoc, spearheaded efforts in the Legislature to secure funds for the trail’s repairs, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “The easy part was the funding,” the DNR’s Missy VanLanduyt said. “The more difficult part was just the sheer amount of infrastructure that needed to be replaced, and designing all of that, and then going through the bidding process and then finally a very long construction period as well.” While repair work is largely complete, a 1-mile section of the trail was closed as of Friday because of bridge safety concerns. VanLanduyt said it’s set to reopen after Memorial Day weekend, with a permanent bridge replacement coming in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis apologized Monday after getting booed and heckled for remarks she made on sexual identity during a University of Wyoming graduation speech. A first-term Republican from deep-red Wyoming, Lummis said in Saturday’s speech in Laramie that human rights are derived from God but that government seeks to redefine many of them. “Even fundamental, scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes, male and female, are subject to challenge these days,” Lummis said. She paused and smiled while many in the crowd responded with boos and heckling. “And I challenge those of you,” she said, without completing that thought, saying: “I’m not making a comment on the fact that there are people who transition between sexes.” Lummis is a former congresswoman, state treasurer and University of Wyoming graduate who’s been prominent in Wyoming politics for decades. Until now, at least, she has been less outspoken than many Republicans who’ve made a major issue of gender and sex identity. The stir happened in a community known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a watershed event in LGBTQ activism. A college town of about 32,000 people, Laramie leans left compared to the vast majority of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/opinions/bjp-hindu-muslim-democracy-modi-arundhati-roy/index.html", "title": "Arundhati Roy: 'The damage to Indian democracy is not reversible ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arundhati Roy is the author of “The God of Small Things,” which won the Booker Prize in 1997 and “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness,” which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2017.

Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India’s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved – one of whom later withdrew her remarks – faced disciplinary action.\n\nBut for India’s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident.\n\nRather, they were the culmination of the BJP’s “engineering hatred of a common enemy,” says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy.\n\n“India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there.

India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,” she told CNN.\n\n“Many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror.\n\n“Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?” writes Roy.\n\nIn this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with.\n\nCNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials’ comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today?\n\nRoy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We’re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India – the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India.\n\nCNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS?\n\nRoy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers.\n\nIt has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women’s organizations. It’s not a political party, it’s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it’s a nation within a nation.\n\nThe RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the “nation-state of the Jewish people.”\n\nA demonstration against the state government demolition of the house of a local Muslim leader in Prayagraj on June 13. The demolition followed clashes after controversial remarks made by two BJP officials about the Prophet Mohammed. Amarjeet Kumar Singh/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, the RSS believes in what it calls “Akhand Bharat,” a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once – a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India.\n\nFirst in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians – a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated.\n\nIn the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous.\n\nThere is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of “legacy papers,” which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country.\n\nBut isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry.\n\nApart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples’ homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims – and videos demonstrating how it should be done.\n\nWe regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest.\n\nTo flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities… into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process Arundhati Roy\n\nSome of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate.\n\nAs a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP’s favor.\n\nCNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it?\n\nRoy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead.\n\nModi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, pictured here on June 6, has not publicly commented on the recent BJP officials' comments about the Prophet Mohammed. T. Narayan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi.\n\nModi was unapologetic and came to be known as “Hindu Hriday Samrat” – the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since – he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader.\n\nCNN: Over the years, Modi’s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that?\n\nRoy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate.\n\nAfter Modi’s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic – the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave – some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, “Without Modi, it would have been worse.”\n\nThey’ve swallowed the story they’ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops.\n\nCNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action?\n\nRoy: I don’t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as “Vishwa-Guru,” the Guru of the Whole World.\n\nBarack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality.\n\nIf India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure.\n\nRight now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India’s proximity to Russia. So, India’s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am.\n\nCNN: How should India’s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?)\n\nRoy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India’s “Muslim trading partners” have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state.\n\nIndia’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate – and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable.\n\nAs for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense “market” will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes.\n\nCNN: Is India truly the world’s largest democracy?\n\nRoy: A democracy doesn’t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder.\n\nCNN: The damage done to Indian democracy – is it reversible?\n\nRoy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level.\n\nMuslim demonstrators at a protest demanding the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) official Nupur Sharma following her comments about the Prophet Mohammed, in Kolkata on June 10. Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters\n\nThe whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that’s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks.\n\nAnd, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that’s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes.\n\nSo, no, I don’t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what’s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then… God help us.\n\nCNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large?\n\nRoy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a ‘success’ when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do?\n\nI am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier – one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party’s going really well and everyone’s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically – which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? Arundhati Roy\n\nThe idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of “anti-nationals.” Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father’s father. But this doesn’t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that.\n\nSadly, the BJP’s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp – or smile out loud. The song that breaks your heart.\n\nCNN: What kind of India would you like to see – and how do we get there?\n\nRoy: My dreams are not, and never have been, limited by the shape of the map of India, or any country. They’ve always been either much smaller or much bigger. The dream worth dreaming is to see our world moving toward a shared understanding of justice, however slowly, instead of racing away from it at the pace we are.", "authors": ["Arundhati Roy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/india/rishi-sunak-india-british-ties-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What do Indians think about Rishi Sunak's rise?

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nWho is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nThe uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nWhen he took his parliamentary oath in 2019, Sunak clutched the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. He made history a year later when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nNow he is at the pinnacle of power – and that, analysts say, is the epitome of the diaspora’s success.\n\nPant, from the Observer Research Foundation, said Sunak’s appointment symbolizes how people of South Asian descent have “cut across political parties in the UK,” adding Sunak “will shape the political trajectory” of Britain.\n\n“I think there is a certain comfort level that people of the Indian diaspora have in these democracies,” Pant said. “And that is reflective of the largest success of India globally.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2022/08/22/indiana-state-football-players-killed-car-crash/7865300001/", "title": "Two Indiana State football players among three killed in car crash", "text": "Two Indiana State University football players were killed in a single-vehicle accident a few miles from campus during the weekend, the school confirmed Monday.\n\nChristian Eubanks, 18, and Caleb VanHooser, 19 -- both freshmen on the Sycamores football team -- were among five people in a car that crashed early Sunday morning in Riley, Indiana.

Nowhere is that more true than in Russia, where the Kremlin has engaged in a campaign of false advertising to sell its invasion of Ukraine to the public.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin cast the campaign as a “special military operation” – not a war – and told citizens that they could, essentially, forget about the conflict in Ukraine. Draftees, he promised falsely, would not fight, and military operations would be left to the professionals. And Putin’s Ministry of Defense delivered platitudes about progress on the battlefield, talking points quickly parroted by Russian state television.\n\nBut a curious shift is underway in Russia’s tightly controlled information space. Ukraine’s military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive, making it increasingly difficult to conceal the Russian military’s losses. And Putin last month declared a partial military mobilization, sending a message to the general population that their leader was going all in Ukraine, and that sacrifices are now in order.\n\nAgainst that background, Russia has seen some unusual public criticism of the top brass running Putin’s war. Within limits, of course: Criticizing the war itself or Russia’s commander-in-chief is off limits, but those responsible for carrying out the President’s orders are fair game.\n\nIn a recent interview with Russian arch-propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, the head of the defense committee in Russia’s State Duma demanded that officials cease lying and level with the Russian public.\n\n“First of all, we need to stop lying,” said Andrei Kartopolov, a former colonel-general in the Russian military and a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. “We brought this up many times before … But somehow it’s apparently not getting through to individual senior figures.”\n\nKartapolov complained that the Ministry of Defense was evading the truth about incidents such as Ukrainian cross-border strikes in Russian regions neighboring Ukraine.\n\n“Our Russian city of Valuyki… is under constant fire,” he said. “We learn about this from all sorts of folks, from governors, Telegram channels, our war correspondents. But no one else. The reports from the Ministry of Defense do not change in substance. They say they destroyed 300 rockets, killed Nazis and so on. But people know. Our people are not stupid. But they don’t want to even tell part of the truth. This can lead to a loss of credibility.”\n\nValuyki is in Russia’s Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine. Kyiv has generally adopted a neither-confirm-nor-deny stance when it comes to striking Russian targets across the border.\n\nSome criticism has also come from Russian-appointed quislings who have been installed by Moscow to run occupied regions of Ukraine. In a recent four-minute rant on the messaging app Telegram, the Russian-appointed deputy leader of Ukraine’s occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, lambasted Russian military commanders for allowing “gaps” on the battlefield that had allowed the Ukrainian military to make advances in the region, which is illegally claimed by Russia.\n\n“There is no need to somehow cast a shadow over the entire Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation because of some, I do not say traitors, but incompetent commanders, who did not bother, and were not accountable, for the processes and gaps that exist today,” Stremousov said. “Indeed, many say that the Minister of Defense [Sergei Shoigu], who allowed this situation to happen, could, as an officer, shoot himself. But, you know, the word officer is an unfamiliar word for many.”\n\nA provocative statement, perhaps – Stremousov might perhaps be mindful of the fact that troublesome leaders of Russian-backed separatist entities have a habit of dying violently – but some of this criticism is not new. Just weeks after Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one of his key domestic enforcers, Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, urged the Russian military to expand its campaign, implying that Moscow’s approach had not been brutal enough.\n\nBut after Russia’s retreat from the strategic Ukrainian city of Lyman, Kadyrov has been a lot less shy about naming names when it comes to blaming Russian commanders.\n\nWriting on Telegram, Kadyrov personally blamed Colonel-General Aleksandr Lapin, the commander of Russia’s Central Military District, for the debacle, accusing him of moving his headquarters away from his subordinates and failing to adequately provide for his troops.\n\n“It’s not a shame that Lapin is mediocre, but the fact that he is covered at the top by the leaders in the General Staff,” said Kadyrov.\n\nThe US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War noted that Russian battlefield setbacks, coupled with the unease in Russian society over mobilization, “was fundamentally changing the Russian information space.” That has included robust criticism not just from hawkish men of power such as Kadyrov, but from pro-war milbloggers who have often provided a granular picture of battlefield realities for Russian forces.\n\n“The Russian information space has significantly deviated from the narratives preferred by the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) that things are generally under control,” ISW noted in its recent analysis.\n\n“The current onslaught of criticism and reporting of operational military details by the Kremlin’s propagandists has come to resemble the milblogger discourse over the past week. The Kremlin narrative had focused on general statements of progress and avoided detailed discussions of current military operations. The Kremlin had never openly recognized a major failure in the war prior to its devastating loss in Kharkiv Oblast, which prompted the partial reserve mobilization.”\n\nOne of the central features of Putinism is a fetish for World War II, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War. And those in Russia’s party of war often speak admiringly of the brutal tactics employed by the Red Army to fight Hitler’s Wehrmacht, including the use of punishment battalions – sending soldiers accused of desertion, cowardice or wavering against German positions as cannon fodder – and the use of summary execution to halt unauthorized retreats.\n\nKadyrov – who recently announced that he had been promoted by Putin to the rank of colonel general – has been one of the most prominent voices arguing for the draconian methods of the past. He recently said in another Telegram post that, if he had his way, he would give the government extraordinary wartime powers in Russia.\n\n“Yes, if it were my will, I would declare martial law throughout the country and use any weapon, because today we are at war with the whole NATO bloc,” Kadyrov said in a post that also seemed to echo Putin’s not-so-subtle threats that Russia might contemplate the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd that’s the worrying thing. In Russia’s bellicose information space, the talk isn’t about ending a horrific and wasteful war: It’s about correcting the mistakes that forced a Russian retreat, reinforcing discipline, and doubling down in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/10/08"}]}

Leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, the sector hit hardest by COVID-19, led the job gains with 96,000. Professional and business services added 89,000 jobs; health care, 70,000; construction, 32,000; manufacturing, 30,000; and retail, 22,000 jobs.\n\nFederal, state and local governments added 57,000 jobs.\n\nThe employment recovery, however, masks divergent narratives for the public and private sectors. While businesses recouped all jobs lost in June and are now 629,000 positions above the pre-COVID-19 level, government is still nearly 600,000 jobs below that benchmark.\n\nThat’s mostly because state and local governments haven’t been able to provide the pay increases, remote work options and flexible hours offered by the private sector since the pandemic began in spring 2020.\n\nIn addition to July's robust payroll gains, average hourly earnings rose 15 cents to $32.27, pushing the annual increase from 5.1% to 5.2% and threatening to intensify inflation pressures.\n\nAnd the portion of Americans working or looking for jobs fell from 62.2% to 62.1%, well below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%. That share had been rising as workers returned to a favorable labor market after caring for children or staying idle because of COVID-19 fears. But it has broadly edged down after hitting a peak in March, suggesting widespread labor shortages could persist and push pay increases higher.\n\nOverall, the blockbuster report increases the odds that the Fed will raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage for a third straight meeting in mid-September to fight soaring inflation, says economist Michael Pearce of Capital Economics.\n\nInflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June. The higher prices and borrowing costs have led consumers and businesses to slow spending and have stoked recession fears.\n\nThe labor market, however, remarkably has shrugged off the inflation spike, rising interest rates and an economy that has contracted for two straight quarters, adding an average 437,000 jobs a month since May. Because of the labor shortages, companies have been hesitant to let workers go and continue to add staffers to meet the demands of a reopening economy.\n\nJason Scott plans to bring on about 25 new employees this year at 120VC, his company that manages projects for businesses, and three at Brick & Matter, his marketing firm. Despite the recession chatter, clients are still catching up after scrapping projects during the pandemic, he says. Plus, he says, the recent flurry of layoffs have provided him a fresh pool of talented employees.\n\n“I’m going to roll the dice,” he says.\n\nThere are signs the job market could soon soften. Last week, initial jobless claims, a gauge of layoffs, rose to the highest level since November based on a four-week moving average. Tech giants such as Oracle, Amazon, Netflix and Robinhood have announced significant job cuts recently. And job openings fell to a still-strong 10.7 million in June from a near-record 11.3 million the previous month.\n\nAlso, payroll growth is expected to downshift now that the U.S. has recouped all 22 million jobs lost in the health crisis.\n\nSome employers are dialing back their hiring plans.\n\nMichael Hobbs, president of Chicago-based PahRoo Appraisal & Consultancy, had planned to add about 20 employees this year.

Johnson\n\nIn the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty ruled the day for Wisconsin businesses and workers. Even as vaccines were becoming widely available in the spring of last year, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Secretary Missy Hughes worried about the fate of the state’s many small businesses, especially those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n“We’re potentially looking at losing 20 to 30 percent of these small businesses,” she warned during a virtual event with Marquette University Law School in March of 2021.\n\nToday, it appears that worst-case scenario didn’t materialize. In a recent interview with us, Hughes cited several encouraging signs, including a 42% increase in new businesses formed during the pandemic. A torrent of state and federal aid — WEDC alone gave grants of $600 million to small businesses — combined with the grit and creativity of owners and workers averted an economic catastrophe. While the virus remains a concern, the greatest challenges facing most businesses right now are workforce shortages and inflation.\n\nMilwaukee is on the mend, but with a ways to go\n\nHas the economy fully recovered, or have we settled into a kind of new normal? More specifically, how is the economy of the state’s largest city and most populous county, Milwaukee, faring more than two years after the start of the pandemic? With two-thirds of the metropolitan area’s approximately 1.5 million residents living in Milwaukee County, its performance remains central to the region’s economic vitality.\n\nMore:Milwaukee businesses held on better than expected during pandemic, but the 'new normal' remains a challenge\n\nNew analysis done as part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette University Law School’s Lubar Center shows an economy on the mend, but not yet fully recovered from the pandemic’s fallout. Among our findings:\n\n• There does not appear to be a mass exodus from the labor force in the city of Milwaukee, but unemployment remains higher than it was before the pandemic.\n\n• Milwaukee County saw the number of business establishments actually increase from 2019 to 2021, but the number of employees across nearly all major sectors of the economy was down from two years ago.\n\n• Employment in some industries declined in 2020 but began to rebound in 2021. Others declined two years in a row, suggesting longer-lasting changes to the local economy.\n\n• Employment in some of the county’s best-paying sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. That includes manufacturing and the professional and business service sectors.\n\n• As expected, the leisure and hospitality industry was hardest hit by the pandemic. Employment declined by 31% from 2019 to 2020. The sector has recovered somewhat, but employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n• While restaurant employment fell, the total number of restaurants in the city of Milwaukee grew in 2021, a phenomenon fueled by strong growth among caterers and food trucks.\n\n• Businesses, non-profits, local governments, and individuals in Milwaukee County benefited greatly from the federal government’s financial assistance during the pandemic. For example, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) sent $2.3 billion to employers across the county and $1.9 billion of that amount went to entities in Milwaukee.\n\nLet’s look at the employment picture first.\n\nMilwaukee unemployment rate is still relatively high\n\nSince the Great Recession, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has consistently been slightly lower than the national rate. But for decades, Milwaukee’s unemployment rate has been consistently higher than both the state’s and the nation’s. Far from changing this basic dynamic, the economic recovery appears to have exacerbated the gap between Milwaukee and the rest.\n\nIn May of 2019, prior to the pandemic, U.S. unemployment was 3.4%. It was 3.1% in Wisconsin and 4.2% in Milwaukee.\n\nUnemployment spiked for all three in 2020, as the pandemic took hold and governments took steps to address a public health emergency. In April of 2020, unemployment stood at 14.4% nationally, 14.1% in Wisconsin, and 16.7% in Milwaukee.\n\nBut by May of this year, the U.S. and Wisconsin unemployment rates had returned, or even improved on, pre-pandemic levels. Not so for Milwaukee. Its 4.9% unemployment rate was nearly a full percentage point higher than May of 2019.\n\nTo count as unemployed, people must be looking for work. People who have left the workforce entirely don’t factor into the unemployment rate. But our analysis does not suggest a mass exodus from the labor force. In fact, the city of Milwaukee’s labor force in May of this year was 273,000, slightly higher than in 2019.\n\nThe number of unemployed people in Milwaukee was estimated to be 13,300 in May of this year. That’s down from 20,000 in May of 2021, but still higher than any other year since 2016.\n\nOne striking finding of our analysis was that almost none of the sectors in the Milwaukee County economy had fully recovered from the pandemic. The best source for employment data by sector is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Because these reports have a six-month lag time, they do not capture the most recent changes in employment. But they do give us our best and most reliable sense of which parts of the local job market are growing and shrinking. The numbers are only available on the county level, and we only discuss private-sector workers — leaving aside government employment.\n\nLeisure hospitality workers hit hard\n\nNot surprisingly, the leisure and hospitality industry was hammered by the pandemic. Employment fell from 48,000 to 33,000 in the first year of the pandemic. As of December 2021, employment had only partially recovered to 42,000.\n\nRestaurant employees were hit especially hard. In the first year of the pandemic, full-service restaurants shed 33% of their workforce, nearly 4,900 workers. By December of 2021, just under 2,600 had been added back.\n\nLikewise, food service contractors lost about half their jobs in 2020, with only about half of that recovered in 2021.\n\nHigher paying occupations also struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels. The manufacturing sector in Milwaukee County saw employment decline by 4,000 in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and 2021 showed a modest recovery of 700 workers.\n\nIn recent years, we have written about one of the bright spots in the Milwaukee economy, the growth of employment in the “management of companies and enterprises” sector in the last 20 years. New data suggests the pandemic may have interrupted or even halted that trend. During the first year of the pandemic, the number of employees in this industry fell by more than 1,000. The industry lost 400 more in 2021. Since these are generally prestigious, desirable, high-paying jobs, it raises the possibility that some of these positions are leaving Milwaukee entirely.\n\nOther continued employment declines in 2021 may reflect a tight labor market for certain kinds of workers, not a lack of open positions. For instance, employment in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health care all fell in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nAs the pandemic forced Americans to change their shopping habits, employment in a few industries increased. The most dramatic example can be found in the general warehousing and storage industry. Employment has more than doubled since 2019, gaining over 2,500 jobs. The number of employees working in construction by the end of 2021 also grew, slightly exceeding its 2019 benchmark.\n\nNumber of business establishments is up\n\nEmployment is one way to measure the recovery from the pandemic. Another is looking at the number of business establishments, or workplaces. Perhaps counterintuitively, the number of establishments grew while employment fell.\n\nSometimes, this reflects changes in where people worked. The federal Department of Health and Human Services used pandemic relief funding to encourage growth in home-based care for the elderly and disabled. Similarly, the number of child day care establishments grew even while employment in these places fell. Possibly, this reflects a growing preference for smaller providers.\n\nOther cases of substantial establishment growth were among professionals and skilled trades, often related to shipping or housing, including marketing consultants, real estate agents, truckers, home remodelers, insurance agents, landscapers, and drywall contractors.\n\nStarting a business during a pandemic takes a lot of planning, and a leap of faith. But some entrepreneurs did just that in 2020 and 2021, even in the kinds of service sector industries most disrupted by the pandemic. With the help of the Milwaukee City Clerk’s office, we created a unique dataset by matching business license recipients for tavern, restaurant and grocery activities in the city.\n\nAfter a decline in 2020, most of those businesses showed a strong recovery in 2021. Compared to 2019, there were 6% more restaurants at the end of 2021. That was driven by strong growth among caterers and mobile food trucks. These two categories grew 47% since the pandemic began.\n\nThe ranks of large grocery stores were largely unaffected by the pandemic.\n\nA few gas stations closed in 2020, but their numbers recovered in 2021.\n\nConvenience stores recovered incompletely in 2021, but the data suggests their decline may predate the pandemic.\n\nBars and coffeeshops have struggled. The number of taverns — drinking establishments that don’t serve anything more complicated than frozen pizza — fell in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nLikewise, a half-dozen coffeeshops closed in 2020, with no recovery in 2021.\n\nThe impact of Upstart Kitchen, Sherman Phoenix\n\nSome parts of the city, including the 1st aldermanic district on the far north and 2nd aldermanic district on the northwest sides, saw significant declines in licensed bars, coffee shops and restaurants. These areas were also hard hit by the housing crisis of the Great Recession.\n\nWith fewer people working in office towers and less street traffic, the 4th aldermanic district downtown also saw a decline in these kinds of licenses.\n\nMore:Upstart kitchen, in Sherman Park, has a line of entrepreneurs eager to start food businesses\n\nIn contrast, Milwaukee’s 14th district, home to the Bay View neighborhood, saw an increase in licenses for restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores.\n\nEven more entrepreneurial activity occurred in Milwaukee’s 7th aldermanic district during the last two years. Located on the north side and including the Sherman Park neighborhood, the 7th added 31 new licenses, the vast majority for new restaurants.\n\nDigging a little deeper, the 7th saw an increase of at least 14 catering businesses and five mobile restaurant bases (the kitchen associated with one or more food trucks).\n\nMore:A hub for Black entrepreneurs pushes for sustainable change\n\nMuch of this burst of entrepreneurial activity can be attributed to Upstart Kitchen, a food business incubator which offers commercial kitchen space to new businesses. The shared space at 43rd and Fond du Lac is located less than a mile from the Sherman Phoenix development, which has been another source of small business growth in the 7th district.\n\nBillions in federal dollars flow into the region\n\nAs we wrote this piece, we couldn’t help but wonder about the local impact of federal assistance received during the pandemic, an impact that can now be measured in the billions of dollars. Here are numbers from a few of the biggest aid programs. To help give a sense of scale, total wages paid by all nonfarm employers in Milwaukee County added up to $26.9 billion in 2019, $26.7 billion in 2020, and $28.3 billion in 2021.\n\nUsing census data to find the eligible population, we estimate that Milwaukee County residents received about $2.2 billion directly from the three pandemic-related stimulus checks. Expanded child tax credits in 2021 paid Milwaukee County families around $240 million in total.\n\nOur calculations suggest that the various temporary expansions of federal unemployment benefits added over $700 million to the checks of unemployed Milwaukee workers across the 1.6 million weekly claims made during the eligible months. Emergency rent relief in Milwaukee County totaled about $60 million through the first half of 2022.\n\nOther stimulus efforts supported the private sector. The largest was the Paycheck Protection Program, which allowed small businesses to apply for low-interest (often forgivable) loans that could be used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities.\n\nData from the Small Business Administration indicates the PPP paid out $2.3 billion to Milwaukee County businesses and non-profits, of which $1.9 billion went to the city of Milwaukee. $1.7 billion of the citywide loans have been forgiven.\n\nThe majority of PPP loans made to Milwaukee businesses appears to have gone to individuals. Of the more than 25,000 loans made in Milwaukee, 55% went to either sole proprietorships, independent contractors, self-employed individuals, or single member LLCs.\n\nCollectively, these recipients got $222 million in loans, of which $143 million has been forgiven to date. This rate of loan forgiveness — 64% — is much less than the rates achieved by other kinds of borrowers. For example, the forgiveness rate for corporations is 96%.\n\nMost of those corporations obtained their loans with the help of well-known banks. In contrast, thousands of the loans to individuals were processed through less well-known financial institutions located in places like California, Arizona, and Florida. Some of these loan originators have forgiveness rates as low as 49%.\n\nThe role government played in responding to a deadly virus will be debated for some time. What can be said is that the worst fears of top state officials were not realized.\n\nIn Milwaukee County, two years after the pandemic began, most Milwaukee County businesses are still in business. In fact, there are more business establishments today than there were two years ago.\n\nBut that masks the other story revealed by the data: At the start of this year, nearly every major sector of the local economy had fewer total employees than before the pandemic began. In Milwaukee County, at least, the recovery remains a work in progress.\n\nMike Gousha is senior advisor in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School.

Now port congestion and delays are back and could be around for a while.\n\nCovid lockdowns in China have wreaked havoc at Shanghai, the world’s biggest container port, and are now causing problems at other major ports around the world.\n\nSome Chinese cities, including Shanghai, have started easing Covid restrictions in recent days, but experts say that the damage has already been done, and global shipping will suffer well into the summer. That could exert even more pressure on global supply chains already reeling from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and keep inflation running hot.\n\nData from Project44, which tracks global supply chains, showed that shipment delays between China and major US and European ports have quadrupled since late March, when China shut down the city of Shanghai, which has the world’s busiest container port.\n\nA Cosco Shipping container ship is seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Shanghai, China April 24, 2022. Str/Reuters\n\nBy the end of April, ships from China to Seattle were taking four days longer than expected to arrive, up from about one day the previous month.\n\nThe time it takes ships to leave China and arrive at major ports around the world increased steadily over the past year, but there had been some signs of relief since December with transit times between Shanghai and Long Beach, for example, dropping in January and February.\n\nSince March, however, there’s been a sharp increase again in transit times on that route.\n\nTo add to the problem, many truck drivers have struggled to reach ports in China to pick up containers because of travel restrictions and Covid testing requirements. Shipping giant Maersk warned in an advisory last month that trucking services in Shanghai would be “severely” impacted by these restrictions.\n\n“With the manufacturing industry being shuttered [in Shanghai] and truckers unable to travel quickly, exports have been reduced, and shipment delays have increased,” said Josh Brazil, director of Supply Chain Data Insights at Project44.\n\nDelays will “continue into the summer months,” as factories struggle to return to normal operations in Shanghai, he added.\n\nAlthough authorities have allowed some businesses to restart production, many workers are still stuck in quarantine at home. Factories that do reopen are facing component shortages and difficulty in securing trucks to carry goods into or out of the port.\n\n“The ripples in shipment delays are only beginning to become visible and are expected to extend well into the next few months,” said Brazil.\n\nShanghai — China’s leading financial center and most populous city — has been under a strict lockdown since late March. More than 8 million residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The Covid restrictions have spread to other cities, including Beijing — the nation’s capital.\n\nShanghai port remained open throughout the lockdown, but data from various shipping firms show an increasing backlog of ships and containers.\n\nUS supply chain companies have expressed concerns about fresh chaos heading towards American ports, which are still recovering from the severe congestion and delays they suffered last year.\n\nShelley Simpson, chief commercial officer for JB Hunt Transport Services, said late last month that while there has been “a temporary relief” at US ports, things may get a lot “a lot worse” this summer because of what’s happening in China.\n\nIt “just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again,” she added.\n\nShips and containers jam the ports\n\nShipping queues are getting worse in China — and other parts of the world.\n\nNearly 20% of container vessels globally are currently waiting outside congested ports, according to a survey published last Thursday by Windward, an Israel-based global maritime data firm.\n\nAlmost a quarter of those unberthed ships are stuck outside Chinese ports. That’s 412 ships, up 58% since February, the survey added.\n\nIt’s clear that lockdowns in China have caused a bottleneck, the firm said.\n\nAcross China, at least 27 cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to latest CNN calculation on Wednesday. Beijing effectively shut down its largest district this week.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping signaled this week that China would continue with its zero tolerance approach to Covid. On Thursday, Xi told all levels of government to “resolutely adhere to the zero-Covid policy.”\n\nChina is home to seven of the world’s top ten container ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In Shanghai — the epicenter of China’s current Covid outbreak, the situation remains severe.\n\nThe number of vessels waiting at the Port of Shanghai had increased to 384 by April 25, up 27% from a month earlier, according to most recent data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPressure is also building on other Chinese ports, as vessels try to find alternative ports to berth. Ships have faced growing delays since late March outside Ningbo-Zhoushan port, the world’s third largest port, less than a hundred miles from Shanghai, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence.\n\nContainers are also piling up because of truck shortages.\n\nTrucks wait to load containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nAt the peak of the lockdown in Shanghai, containers were sitting for as many as 15 days at the port before being picked up by truckers, up from fewer than 5 days when the restrictions first took effect, Project 44 data showed. The average wait time has since come down but was still 10 days last Wednesday.\n\nZhang Wei, vice mayor of Shanghai, acknowledged last week that the city is seeing “reduced efficiency” in cargo transport and “poor logistics” since the lockdown.\n\nManufacturing and trade take a hit\n\nThe turmoil at the ports has already hit China’s factories and foreign trade, as manufacturers have to wait longer to get raw materials.\n\nIt is also harder for them to ship their products to customers. Inventories of finished goods have surged to the highest level in about a decade, as products pile up in warehouses due to weak demand and the difficulty of finding trucks to move them.\n\nCranes lift containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China.

New export orders that manufacturers received in April fell at a much faster pace than in March.\n\nThe decline in export orders showed that the chaos at some major ports, including Shanghai, have hit China’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\n\n“Worryingly, there was plenty of evidence of worsening supply pressures, with supplier delivery times collapsing, input prices surging and inventories of finished good rising to their highest since June 2012,” wrote Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, in a report.\n\n“Such supply pressures will have ramifications across supply chains globally, as already evidenced in some recent US Q1 earnings reports in the tech sector,” he added.\n\nGlobal inflation to go higher\n\nThe situation in Shanghai will push global inflation higher this year, said Daejin Lee, associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHe pointed out that last year’s inflation was driven by two factors — supply shortages of key parts owing to supply chain bottlenecks, and record high container freight rates.\n\nBoth problems continue this year, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fueled global inflation by driving up prices for energy and other key commodities.\n\n“Another lengthy delay” in seaborne supply of key parts because of China’s port congestion could increase consumer prices “much faster than previously expected,” Lee said.\n\nMaersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created “bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.”\n\nThe company’s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/economy/worker-shortage-small-business/index.html", "title": "America's small businesses are running out of workers | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pandemic forced Freed Bodyworks, a wellness center offering massage therapy, yoga, acupuncture, mental health counseling and other services, to shut down for four months. But while clients returned when it reopened in the summer of 2020, workers did not.\n\nAlmost two years later, owners Frances Reed and Jessica VonDyke were forced to shut the business’ doors.\n\n“I couldn’t hire anyone,” said Reed. “We never had trouble with our demand for services. It was 100% a supply issue for us.”\n\nFreed Bodyworks Holistic Wellness Center in Washington, DC. Courtesy Freed Bodyworks\n\nBefore the pandemic, Freed Bodyworks had 20 practitioners booking up to 550 clients a month. It reopened with a skeleton crew of eight – too few, Reed said, to bring in enough revenue to sustain the business.\n\nTwo former staffers had departed for graduate school, three had moved to areas with a lower cost of living and several had to take on caregiving roles in their families. Moreover, the shutdown of in-person instruction at massage schools dried up what had once been a dependable pipeline of emerging talent.\n\n“In the entire time period from when we reopened until closing, I managed to hire three people, and that was with full-time recruiting,” they said.\n\nReed is far from alone. Small business owners across the United States today face an acute labor shortage, which experts warn has hit a crisis level.\n\nA recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found that about half of small-business owners said in July they still can’t fill open jobs, a near-record high in the survey’s roughly five-decade history.\n\n“Hiring has never been harder for small-business owners,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for the NFIB.\n\nWhile the current labor market poses a challenge for employers of all sizes, small businesses have less ammunition in the battle for talent, lacking access to the kind of cash flow, credit and economies of scale that larger corporations enjoy. That makes it harder for them to offer things like competitive wages or sign-on bonuses.\n\n“It’s likely true that the big box stores are paying more,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.\n\nThat puts mom-and-pop businesses at a serious disadvantage. “If they’re operating on tight margins, maybe they can’t afford to raise wages to lure more workers,” Holzer said.\n\nInflation is a small-biz “double whammy”\n\nSusan Sarich founded SusieCakes in 2006 and has grown it into a 26-bakery chain, the vast majority of which are in California. But her head count has plunged from nearly 500 before the pandemic to just over 200 now – and rebuilding those ranks has become more and more difficult.\n\nWith gas prices in California still at around $5.30 per gallon, many prospective employees say they can no longer afford to commute an hour or more, Sarich said.\n\n“We increased hourly pay close to 20% [but] the cost of living is off the charts,” she said. “Some are commuting upwards of an hour and a half each way and you add on gas prices and it’s like, how does the math work?” she said.\n\nSusieCakes bakery chain, founded in 2006, has seen its head count plunge from nearly 500 before the pandemic to just over 200 workers now. Courtesy SusieCakes\n\nTo cope, her bakeries remain closed two days a week and are open shorter hours. She has cut her product offerings, including dropping customer favorites like iced sugar cookies based on a beloved family recipe.\n\n“The demand was there, but we didn’t have the people, so we had to pivot pretty quickly to a reduced labor model. For us, that meant fewer days, fewer hours a day and fewer products,” she said, adding that she is still down from her pre-pandemic revenue by about 15%.\n\nEric Groves, CEO of Alignable, an online platform for small businesses, said owners are taking it on the chin, with higher inflation both raising their costs and crimping their sales as consumers become more cautious.\n\n“We’re seeing this double whammy,” he said. “It’s harder to find people, and the costs are going up.”\n\nA recent Alignable survey found that only about a third of small businesses are making 90% or more of their pre-pandemic revenue, Groves said. That’s worse than the results of a similar survey conducted last year, when 42% said they had recovered 90% or more of their pre-pandemic business.\n\n“They do have to sometimes dial back the hours that they’re open,” Groves said. “It’s this constant pressure of lower revenue, higher costs and challenges of just trying to get to the other side of this.”\n\nWorkers still in the driver’s seat – for now\n\nThere’s a combination of factors working against small business owners as they try to add head count.\n\nThe July jobs report showed that the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%, matching the half-century low it reached in February 2020. The report also showed that the labor force participation fell slightly, to 62.1%.\n\n“Able-bodied people of the right age are just not out there looking for jobs,” said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nA number of factors are behind this, economists say: An ongoing shortage of care workers, lower immigration rates and a pervasive fear of the pandemic.\n\n“A lot depends on, do people feel confident that we’ve got Covid under control?” Dollar said.\n\nA hiring sign is seen on the window of a retail store in Washington, D.C., on August 5. Ting Shen/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nEdward Fox owns two franchises of Tradebank, a business barter service with locations in Wichita, Kansas, and Nashville. When his sole Nashville-based employee departed at the end of 2020, he spent six months searching in vain before giving up and shuttering the office. He estimates that he sacrificed $200,000 to $300,000 in lost business as a result.\n\n“We were hoping that the job market would bounce back, that we’d have a bunch of people applying… but, man, it has been a struggle,” he said.\n\nFox said he was constrained in his ability to raise pay because Covid quashed many of the barter deals his business brokered, knocking out around 75% of his business. Without someone on the ground in Nashville, it made it tough to recapture that revenue. “I just think that everybody is looking for the same labor pool, and it’s tough,” he said.\n\n“I think employees these days want more flexibility. I think managers don’t want to let go of the control they have over the employee,” he said. “I think we’ve got a new reality we’ve got to face there, too.”\n\nBig hit from small-business loss\n\nThe loss of any single small business might be a drop in the ocean for the US economy, but if enough small businesses like Reed’s ultimately fail due to the labor shortage, that situation could turn into an economic tsunami, experts warn. Small businesses account for nearly half of private sector employment and contribute more than 40% to the US gross domestic product.\n\n“It would be a shame to see them go out of business. You don’t want the retail sector getting more and more concentrated,” Holzer said.\n\nWhen vacant storefronts become a fixture on Main Streets across the nation, consumers wind up with fewer choices about where they spend their money, and workers are left with fewer places to seek employment.\n\n“Anytime you lose jobs, it reduces the overall health of the local labor market,” Holzer said. “It’s good for workers to have choice as well as consumers.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

Google's parent company Alphabet recently laid off 12,000 workers, equivalent to 12% of its workforce. Meta cut an even bigger share of its staff. Even IBM, which has been in business for 111 years, is cutting thousands of jobs.\n\nSince the start of the year, 297 tech companies laid off nearly 95,000 workers, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, a website that's been tracking tech layoffs since March 2020. If that rate continues, the industry could cut more than 900,000 jobs in 2023. That's nearly six times the total for the industry in 2022, according to the site.\n\nBut the sky isn't exactly falling in the tech industry, or at least not yet.\n\nHere's why:\n\nTech jobs were growing before the pandemic\n\nBefore the pandemic, the tech industry was steadily growing. As investments in cybersecurity, cloud computing and artificial intelligence poured into companies, their need for employees grew.\n\nIn the five years leading up to the pandemic, the tech industry added 1.3 million workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, an information-technology trade group.\n\nTracking tech layoffs:Why companies like Amazon and Meta cut jobs in 2022\n\nWho decides who gets cut?:Layoffs in a likely recession this year could be determined by software programs\n\nThe earlier hiring wasn't as widely publicized as the hiring that occurred in 2021. That resulted in a \"perception issue that there was so much more demand during the past two years compared to previously,\" said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.\n\nThe perception that tech hired an unprecedented level of workers also may have misled people to believe that recent layoffs were heftier.\n\nThe pandemic forced companies to layoff workers\n\nWhen COVID-19 swept across the country, consumers quickly tightened their purse strings, resulting in massive job losses.\n\nAnd even though demand for tech workers was strong leading up to the pandemic, like almost every industry, tech was not immune to layoffs during the crisis. In August 2020 tech unemployment peaked at 4.6% while the nation's overall unemployment rate was 8.4%.\n\n'I was too ambitious':Spotify CEO announces layoffs among 6% of employees as tech job cuts continue\n\n‘A huge windfall’:Automakers look to hire tech talent from job cuts in Silicon Valley\n\nTech goes on a hiring spree as economic conditions improve\n\nEconomic conditions improved in the fall of 2020, much faster than tech companies anticipated. Demand for electronics like computers, gaming systems and smartphones exploded as the government issued stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits.\n\nBut to get products to consumers, tech companies had to navigate broken supply chains and transform themselves into more e-commerce-driven businesses.\n\nTo succeed and seize the opportunity to profit from unprecedented demand, tech companies needed more manpower and they needed it immediately, said Herbert.\n\nTo meet the unprecedented demand tech went on a hiring spree.\n\nWhy are there tech layoffs? Interest rates went up, eating into tech profits\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March 2022 to get inflation under control, tech companies felt the pain because they're more reliant on outside funding than other industries. When interest rates increase, it’s more expensive for them to borrow money.\n\nMeanwhile, many consumers stopped buying electronics after they depleted their stimulus money. Tech stocks got crushed in the months after the Fed's March rate hike.\n\nThe companies that went on hiring sprees did a 180 degree turn and began cutting. Apple, though, which hired the least number of new workers among the other four big-tech companies, has avoided layoffs so far.\n\nWhile the layoffs are alarming, they represent a relatively small share of tech companies' workforces in 2022. And even with the layoffs, all five big-tech companies have bigger workforces now than before the pandemic.\n\nLaid-off tech workers are finding new jobs\n\nEven though tech layoffs are growing, the tech unemployment rate is dropping. In January the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis.\n\nThat indicates that \"many of the laid-off workers were quickly reabsorbed back into the tech workforce,\" said Herbert.\n\nThe hiring is most likely coming from small and mid-size companies that are still facing worker shortages because they couldn't previously compete with the salaries and perks traditional Silicon Valley tech companies used to lure in new talent, he added.\n\nRelative to the entire industry, big tech accounts for a relatively small share of the entire tech workforce. Small and mid-size companies make up the bulk of the industry. They, for the most part, are doing OK for now.\n\nBut the future is a big question mark.\n\n\"At some point, we probably should prepare to see some of these (tech) layoffs show up in the numbers,\" Herbert said.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald is a personal finance and markets correspondent for USA TODAY.

Their participation rate rebounded somewhat from 2017 to 2019 as unemployment fell and wages increased in a vibrant labor market. But it slid during the health crisis and has yet to fully recover despite record job growth over the past two years.\n\nSlower wage growth?:Waiting on a raise? It may be smaller than you hoped. New survey indicates US wage growth will slow\n\nFee fatigue:Subscription fatigue: More companies are charging monthly fees. How much can consumers take?\n\nWhat is the labor force participation rate for 25 to 54?\n\nIn January, the share of 25- to 54-year-old men working or job-hunting was at 88.5%, below the pre-pandemic mark of 89.2%. By contrast, the participation rate for women in that age group had climbed to 76.9%, effectively back to its pre-pandemic level of 77%.\n\nIf the participation rate for prime-age men was at its 1990 level, there would be an additional 2.7 million of them in the workforce, estimates economist Justin Begley of Moody’s Analytics.\n\nAnd that could mean a big shot in the arm for the economy.\n\nBehind the lettuce shortage:Dole cyberattack may be the cause of prepackaged lettuce shortage\n\nHow does men leaving the workforce contribute to Fed increasing interest rates?\n\nBoosting the nation’s supply of workers could go a long way toward easing inflation and persuading the Federal Reserve to pause its aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said goods inflation is moderating, but officials are focused on slowing price increases in service industries, like health and education, which are tied to rising labor costs.\n\nThe Fed’s rate increases are intended to raise business borrowing costs, thus curtailing hiring and investment, but most economists believe they’ll tip the nation into a recession this year.\n\nBy contrast, expanding the pool of workers would be another way to bring the labor market into better balance and slow pay increases without sharply reducing job openings or increasing layoffs.\n\n“The best way to achieve a loosening in the labor market would be to increase labor supply,” Begley and Moody’s economist Matt Colyar wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMoonlighting:Could you handle more than one full-time job? 37% of workers do\n\nWhy did so many US men stop working?\n\nEconomists have long put much of the blame on the offshoring of manufacturing jobs to China, a trend that picked up steam in the early 2000s after China joined the World Trade Organization, Begley and Colyar note.\n\nA 2021 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond also cites a rise in male substance abuse and even heavy video game use.\n\nAnother study several months ago by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston cites a less obvious reason: Non-college-educated men have left the labor force in greater numbers as the shortfall in their wages compared with those of college-educated men has increased, the study says.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2019, non-college-educated men’s median weekly earnings fell 17% after adjusting for inflation, while pay for their college-educated counterparts increased by 20%.\n\n“This finding suggests that deteriorating social status is a plausible key factor,” the Boston Fed paper concluded.\n\nIn other words, the lower self-esteem associated with a lower social status has caused some men to simply drop out rather than cope with the stress.\n\nIt’s unclear how they’re generating income, but some may be relying on a spouse’s earnings or doing occasional work that’s not recorded by Labor Department surveys.\n\nOther men leave the labor force to go back to school and bolster their skill set, while still others are hampered by a disability, the paper said.\n\nGood news on housing costs:Mortgage insurance costs dropping for some new homebuyers. Here's how much you could save.\n\nWhy are wages increasing?\n\nOver the past couple of years, however, the tide has turned somewhat. Lower-wage workers have benefited from larger pay increases than higher-wage employees – narrowing the gap between the two groups – as industries such as restaurants, hotels and retail struggle to find employees.\n\nWorkers with a high school education or less reported annual wage growth of 6.7% in January, compared with a gain of 5.9% for those with a bachelor’s degree, according to Begley and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nHigher pay should be prodding at least some less-educated, lower-wage workers to return to the labor force.\n\n“The opportunity cost of not working grows as wages increase,” Begley says.\n\nThough that has happened to some extent, the gains have not been significant so far, he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2022/04/10/restaurant-workers-employment-new-careers/7252393001/", "title": "Why Detroit food service workers are leaving the hospitality industry", "text": "What started as The Great Resignation soon became The Great Realization. Then, The Great Reshuffle. The Great Renegotiation. The Great Upgrade. The Great Rethink.\n\nThe terms coined to explain the mass exodus of workers who quit their jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic are aplenty, but the sentiments are the same: American workers are retooling their career standards.\n\nAnd as Michigan restaurant workers, in particular, seek out opportunities for higher wages, flexible scheduling and job security, unexpected industries are luring them away from hospitality.\n\nIn search of greener pastures, servers are turning to entrepreneurship, bartenders to engineering and food service veterans are answering the ever-present call to the auto industry.\n\nRelated:GM to fill 400 software jobs in defiance of the Great Resignation\n\nRelated:Economy, job growth set to slow but remain strong in 2022 as Great Resignation rolls on\n\nWhen reality sets in\n\nThere are obvious draws of working in the food service industry, and they come in the form of cotton-linen blends of currency inked in green. On a good night at a bar or restaurant, they’re a front-of-house worker’s greatest reward for attending to needy diners and parched bargoers.\n\n“You have your $500 nights upwards to say, New Year’s Eve when you can be Scrooge McDuck, when you get out of work and jump into a pile of money,” said Nick Silas, a longtime bartender and server. “And that’s weird to say as someone who doesn’t have a bachelor’s degree or a trained skill set to make upward of $70 an hour.”\n\nSilas nearly completed his degree, first in hospitality management and later in elementary education, but eventually, as is the case for many paying for their own education, he ran low on funds. Silas turned to bartending and developed an affinity for the social nature of the job.\n\n“Being able to give the guest the experience they want,” he said, “I got enjoyment out of that.”\n\nBut at the start of the pandemic, reality set in. A manager at a popular Brush Park bar, Silas found himself among the 76% of bar and restaurant employees who were laid off. Time away from the bustling bar scene cleared space for introspection.\n\n“I came to this contemplation that I didn't have a skill set when COVID hit. I didn't have something to fall back on that was recession-proof,” he said.\n\nThe revelation kicked up a dust of hopelessness in its trail.\n\nThree months into the layoff, Silas began to pursue a dormant interest in software engineering that his work schedule would otherwise not permit. Now, with time on his hands, he enrolled in a yearlong online coding boot camp through Flatiron School. When his employers called him back to the restaurant, he resigned and dedicated himself to the course full-time.\n\nSince earning his certificate, Silas has returned to the food service industry, but only to earn a living while he applies for jobs in web development.\n\n“Working in food service is brutal, mentally and physically,” Silas said. “It's fun, but it can be stressful. You’ll notice you don't see too many bartenders over the age of 45 — you do have a shelf life in the industry.”\n\n'The world as we know it is different'\n\nIn February alone, 4.4 million Americans quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s nearly 1 million more than the number who left their jobs in February 2021. And the bureau's most recent state-level numbers show 143,000 Michiganders resigned their positions in January, landing the state among the top 10 in quit levels across the country.\n\nTerms like “realization” and “rethink” encapsulate the mindsets that are driving the workforce exodus. Employees are reevaluating the role that work plays in their lives and making adjustments accordingly.\n\n“The Great Upgrade is probably the most appropriate term,” said Michigan Works! Association CEO Ryan Hundt. “When we talk about The Great Resignation, the perception is that it’s largely white-collar workers that are leaving their jobs to either seek other opportunities or exit the labor force as a whole. But as wages are increasing in almost all sectors of the economy, we're seeing lower-wage workers seeking out opportunities where they can receive better pay, better benefits, better work-life balance.”\n\nWhere then, amid a collective philosophical reckoning, do food service workers turn for better opportunity?\n\nThe perils of the hospitality industry are well-documented, particularly for bar and restaurant workers. Low wages and high demands; toxic kitchen cultures and pay disparities; inflexible scheduling and a lack of health care for hourly workers are just a few of the historic impediments to their quality of life. The global health crisis that started in 2020 held a magnifying glass to these issues, and added more challenges for good measure.\n\nAt the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, three of every four restaurant workers were unemployed while others, considered essential workers, were tasked with serving takeout meals to maskless customers even as case numbers climbed.\n\nDine-in service eventually returned, but the damage was done. During the surge of the omicron variant in January, a COVID-19 Restaurant Impact Survey by the National Restaurant Association showed that 86% of eateries saw diminished demand for indoor dining. The decline in customer traffic, in turn, left front-of-house workers with lower tip wages, and today, a universal staff shortage is burdening shrinking teams with greater responsibilities.\n\n“The world as we know it is different, and it’s going to remain different behind the global pandemic,” said Chris White, director of ROC United Michigan, a nonprofit relief organization for restaurant workers. “It’s made us all look at job protection safety and whether your wages are worth what you have to endure in the industry.”\n\nIf the number of restaurant workers fleeing the hospitality industry is any indication, the wages are not worth the workload. According to Hundt, the restaurant industry was impacted more significantly than any other industry — not just in Michigan, but nationwide. And accommodation and food service workers are quitting at a higher rate than staffers in any other industry.\n\nBars and restaurants have been slow to adopt the tenets that draw and retain employees — namely, fair wages, benefit packages and scheduling that accommodates the traditional needs of working parents. As position vacancies skyrocket in various industries, folks are loosening the tether to an industry that no longer serves them, or worse, one that never did.\n\n“When there are 11 million open jobs across the country,\" said Mark Gaffney, a mayoral appointee to the Detroit Workforce Board, \"you know that your chances of finding a better job is not unreasonable.”\n\nSo as their peers in other industries are resigning to seek better opportunities in similar roles at new companies, many food industry workers are abandoning the hospitality industry altogether, seeking healthier, happier, more sustainable opportunities in entirely new fields. Thus, perhaps, defining a new term in the pandemic lexicon: The Great Restart.\n\nRestarting and retooling\n\nGaffney conducted a study on the forces driving resignations in metro Detroit and found that nearly 40% of individuals opted against returning to work for COVID-19- or family-related reasons. Many among them were women.\n\n“You've seen this enormous uptick in the number of women who are participating in The Great Resignation because in America, child care still falls more often on the female spouse,” he said.\n\nGaffney also found that one of the most common frustrations with the food service industry among its workers is inflexible scheduling.\n\n“I began to see, as we were looking at the statistics for the last two years, that it was not only about pay,\" Gaffney said. \"A high reason that people go through this stuff is because of the scheduling.”\n\nShana Sharrar-Smith, of South Lyon, falls into both categories.\n\nRecently divorced — Sharrar-Smith found herself among the bartenders and waitstaff who top the list of occupations with the highest divorce rates — she sought a job opportunity that would offer stability for herself and her two young children.\n\nRelated:Wayne County women and children suffer amid months-long backlog of divorce cases\n\n“I needed something with consistency now that I was on my own with my kids,” she said.\n\nOffered the opportunity to take on a management role at the jazz club where she worked just before COVID-19 struck, she mulled over whether the pay increase would be worth the long hours.\n\n“I needed a job that would bring more to the table, but when you're a manager, you're there from open to close every night for so many nights a week,” she said. “I wanted to have time where I could make dinner once in a while for my kids or put them to bed.”\n\nUltimately, her children were the priority.\n\nSharrar-Smith embarked on a road much traveled by metro Detroit natives. She landed a role with Ford Motor Co., building Broncos and Rangers at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne.\n\n“It’s a completely different career than I was used to, but it’s a job that brings consistency and insurance and money to the table,” she said.\n\nComing from a long line of auto industry workers — “my Grandma used to put the fabric on vehicle seats; my uncles worked, and still work, for Ford; I’ve got cousins that worked for Chrysler” — Sharrar-Smith considered herself among the auto-kid rebellion, the descendants of line workers who vowed to never end up at the plant.\n\n“I never thought I'd end up liking the auto industry as much as I do,” she said. “But I moved out and got a promotion, and now I work nights and 12-hour shifts and get overtime. I love my job.\"\n\n'That gut feeling'\n\nFor more than 15 years, Tony Ruacho bounced between dive bars, jazz clubs and tourist bars — not to mention side gigs bartending and serving at weddings and various special events. Ruacho might have considered staying within the bar and restaurant industry had his employer provided health care. Instead, the only employer he could depend on to have his best interest at heart was himself.\n\n“If I would’ve been given some sort of benefits working at a place long enough that you get the kicker out of it at the end of your life, I might have considered staying,” he said. “But no — you’re a dispensable employee.”\n\nThe pandemic had a way of revealing this lack of investment in restaurant workers’ well-being for Ruacho. This, coupled with a general disillusionment toward the nature of the business — Ruacho grew to miss the days when clouds of cigarette smoke billowed throughout the bar and soon, politically incorrect jokes began to lose their charm — Ruacho had outgrown the job.\n\n“It was a changing style of what the bar used to be back in the day when it was cool to be a bartender,” he said.\n\nWhen he was laid off by all three of his employers, he was uncharacteristically relieved.\n\n“At a certain point, I felt better knowing that I could get away without feeling guilty about having to quit my job,” he said. “I finally realized that I could work for myself.”\n\nRuacho invested in himself in a way his former employers hadn’t. He embarked on an entirely new entrepreneurial career in an entirely new city: Marcellus, Michigan, a quaint village south of Kalamazoo.\n\nRuacho and his wife, Sarah Ayers, purchased an old hardware store in Marcellus, the small west Michigan town where Ayers grew up, and converted it into an art gallery. Today, Patch and Remington is clad in works by local artists and soon, the duo will expand the industrial space into a job-force training center that provides the town's blue-collar workers with technological resources.\n\n“As you get older, when you have that gut feeling, you go with it,” Ruacho said. The minute the door of this space opened, I knew I was out of the bar biz.”\n\nTapping into passions\n\nIf Lacey Jones were to have told her parents that she was planning to pursue a career in hairstyling prior to 2020, she might not have been met with the same warm support she received when she enrolled into cosmetology school last April.\n\n“A lot of things shifted during the pandemic,” she said.\n\nJones, who’d become a restaurant manager before the age of 21, counters the trope that restaurant workers don’t want to return to work. In fact, not having the option to work while laid off from her job at a Detroit restaurant inspired Jones to tap into her passions and skill sets.\n\n“Having a skill of your own is so important,” she said. “No one can take that away from you.”\n\nJones reflected on her childhood ambitions and sought a role that would drive her even on her most tiresome days. “It made me think about what I could do that would make me happy and that I could make money doing at the same time. For me, it was hair.”\n\nAs a child, Jones would style her mother’s hair and continued experimenting on her own into adulthood. She studied curl patterns and learned techniques for styling natural textures. Once she pinpointed her passion, she enrolled in a cosmetology school in Royal Oak and started on the path to a new career in hairstyling.\n\n“As a server, you can make as much money as you can with your regulars, but if the restaurant closes, you can't take those people into the next space,” she said. “Being in the salon, I can build my clientele and if the salon closes, my skills are still valued because it's my service that I’m providing.\"\n\nSoon after she started school, Jones learned she was pregnant and would welcome a daughter before completing the program.\n\n“Having a daughter, I wanted her to see that it's possible to follow your dreams,” she said. “When she’s older, I want to be able to tell her, ‘This is what I did and look at me now.’ ”\n\nJones is on track to complete her program in August and has already landed a role as a stylist at Hudson Styling Co., a new Corktown hair salon.\n\nAs she contemplates a long-term vision for her career in hairstyling. Jones weighs the advantages of ownership. “I realized that nothing was going to be promising unless it was something that I could own,” she said. \"It's such a powerful thing to own a business in every community, but for the Black community, it's even more of a reward to have a stamp on the city. To be able to turn the key and look at all the work that you put in that got you here — I'm not there yet, but that would be the best reward.”\n\nMore:Young workers are changing the dynamics of Michigan's labor market\n\nReimagining hospitality\n\nWhile American economists continue to hone the linguistics of the flight of the labor force, the Australian company The CEO Institute refers to a term of the era for the employer. In a December article, The CEO Institute speaker Marie-Claire Ross wrote:\n\n“Perceiving this time as The Great Reimagination provides you and your leadership team with a powerful lens to reengineer a workplace that is fairer, more compassionate, energetic and creative. A place where employees love their job and are healthy and productive. A workplace designed for the twenty-first century not the twentieth. And it starts with asking yourself the questions: What do we need to do to optimise our culture, so that people want to stay because they are thriving?”\n\nDiverting attention to the systemic issues that plague the bar and restaurant industry lends an opportunity to devise strategies for correction.\n\n“If hospitality and restaurant industries are serious about retaining talent within their companies, they're going to have to continue to offer resources, whether it's benefits, mental health resources, better work-life balance, taking a look at their wage structures or scheduling time off,” said Hundt of Michigan Works! “The competitiveness for talent is only just beginning and if any industry were serious about remaining competitive going forward, they'll have to keep on pursuing those strategies going forward.”\n\nAccording to White, it’s up to organizations like ROC United Michigan to push businesses in the right direction through initiatives such as the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights, a policy framework designed to address the challenges among food service workers.\n\n“One in five jobs, according to the Department of Labor, comes from the restaurant industry and it’s going to be a growing industry,” White said. “We’re in a position now where we can do this right and make it where the industry grows through pragmatic and ethical approaches to doing business.”\n\nThoughtful systematic adjustments, White said, could lead to worker and customer retention, customer satisfaction and customer growth — results, which are perhaps far more valuable than a dictionary of terms to define the moment.\n\nContact Lyndsay C.

The survey also found that 46% of companies are dropping or reducing signing bonuses and 44% are rescinding offers.\n\nDespite these signs, Ohio's unemployment rate hovered around an all-time low of 3.9% in July, a notch above the rate of 3.8% in 2001, the lowest rate since the start of the data in 1976.\n\nOther signs also show that employment remains strong. Nationally, the economy added more than 528,000 jobs in July, hardly an indicator of an economy in trouble, and job openings rose in July after three months of declines. In Ohio, a state service that aggregates help-wanted ads shows demand for workers continues to be strong.\n\n\"We're still hearing a ton about a shortage of employees,\" said Steve Stivers, president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.\n\nUnemployment:Ohio unemployment remains near all-time low as recession worries climb\n\nLayoffs:Victoria's Secret & Co. to cut 160 management jobs\n\n\"We are not seeing mass layoffs,\" he added. \"We are seeing individual companies doing things.\"\n\nThe health technology company Olive, for example, attributed its layoffs of 450 workers in July to an overly aggressive expansion plan. Root, the Columbus auto insurance startup, blamed the pandemic for spiraling costs that led it lay off 330 workers. And Victoria's Secret cut 160 management jobs at its corporate offices in July as part of a corporate reorganization.\n\nIt makes sense that some companies are starting to pull back on hiring or are letting workers go, given rising interest rates, inflation and wage costs, said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.\n\n\"You've got to cut somewhere,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless, Ayers added, \"There are still so many job openings out there. They aren't staying unemployed for very long.\"\n\nIs the US economy headed for a recession in 2022?\n\nIn addition to big layoffs, several other indicators suggest the economy is slowing if not in a recession.\n\nAvailable homes in Columbus to buyers are up 16% from a year ago to the highest level in three years. Inflation is surging, running at levels not seen since the 1980s, and gasoline prices hit record highs this summer before easing recently.\n\nHousing market:Columbus home shoppers see more choices, better prices\n\nConsumers, flush with cash early in the pandemic from federal stimulus programs and from bypassing travel and entertainment, have cut back on spending as costs have soared.\n\nThe Columbus-based retailer Bath & Body Works, for example, said in July that it noticed a decline in traffic in its stores compared with earlier in the year.\n\n\"Our data indicates that customers, particularly lower-income customers, have become more cost conscious and are limiting purchases and/or seeking out lower-priced sale merchandise as they are being impacted by the overall inflationary environment,\" the retailer said in July.\n\nWhere are the jobs?\n\nStill, help-wanted ads in Ohio are about double from where they were two years ago.\n\nOhioMeansJobs.com, the state's jobs website, listed 335,500 openings for the most-recent period, down 6,715 ads from the month before, but up 71,132 ads from the same period in 2021.\n\nRegistered nurses are the most in-demand statewide followed by truck drivers, retail sales supervisors and software developers, according to the state data.\n\nIn central Ohio, there were 78,802 job openings, led by demand for software developers. There were 111,047 openings for 18 counties in northeast Ohio and 54,423 openings in southwest Ohio, including Cincinnati.\n\nIn central Ohio, there were 78,802 openings, led by demand for software developers.

But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.”\n\nWhile Ayers doesn't believe the economy is in a recession now, he thinks there could be one in 2023 as the Fed continues to raise interest rates to choke inflation.\n\nHe expects the state's unemployment rate to remain close to historic lows before starting to climb in six to nine months as layoffs pick up steam. But he also expects a recession to be more modest than the last two, in the early days of the pandemic and the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009.\n\nThe next one likely will be more modest, he said.\n\n\"Many households are still in pretty good shape,\" Ayers said. \"Business balance sheets are in pretty good shape as well.

It’s a shame the affairs of this nation have become so polarized and the rhetoric so vile that a citizen would express that.\n\n“With the President having so many strong opinions and prejudices,” McCourty explained, “I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.”\n\nBlount echoed McCourty’s sentiment about not feeling welcomed, while Bennett — the first Patriot to make his intentions known about skipping the White House — urged people to follow him on Twitter and check out his tweets if they need more of an understanding of his view.\n\nHow fitting, given all the tweets that have come from Trump.\n\n“It is what it is,” Bennett told reporters after Super Bowl LI. “People know how I feel about it.”\n\nLong, meanwhile, didn’t mention Trump by name. But he tweeted that his decision had absolutely nothing to do with an open letter published to him that urged that he join African-Americans by skipping the White House.\n\nNo, Long, a ninth-year vet, doesn’t need suggestions from any of us. When protests by African-American players ramped up early in the season after Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, Long offered a response that was largely missing — that he felt it was important for white players to speak out against societal injustice, too.\n\nThat he won’t go to the White House underscores that sentiment.\n\nBrady, meanwhile, refused to get political during Super Bowl week, telling me, “I have a right to stay out of it,” even though he once displayed a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker — which has been interpreted by many as a statement in itself.\n\nThe first quarterback to win five Super Bowls may not owe the world an explanation about his political leanings. But in this climate, you’d think that Brady — who in the past has talked about his interest in following politics — would want to set the record straight about some of views.\n\nBrady’s had a friendship with Trump over many years. So has Kraft, who points to Trump’s support during an emotional crisis after his wife Myra died in 2011 as a foundation for their bond.\n\nYet given the issues and the actions by Trump that have sparked protests and various forms of resistance, Kraft, by not distancing himself from the politics, could have his position interpreted as tacit approval.\n\nSo Brady has a big opportunity in front of him, too — even if he visits the White House this time.\n\nIn the meantime, the Patriot Way rolls on as the records keep falling.\n\nPHOTOS: TOM BRADY THROUGH THE YEARS", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/braves/2022/09/26/braves-visit-white-house-president-biden-celebrate-2021-title/8121744001/", "title": "Braves visit White House, President Biden to celebrate 2021 title", "text": "Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden said Monday that the Atlanta Braves will be “forever known as the upset kings of October” for their improbable 2021 World Series win, as he welcomed the team to the White House for a victory celebration.\n\nBiden called the series an “unstoppable, joyful run.” The team got its White House victory visit in with a little more than a week left before the 2022 regular season wraps up and playoffs begin again. The Braves are just two wins behind first place in the National League East. Chief Executive Officer Terry McGuirk said he hoped they’d be back to the White House again soon.\n\nIn August 2021, the Braves were a mess, playing barely at .500. But then they started winning. And they kept doing it, clinching the World Series in six games over the Houston Astros.\n\nBiden called their come-from-behind win one of “history’s greatest turnarounds.”\n\n“This team has literally been part of American history for over 150 years,” said Biden. “But none of it came easy … people counting you out. Heck, I know something about being counted out.”\n\nFollow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules\n\nPlayers lined up on risers behind Biden, grinning and waving to the crowd, but the player most discussed was one who hasn’t been on the team in nearly 50 years and who died last year: Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.\n\nHammerin’ Hank was the homerun king for 33 years, dethroning Babe Ruth with a high flier to centerfield on April 8, 1974. He was one of the most famous players for Atlanta and in baseball history, a vocal and clear-eyed chronicler of the many hardships thrown his way – from the poverty and segregation of his Alabama youth to the racist threats he faced during his pursuit of one of America’s most hallowed records. He died in January at age 86.\n\n“This is team is defined by the courage of Hank Aaron,” Biden said.\n\nMcGuirk said Aaron, who held front office positions with the team and was one of Major League Baseball’s few Black executives, was watching over them.\n\n“He’d have been there every step of the way with us if he was here,” McGuirk added.\n\nThe president often honors major league and some college sports champions with a White House ceremony, typically a nonpartisan affair in which the commander in chief pays tribute to the champs’ prowess, poses for photos and comes away with a team jersey.\n\nThose visits were highly charged in the previous administration. Many athletes took issue with President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric on policing, immigration and more. Trump, for his part, didn’t take kindly to criticism from athletes or their on-field expressions of political opinion.\n\nUnder Biden, the tradition appears to be back. He’s hosted the NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks and Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the White House. Biden on Monday joked about first lady Jill Biden’s Philadelphia allegiances.\n\n“Like every Philly fan, she’s convinced she knows more about everything in sports than anybody else,” he said. He added that he couldn’t be too nice to the Atlanta team because it had just beaten the Phillies the previous night in extra innings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/02/20/how-often-have-athletes-snubbed-the-white-house/98145974/", "title": "How often have athletes snubbed the White House?", "text": "AP\n\nThe routine is familiar. The president makes a few bad jokes. The championship-winning team presents the leader of the free world with a personalized jersey. Everyone smiles for the cameras.\n\nNothing political about that, right?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nIn a divided nation, everything is political.\n\nWhile presidents have been snubbed before, six players from the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots took it to another level by preemptively turning down an expected invitation from President Trump.\n\nRest assured, they won't be the last to mix sports and politics.\n\n\"The balance of power in professional sports now rests more with the performers than the owners,\" said Stephen Mosher, a professor of sports management and media at Ithaca College. \"Without a labor force, (Patriots owner) Robert Kraft has nothing but an empty stadium. He has to let his employees make these political statements if he wants to win. He has to. There's too many different political views held by players in the National Football League.\n\n\"Actually,\" Mosher added, \"I think it's quite refreshing.\"\n\nThe Patriots were part of the political discourse even before they dramatically rallied from 25 points down to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the first Super Bowl to go to overtime.\n\nKraft is a friend of the 45th president, and quarterback Tom Brady drew plenty of scrutiny when one of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" caps was spotted in his locker at the start of the contentious presidential campaign.\n\nThen, with the Patriots still in the midst of their Super Bowl celebration, tight end Martellus Bennett made it clear he had no intention of visiting Trump's White House.\n\nFive teammates — defensive back Devin McCourty, running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long, linebacker Dont'a Hightower and defensive tackle Alan Branch — quickly followed suit. Most pinned their decision on political differences with the Republican administration.\n\nSignificant, to be sure.\n\nBut nothing new.\n\nSNUBBING THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nSince the tradition of inviting sports champions to the nation's most famous home really began to take off under President Reagan, some two dozen athletes have turned down the opportunity.\n\nThat list includes Brady, who didn't attend a 2015 celebration because of what the quarterback insisted was a \"family commitment\" but others speculated was because of some unflattering comments a spokesman for President Obama made about the Deflategate scandal.\n\nFor some, a trip to the White House was no big deal.\n\nLarry Bird shrugged off an invitation from Reagan after the Boston Celtics won an NBA title, crabbily explaining, \"If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me.\" After winning one of his six championships, Michael Jordan said he preferred to spend time with his family rather than hang with President George H.W. Bush. Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison turned down not one, but two chances to visit the White House, pointing out — quite correctly — that he wouldn't have gotten either of those invitations if his team had lost the Super Bowl.\n\nOthers cited political differences with those in power in declining.\n\nBoston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas declined to join the 2011 Stanley Cup champions on their White House visit, writing on social media that the government \"has grown out of control, threatening the Rights, Liberties, and Property of the People.\"\n\nBaltimore Ravens center Matt Birk passed on a chance to meet with Obama because of the president's support of Planned Parenthood. Golfer Tom Lehman was even more outspoken when rebuffing a president, calling Bill Clinton \"a draft-dodging baby killer.\"\n\nHOW IT ALL STARTED\n\nIn 1865, not long after the end of the Civil War and before professional baseball was even a thing, President Andrew Johnson met with a pair of amateur teams, the Washington Nationals and Brooklyn Atlantics, according to the White House Historical Association. Given the tumultuous term he would serve after inheriting the office from Abraham Lincoln, Johnson probably figured he could use all the positive publicity he could get.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge invited the hometown Senators for a visit after their dramatic seven-game victory in the 1924 World Series, which proved to be a prudent move. Washington may be first in war and first in peace, but it's still stuck on that one Series title.\n\nMore teams would visit the White House in the years to come, but Mosher points to Richard Nixon as the first president who really pushed for a connection to athletes of all stripes, with some speculating that it was a way to make up for his failed football dreams. Most notably, he began the practice of placing congratulatory phone calls right to the locker room while teams were right in the midst of their championship celebrations.\n\nReagan, who knew how to work the camera far better than Nixon, stepped up the game by using the White House as a backdrop for well-choreographed photo ops with champions from a wide range of sports. While these appearances were passed off as nothing more than a chance to dole out some well-deserved kudos while escaping the divisive issues of the day, the Gipper surely knew they had everything to do with politics.\n\n\"Basking in the reflective glory\" of a championship team, as Mosher puts it, never hurts when election time rolls around. \"They keep telling us over and over again that sports and politics don't mix,\" he said. \"But that's simply not the case.\"\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nColin Kaepernick's season-long protest against police brutality and abuses in the justice system seems to have sparked a new activism among professional athletes.\n\nThe quarterback's simple act of kneeling during the national anthem \"is very different than what I've studied in the past,\" Mosher said. \"He did it so politely, with so much respect. He wasn't calling attention to himself. The story only became a story when people noticed it. That stood in stark contrast to the ranting and raving that the political campaign was putting in front of the American public.\"\n\nIn Week 1 of the NFL season, Bennett raised his fist in a show of support.\n\nNow that the season is over, he's plunging into another fiery issue.\n\nGiven the divided state of the nation, more athletes are sure to follow.\n\nNo matter who's in the White House.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nMahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns.

As long as Mahomes is under center, this will be the standard. He won his second Super Bowl MVP days after he won his second league MVP.\n\nMahomes had his right ankle injury reaggravated late in the second quarter when Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards fell on it as he dragged him to the turf. Ho hum. All Mahomes did after the injury was complete 13 of 14 passes for 93 yards and a pair of scores. As if that wasn't enough, with 2:55 left to play in a tie game, he outran the Eagles defense on a 26-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal.\n\nRead Lorenzo Reyes' full analysis of Super Bowl 57's winners and losers here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles had a 10-point lead as Rihanna took center stage at halftime.

The playing conditions were less than pretty.\n\nPlayers from both the Eagles and Chiefs struggled to get traction on the natural grass and slipped many times. At least half a dozen Eagles players switched cleats during the first half in an attempt to get a better grip, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, who changed from Jordan 11 cleats to Jordan 1 cleats.\n\nEagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, who said he's \"not a grass expert,\" described the conditions as \"pretty slippery,\" similar to \"playing on a water park.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was one of the highest-scoring Super Bowl games ever played. It was a thrilling showdown that featured numerous records either broken (longest punt return) or tied (most points scored by a player, Jalen Hurts with 20).\n\nHere is a look at the highest-scoring Super Bowls.\n\nTravis Kelce was the winner of the unofficial \"Kelce Bowl,\" as his Kansas City Chiefs defeated his brother Jason's Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57.\n\nBut as the Chiefs celebrated their victory and Travis Kelce gave a memorable postgame interview alongside Patrick Mahomes, he made sure to see his brother following the game, as the Kelce brothers shared an embrace and briefly spoke as the confetti fell down on State Farm Stadium.\n\nJason Kelce can be heard congratulating Travis, even cracking a smile and telling him to \"go celebrate.\" Before they part, both Kelce's told each other \"I love you.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Super Bowl, like every other NFL game, has two halves. The Philadelphia Eagles only showed up for one of them.\n\nAfter pushing the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink and hobbling Patrick Mahomes, the Eagles imploded in the second half. They were outscored, outgained, outdisciplined – outhustled – and, as a result, they're out a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, given the final score was 38-35 and it took the Chiefs until the closing seconds to seal the victory. But when you have a 10-point lead, all the momentum and Mahomes barely able to run off the field at halftime, that's as close to a gimme as it gets in the NFL's biggest game.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nThe Blackest, most woke Super Bowl ever — can’t believe I wrote that since this is the Republican NFL, but here we are — started by again featuring the Black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” this time performed by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThen Rihanna performed at halftime. Despite once saying she wouldn’t perform in the Super Bowl halftime show because of the way the NFL treated Colin Kaepernick and protesting players, she was back, and make no mistake, Rihanna is one of the Blackest, proudest performers of our time.\n\nBut wait, it gets Blacker.\n\nSinger Babyface, a generational rhythm and blues singer, sang “America the Beautiful” before the game. He’s produced dozens of R&B hits and won 12 Grammy Awards. At this point we had the Black national anthem, Rihanna performing and two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time ever.

He found A.J Brown on the next third down for another first. Brown and Hurts connected again for 11 yards and another first.\n\nGiven plenty of time, Hurts found DeVonta Smith streaking down the left sideline on a blown coverage. Smith could not keep his balance and remain in bounds and went out at the 2-yard line, but not before picking up 45 yards. Hurts scored on the next play via a – you guessed it – quarterback sneak.\n\nHurts then tied the game on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt on a designed run to the left, breaking tackles and persevering over the goal line to even it at 35 with 5:15 left in the game.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nKansas City continues second-half domination\n\nKadarius Toney, Super Bowl MVP?\n\nToney had two of the biggest plays for the Chiefs during the fourth quarter, his latest was a 65-yard punt return - the longest in Super Bowl history - went to Philadelphia 5-yard line with 10:11 left in the game.\n\nThree plays later the Chiefs added to their fourth-quarter lead as Patrick Mahomes found receiver Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Chiefs took a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nToney, acquired by the Chiefs during the season, is turning out to be a pivotal move that paid off in Kansas City’s favor during the biggest game of the season. His earlier 5-yard touchdown put the Chiefs ahead in the fourth quarter.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChiefs take first lead in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Chiefs waiting until the fourth quarter to finally go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found receiver Kadarius Toney for a walk-in 5-yard touchdown, and kicker Harrison Butker made the extra point to put Kansas City ahead 28-27 with 12:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nToney went in motion toward the middle of the field, but turned quickly back to the right sidelinefor a wide-open touchdown.\n\nDuring the drive, running back Isiah Pacheco (with runs of 9 and 11 yards) and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster (with four catches for 38 yards) were instrumental for Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nReplay decision helps Eagles add to lead on Chiefs\n\nJalen Hurts could not have thrown a better ball. On third-and-14 from the Kansas City 47, Hurts dropped back on the team’s first drive of the half with a three-point lead. He found tight end Dallas Goedert near the sideline between two defenders past the sticks for what appeared to be yet another third down conversion.\n\nAlthough Goedert bobbled the ball, he regained possession in time to land both feet in bounds and the call was upheld. The challenge cost Andy Reid and the Chiefs their first timeout of the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia moved the ball inside the red zone after the play but had to settle for a field goal to make it 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHurt ankle, no problem for Patrick Mahomes\n\nAfter injuring his ankle on his final play of the second quarter, Mahomes started the second half, and even ran for a 14-yard gain inside the 5-yard line on the first drive of the third quarter.\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs on a touchdown drive to start the second half, which included a low pass to tight end Travis Kelce that kept their drive alive.\n\nChiefs running back Isiah Pacheco scored on a 1-yard run to help the Chiefs trim their deficit. The Eagles are holding onto a 24-21 lead after the first possession in the second half.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nRihanna shines bright in Super Bowl halftime show\n\nRihanna has already evolved into an immensely successful singer, a business mogul with a net worth of more than $1 billion and, as of last year, a mom.\n\nOn Sunday, the multihyphenate added another accomplishment to the checklist: Super Bowl halftime headliner.\n\nTaking the State Farm Stadium stage in Glendale, Arizona, with her most visible outing in years, Rihanna stormed through a vibrant production that spotlighted her flexible R&B grooves coupled with infectious pop hooks. And, of course, her distinctive fashion style.\n\nALL OF THE LIGHTS:Rihanna stuns in spectacular Super Bowl performance\n\n- Melissa Ruggieri\n\nSuper Bowl halftime stats: Patrick Mahomes held to 89 yards passing\n\nOnly once has a team lost the Super Bowl after leading by double-digits at halftime: the Atlanta Falcons before the New England Patriots staged their famous comeback from a 28-3 deficit six years ago.\n\nThe Eagles, who lead 24-14 at the break, finished the first half with a time of possession of 21:54, leaving the Chiefs with 8:06. They ran 44 plays compared to the Chiefs’ 20 and outgained them 270-128.\n\nHere are some other statistics from the first half:\n\nNotable Eagles stats\n\nThird-down efficiency: 6-for-10,\n\nJalen Hurts: 17-for-22, 183 yards, TD; 11 rushes, 63 yards, 2 TD\n\nDeVonta Smith: six catches, 55 yards\n\nA.J Brown: three catches, 74 yards, TD\n\nNotable Chiefs stats\n\nThird-down efficiency:0-for-3\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8-for-13, 89 yards, TD\n\nIsiah Pacheco: five carries, 28 yards\n\nTravis Kelce: three catches, 60 yards, TD\n\nBolton: three tackles, fumble recovery, TD\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles take 24-14 lead at halftime after late field goal\n\nIn the NFC championship game, DeVonta Smith quickly got his team to the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball after a questionable catch on the Eagles’ first drive of their victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt did not work against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nA replay review late in the second quarter showed Smith did not maintain control of the ball after a catch to the Kansas City 13, and it was ruled incomplete. The Eagles tried to snap the ball right away, but since there were less than two minutes in the first half, the officials in the booth called down to the field for a review.\n\nAfter the over turn, A.J. Brown, had a 22-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia in field goal range. Jake Elliott connected from 35 yards out as time expired in the first half, with the Eagles taking a 24-14 advantage into the locker room.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes limps off after appearing to re-injure ankle\n\nWell, Patrick Mahomes’ injured right ankle was looking good until it wasn’t.\n\nMahomes, who was suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional playoff game, scrambled on third down shortly before halftime, and his injured right foot took the brunt of the fall after he was tackled by Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards with 1:44 left in the second quarter.\n\nMahomes limped off the field in obvious pain and was later shown in difficulty while his ankle was being evaluated by trainers on the sidelines.\n\nEarlier in the game, Mahomes appeared to run with ease like his foot was healed after a high-ankle sprain suffered last month.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles back in front on another Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThe Eagles entered the Super Bowl with 35 fourth-down attempts. The 36th and 37th were the most important of the season thus far.\n\nOn fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44, Hurts ran to daylight and converted the first fourth down of the drive with a 28-yard carry down the right sideline. Facing a fourth-and 2, the Eagles got Kansas City to jump inside the red zone to set up a first-and-goal and Hurts scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on the next play to make it 21-14 with just over two minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe drive was 12 plays and took 7:19 off the clock. The Eagles are dominating time of possession. They have had the ball for 20:32, while Mahomes and Kansas City have had it for 7:08.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs erase deficit with defensive touchdown after Eagles miscue\n\nThe Eagles had a seven-point lead and were in Chiefs territory once again.\n\nInstead of putting Kansas City back on its heels, they let them back in the game.\n\nFacing a thrd-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 47, right guard Isaac Seumalo jumped early and moved the Eagles back five yards. On the next play, Hurts began to run on a quarterback keeper, but he dropped the ball and Nick Bolton – the Chiefs’ leading tackler – scooped it up and scored on a 36-yard return that tied the game.\n\nIt was the first fumble Hurts lost since Week 10 against Indianapolis and the team's first turnover of the playoffs.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nA.J. Brown puts Eagles ahead with long touchdown catch\n\nThe ability to hit the big play has been a hallmark for the Eagles offense all season.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, Brown made it.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts had all day in the pocket to watch Brown streak down the field and into double-coverage. Hurts threw to a place anybody who could catch the ball would have to make an adjustment.\n\nJuan Thornhill and McDuffie in coverage weren’t able. Brown did, and the Eagles regain the lead 14-7d on the 45-yard completion.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs fail to take lead as Harrison Butker field goal goes 'doink'\n\nThe Chiefs moved the ball well, but settled for a field-goal attempt when facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of their second drive. Butker’s 42-yard kick drifted left and was no good after hitting the upright, keeping the score tied at 7.\n\nThe possession by the Chiefs drive featured a stellar 22-yard pass from Mahomes to Kelce, and even some trickery from Kansas City. Kelce and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster signaled to the Chiefs sidelines like they did not know a play call, then turned around after Mahomes found running back Jerick McKinnon for a 7-yard completion on the right side.\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception on the next play, and the Chiefs’ field-goal kick miss could come back to haunt them later this game.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles RB Miles Sanders sidelined after hit on game's first play\n\nOn the first play of the game, Sanders carried for a one-yard loss. Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie tracked him down near the sideline and delivered a large hit, knocking the ball out of bounds.\n\nSanders, a fourth-year player from Penn State, was seen shaking his hand after the play and went into the locker room before returning to the field. Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell handled the ball-carrying duting in his absence. Sanders returned to the field in the second quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs respond quickly to tie game against Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs did not waste any time responding to the Eagles’ first score.\n\nChiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes found who else than his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, for a 18-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 with 6:57 left in the first quarter.\n\nMahomes’ first pass of the game was a 20-yard completion to Kelce. More important: Mahomes’ ankle looks great, too, after he galloped for an 8-yard run during the drive.\n\nThe Chiefs got near the red zone with a 24-yard run to the left side by running back Isaiah Pacheco.\n\nKelce also celebrated his touchdown with a dance in the end zone.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles jump out to early Super Bowl lead on Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThe Eagles received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown on the game’s first possession. Jalen Hurts found receiver DeVonta Smith on a key third down and later hit him for 23 yards to move Philadelphia into the red zone on a run-pass option that was initially snuffed out.\n\nKenneth Gainwell initially had the score, but replay review quickly confirmed his elbow was down short of the goal line. The call was Hurts’ specialty: a quarterback sneak. Behind the Eagles’ elite offensive line, Hurts plowed ahead for six points. Extra point was good and it's Philadelphia 7-0 early.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl coin toss, Eagles get ball first\n\nIf you bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl coin toss, congratulations.\n\nThe Chiefs called tails. And the Chiefs won the toss. They chose to defer and will kickoff to the Eagles start the game, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nTails breaks a two-game streak by heads, and has been the coin toss winner in seven of the last 10 Super Bowls, according to Oddsshark.com.\n\nAt +100, one would have doubled their money picking the Chiefs to win the coin toss.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph shine with Super Bowl national anthems\n\nWith nearly as much attention paid to the music as the game during the Super Bowl, the trifecta of artists who took the field Sunday prior to kickoff knew the importance of their platform.\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Babyface were tapped for the honors. Ralph singer infused the Black national anthem - \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" - with the type of gusto exhibited during her Emmy acceptance speech last fall.\n\nBabyface followed with \"America the Beautiful\" and the festivities were capped by Stapleton's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that showcased his vocal skills.\n\nRIGHT NOTE:Reviewing the pregame Super Bowl singing performances\n\n- Mellissa Ruggieri\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni, center Jason Kelce both cry during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nAs Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem before the kick of the Super Bowl, cameras found Sirianni and Kelce, both of whom had tears in their eyes.\n\nKelce spoke about tears on the big stage after the Eagles’ Super Bowl 52 victory, saying he would find himself crying in the shower in the lead-up to that game against the New England Patriots.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nDamar Hamlin introduced on field at Super Bowl 57, speaks to Fox's Michael Strahan\n\nThe NFL continues to celebrate the remarkable recovery by Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin from cardiac arrest he suffered in a Jan. 2 game.\n\nHamlin received a warm ovation from the crowd at State Farm Stadium.\n\nEarlier, on Fox's pregame show, Hamlin spoke with Michael Strahan about what he remembered when he made that fateful tackle on Bengals WR Tee Higgins.\n\nHamlin paused for nearly nine seconds.\n\n\"That's something I don't really want to get too deep into, in the detail,\" Hamlin said. \"That's something I'm still trying to work through. Why did it happen to me?\"\n\nThe full interview will air Monday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nEagles fans boo Cowboys QB Dak Prescott pregame\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received a rousing ovation after being recognized as the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his philanthropy and community impact.\n\nBut not the ovation you’d think one would receive for winning one of the NFL’s highest honors.\n\nEagles fans at the Super Bowl booed Prescott, because division rivalries don’t cease even for special awards.\n\nPrescott was a good sport about the reaction he received.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nWith injured ankle, Patrick Mahomes goes for Super Bowl win No. 2\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl start for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes split his previous two appearances, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54 before losing the championship game the following season against Tom Brady and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes’ recovery from a right high-ankle sprain in the divisional playoff and his dart to the sidelines that set up a game-winning field goal to help the Chiefs beat the Bengals in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29 only added to his growing legacy.\n\nMahomes also has a chance to further separate himself from the rest of the current pack of active quarterbacks. With Brady’s retirement, Mahomes could have more rings than any other with his second championship.\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nThree keys to victory in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe pregame hype is finally dying down and the focus of Super Bowl 57 is ready to be turned to the gridiron where it belongs.\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles have been the class of their respective leagues this season, so the most important thing for either team may only be the ability to execute what they already do well.\n\nHere are three keys to winning, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon:\n\nEagles pass rush vs. Chiefs offensive line\n\nChiefs aerial attack vs. Eagles pass defense\n\nEagles rushing offense vs. Chiefs defense\n\nSuper Bowl X-factors: Unknown to hero?\n\nThe Super Bowl is where a relative nobody can become a household name, a place where Malcolm Butler and David Tyree were transformed from obscurity to an association with football's biggest stage, forever.\n\nThe stars will attract the attention and have the most impact on Super Bowl 57. The X-factors, however – the ones the majority of the 100-plus-million viewers do not know – will also play pivotal roles in determining who lifts the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere are a few who could find themselves in the spotlight on Sunday, according to USA TODAY Sports' Chris Bumbaca:\n\nEagles DT Jason Hargrave\n\nEagles RB Kenneth Gainwell\n\nChiefs OT Andrew Wylie\n\nChiefs LB Nick Bolton\n\nHow do Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts stack up?\n\nThis margin isn't as wide as you might think. Jalen Hurts, 24, is a star who is going to be a problem in the NFC for a long time. He worked with Tom House this offseason and has refined his mechanics. His ability to compromise defenses with his rushing ability has made it increasingly difficult to defend Philadelphia. And, if the Chiefs use a spy to try to limit what Hurts can do out in open space, it takes away a potential defender Kansas City can use in the secondary.\n\nAll that said, Patrick Mahomes is the most gifted passer in the NFL, possibly of all time. His arm makes it so that the Chiefs can score on any given play. And while he may not rack up rushing yards, his mobility — though it may be tested Sunday by a high ankle sprain — allows him to extend plays and find receivers who can break off their routes.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhere Kansas City has a potential home run hitter in Isiah Pacheco, the Eagles carry significant depth in the backfield. Philadelphia’s top three running backs — Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell — are all capable of taking over a game. Just look at Gainwell’s production; he averaged just 3.1 rushes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs, that number has jumped to 13 per and he has responded by leading the Eagles in rushing in both the divisional and conference championship rounds. Sanders, meanwhile, has a nose for the end zone.\n\nPacheco is explosive both rushing the ball and catching it out of the backfield, but Kansas City often doesn’t give him enough touches to be a major factor. The team also activated Clyde Edwards-Helaire (ankle) off of injured reserve and he’d provide a huge boost if he’s able to play.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is perhaps the one position where a team has the strongest advantage over the other. A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are both star playmakers whose different skill sets complement each other; Brown is physical and quick and can beat defenders with power and Smith is a silky route runner who is elusive in space.\n\nOn the other side, the Chiefs have navigated their first season without Tyreek Hill quite well, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney making plays. Still, no Kansas City wideout eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in the regular season. Making matters worse for the Chiefs is that they are facing several nagging injuries at the position, with Mecole Hardman placed on injured reserve. Better put this way, Mahomes and the Chiefs system elevate Smith-Schuster, Valdes-Scantling and Toney, while Brown and Smith are stars who would flourish anywhere.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDallas Goedert has been a solid and steady option for Hurts. But in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, he reached the 100-yard mark only once.\n\nTravis Kelce isn’t just in the conversation for the best tight end in football — he’s already there — he’s in the conversation for the best of all time. Kelce has secured four All-Pro nominations in the last seven seasons, he’s rewriting the record book and he has become Mahomes’ preferred target and a near-unguardable player in the middle of the field.\n\nGoedert does have a clear advantage over Kelce in run blocking; because Philadelphia sets its identity on the ground, Goedert has become a key piece in the scheme. Still, Kelce is generational.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWho are the commentators on FOX NFL Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show?\n\nAs is the case during the regular season, Fox Sports has Curt Menefee hosting its NFL Sunday pregame show, which is being broadcast live at State Farm Stadium.\n\nProviding analysis and commentary are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson. Joining the set for the playoffs is retired NFL tight end-turned-kicker Rob Gronkowski.\n\nReporting from around the stadium: Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi, Charissa Thompson and Jay Glazer.\n\nStars from every industry are descending on State Farm Stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn the stadium early was NBA star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.\n\nEagles superfan Bradley Cooper was also in attendance ready to cheer his team to victory.\n\nRap mogul Jay Z was spotted on the sidelines taking pictures of his daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Travis Kelce, Fletcher Cox make fashion statements as kickoff approaches\n\nEveryone knows what the players will be wearing when Super Bowl 57 kicks off. The Chiefs will be wearing white uniforms with red pants, red numerals and yellow trim. The Eagles will be wearing green uniforms with either green or white pants.\n\nHowever, pregame fashions can be any style and color under the rainbow, as evidenced by Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chiefs TE Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd then there's Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.\n\nThis is another fascinating battle, as these are two of the top units in the NFL. The Eagles, however, have the best O-line in football. Their communication and ability to work together are unrivaled. They have two of the best players at their positions, center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson (both of whom were first-team All-Pro selections). They bore open holes in Nick Sirianni’s zone read offense and are disciplined and clean in avoiding penalties.\n\nBut where Philadelphia has two All-Pros on its offensive line, the Chiefs have a pair of second-teamers in center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney. Orlando Brown has been excellent after moving to left tackle and, considering this is a unit that has been remade, it has done a remarkable job of keeping Mahomes clean.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Eagles are five sacks in the Super Bowl from breaking the record of the 1984 Bears for total sacks in the regular and postseason combined (82). Three of Philadelphia’s starting four defensive linemen, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham notched double-digit sack totals in the regular season, as each posted 11. The other starter, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, is one of the game’s best interior linemen and recorded seven. The unit has depth with end Robert Quinn and tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh coming on in relief.\n\nTo be clear, the Chiefs aren’t bad, they’re just not this good. Chris Jones is a force and the best interior lineman in football and Frank Clark can disrupt the timing and rhythm of opposing offenses. Kansas City just doesn’t have the depth or wealth of star talent to match Philadelphia in this spot.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s almost unfair to consider Haason Reddick as a pure linebacker, since Philadelphia loves using him in five-man fronts, rushing off the left side of the line of scrimmage — or even at defensive tackle — so his presence is frankly more of a consideration for the defensive line. With that in mind, where this Eagles defense is weakest is at the other two linebacker spots. And, considering that linebackers and safeties are among the players asked to cover tight ends, this could be a spot where the Chiefs exploit Philadelphia, using Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs unit that included Nick Bolton and Willie Gay Jr. took some time to get settled this season, but it improved after Gay returned from suspension and as the group got healthier. They have speed and excellent range, though they are sometimes caught out of position, in part because of the relative inexperience of Bolton and Gay.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is another spot in which Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive moves in recent seasons have paid off. The three best players on the unit — corners James Bradberry and Darius Slay and strong safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson — were all acquired via trade or free agency. Bradberry had bounced around the league but found a home in Philadelphia’s defense, earning a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nFor the Chiefs, cornerback L’Jarius Sneed clearing concussion protocol is a welcome sight; he doesn’t shy away from contact and actually helps out quite a bit in stopping the run along the outside. Trent McDuffie is a player who has perhaps been overlooked, though he has had a huge impact as a press corner. Rounding out the starters, at safety, Justin Reid and Juan Thornhill have become capable players. The biggest issue with the Kansas City secondary is the occasional blown coverage that can lead to chunk plays.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAs far as kicking and punting goes, this becomes tricky because where the Eagles are strong with place kicker Jake Elliott, the Chiefs are stronger with punter Tommy Townsend, a first-team all-pro. Kansas City place kicker Harrison Butker had the worst season of his career, missing six field goals for a 75% conversion rate. Still, in his last three games, Butker has converted all field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Eagles may be without punter Arryn Siposs (ankle), who has said he is ready to play. He presents an upgrade, though backup Brett Kern has been solid in relief. Where the Chiefs separate themselves is with their return men. Both Isiah Pacheco and Skyy Moore are flashes of lightning who can slip through creases and flip field position.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Chiefs have the wealth of experience and Andy Reid may be the best coach not named Belichick over the last three decades. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should be a head coach. And defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has kept Kansas City’s defense competitive and loves to disguise blitzes, making it difficult for young quarterbacks to read the field.\n\nThe narrative that the Eagles have had a favorable path to the Super Bowl, while accurate, shouldn’t discount the effort and work it takes to win week in and week out. Coach Nick Sirianni’s players swear by him and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen could end up as a head coach this cycle. The zone read offense the pair have assembled requires defenses to make decisions in split seconds. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker brings decades of experience and coordinator Jonathan Gannon oversees a unit that has taken a huge stride since last season.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs unlikely to face 49ers catastrophe if Mahomes gets hurt\n\nThe NFC championship game was a cautionary tale to NFL teams, particularly those vying for a title, about the risks of having only two quarterbacks active on game day.\n\nHowever, if catastrophe befalls the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl 57, they have a plethora of emergency quarterback options – so many, that it's not immediately clear who would take snaps if presumptive MVP Patrick Mahomes and his, backup, Chad Henne, were unable to go. Obviously, that would be a worst-case scenario. But at least the AFC champs might become so wildly unpredictable that it could keep them in a game – at least temporarily.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEx-Broncos coach helps Eagles prepare for Chiefs offense\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reportedly brought in some veteran experience ahead of their Super Bowl 57 appearance against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAccording to reports, the Eagles hired Vic Fangio to assist with game preparations that include self-scouting and analysis. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported Fangio signed a two-week contract that is expected to expire after the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio agreed to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator last month.\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nFathers of Super Bowl 57 QBs wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nDuring Super Bowl 57 you will see more than a game. You'll see two Black quarterbacks — raised lovingly by two Black dads (and also by their moms). You will also see one more thing: a stereotype busted.\n\nIf you're looking for the story — the often repeated one, the ever-lasting one, the stereotypical one — of the Black kid who grew up impoverished and still made it. If you're looking for the same ol' story about the Black kid without a father who overcame this and that and the other thing and golly gee, goodness gracious look at him now. Well, this Super Bowl quarterbacks story is not for you.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nSpecial game-day deliveries for 2 Chiefs players\n\nJust playing in the big game is already memorable enough, but two members of the Kansas City Chiefs will have even more reason to remember this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nWhile he was busy preparing to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti learned his wife Christina went into labor and delivered healthy twin girls early Sunday morning in Chicago.\n\nAt about the same time the Allegretti girls were arriving, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman was frantically tweeting that his girlfriend Chariah Gordon was also about ready to give birth.\n\nThere could also be another Super Bowl baby before long on the other sideline.\n\nEagles center Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are also expecting a baby.\n\nAndy Reid could win second Super Bowl – against his former team\n\nReid, 64, is a no-nonsense coach who has become endearing, never too shy to be himself or make others laugh at his own expense. He proudly wears Hawaiian shirts and professes his love for a good cheeseburger. He’s also one of the most accomplished coaches.\n\nReid was the Eagles’ coach for 14 seasons (1999-2012) and did mostly everything for the franchise – six NFC East titles, five NFC title games, one Super Bowl appearance – except win it all.\n\nWhen he was fired by Philadelphia, Kansas City pounced at the opportunity to hire him, and it has been rewarded with 10 winning seasons, nine playoff berths and a Super Bowl during the 2019 season.\n\nReid has the respect and the résumé to match, and he has an opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame career with a second Super Bowl title. To do it against his former team would be special, too.\n\nSUPER BOWL STORYLINES: Reid, Kelce brothers, Mahomes' ankle all worth watching\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nWho will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nWhile the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles take a break from shining bright like a diamond, Rihanna will be the Super Bowl 57 halftime show performer.\n\nIt's a show that's so exciting, at least one player is hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy award-winner will perform a slew of hits with (or maybe without) some surprise guests. This will be her first public performance since 2018 when she performed DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" at the Grammys.\n\n– Victoria Hernandez\n\nWith 10 Super Bowl appearances, Tom Brady has made his mark on the game's history, setting a plethora of individual records.\n\nBrady, who made 10 Super Bowl appearances with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice – who appeared in four Super Bowls during his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders – hold multiple standards in the NFL's annual championship showcase.\n\nFrom a team perspective, Brady's New England Patriots and Rice's San Francisco 49ers figure prominently.\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any legendary marks be surpassed in Super Bowl 57?\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY: All-time results, winners, MVPs, more\n\nSUPER BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: Nate Davis' 57 greatest moments in Super Bowl lore\n\nHow 'No crush, no rush' slogan has Philadelphia Eagles defense on historic sack pace\n\nThe four-word phrase coined by defensive ends and outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn means the defense has to stop the run to earn the right to rush the quarterback. Entering Super Bowl 57, the defense has lived up to its motto.\n\n“If you don’t stop the run, you can’t pass rush nobody,” Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham said. “You got to take care of business. Early on, you got to send a message and let them know what the game is gonna be. You got to be the dictators. That’s any defense that wants to win a game, you got to let them know what it’s gonna be for the day.”\n\nThe Eagles had the NFL’s second ranked defense in the regular season and the unit hasn’t given up more than seven points in each of its postseason wins leading up to Super Bowl 57. When it comes to rushing the quarterback, the Eagles are on an historic pace.\n\nThe Eagles defense has amassed 78 total sacks across the regular season and postseason, the third most in NFL history. Philadelphia is three sacks away from surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears for the second most sacks ever and five sacks shy of eclipsing the 1984 Bears (82 sacks) for the NFL single-season record.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJoe Biden's pregame Super Bowl interview with Fox called off\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t be giving a pregame Super Bowl interview to Fox Soul after all.\n\nPresidents in recent years have granted wide-ranging interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl. But last week there was confusion over whether Biden would follow the tradition.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted Friday that Biden had been looking forward to an interview on Fox Soul, a streaming sister service to the conservative Fox News. But she said the White House had been informed that the network’s parent company, Fox Corp., canceled the interview.\n\nBiden did pregame interviews with CBS in 2021 and with NBC in 2022.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Superhero?' What other Chiefs say about QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nPatrick Mahomes exploded into an NFL superstar almost from the moment when he became the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018, the year he also won his first MVP trophy.\n\nBut what we all see is not necessarily what Mahomes' teammates see.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports closely monitored and asked Chiefs players and coaches during the days leading up to the big game about what it's like being around their intrepid leader, and some common themes quickly emerged.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEagles' success starts at the top\n\nTo compare the team-building philosophies of the Philadelphia Eagles and last year's Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, and classify them as similar would be to miss the point.\n\nThere is a difference between mortgaging the future and having a foundation for continued success in place. The Rams, quite literally, employed a “(expletive) them picks” strategy. The Eagles have a pair of first-round picks in the 2023 draft and Jalen Hurts, an MVP-level quarterback on a rookie (second-round selection) contract.\n\nLeadership starts at the top. Knowing the right time to push the chips toward the middle is essential to winning it all, and Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has given general manager Howie Roseman, who has been with the organization since 2000, the latitude – and payroll – to be aggressive.\n\nIn Super Bowl 57 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roseman's fingerprints will be all over the field.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\n'Special' Super Bowl for Black quarterbacks\n\nWhen Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts take the field Feb. 12, they will be the first two Black quarterbacks to start against each other in the Super Bowl. It’s an accomplishment both quarterbacks fully embrace.\n\n“It is history. It’s come a long way. I think there has only been (eight) African American quarterbacks to play in a Super Bowl. To be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it’ll be a good one,” Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, told reporters Thursday. “It’s history.”\n\nThere will be eight Black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl once the championship game kicks off: Doug Williams, Steve McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Mahomes and Hurts.\n\n– Tyler Dragon\n\nTHE 100-YEAR LONG ROAD: Fritz Pollard paved the way for Hurts, Mahomes\n\nOPINION: Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nReport: Colts target Eagles offensive coordinator as next head coach\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have reached a decision on who they want as their next head coach – but the process will have to wait until Super Bowl 57 concludes.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the Colts' top choice, and, according to ESPN, the team has already begun informing the other candidates that they are no longer being considered.\n\nSteichen, 37, has run the Eagles offense for the past two seasons. On the way to reaching the Super Bowl, Philadelphia ranked first in rushing yards and third in points per game in 2022. That would seem to mesh well with the Colts, whose offense revolves around 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor.\n\nIn addition, the Arizona Cardinals plan to interview Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon for their head coaching vacancy, according to NFL.com.\n\nEx-Eagles, Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil can't pick a favorite\n\nDick Vermeil led the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance. He also finished his Hall of Fame career coaching the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSo, in what direction is Vermeil’s allegiance flowing for Super Bowl 57?\n\n“I’ve put in my frame of mind right now, philosophically, I’m going to root for both teams to win,” Vermeil told USA TODAY Sports. “And I’ll feel very bad for the team that loses.”\n\nThe only person other than Andy Reid to have coached both the Eagles and the Chiefs, Vermeil, 86, won’t even be inside State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\n– Jarrett Bell\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any of these marks be broken in Super Bowl 57?\n\nJason or Travis?

He's never had a losing season. Never lost back-to-back regular-season games.

Or do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with the Second Lady — they'll make some salads.\n\n\"(No), I said, you guys aren't into salads.\"\n\nThough the White House did not initially detail the amount of fast food and its costs, Trump said he ordered \"about 1,000 hamburgers\" for the group. He believed the football players would enjoy the meal because they have some \"very large people that like eating.\"\n\nThe result was an unusual scene in the East Room, where empty boxes of Big Macs sat atop intricately embroidered tablecloths and the ornate room smelled lightly of grease.\n\nAs the Clemson contingent finished eating, Trump stepped to the podium and spent much of his time praising the Tigers' 44-16 win over the Crimson Tide. He singled out wide receiver Hunter Renfrow, defensive coordinator Brent Venables, cornerback A.J. Terrell and Lawrence in his remarks.\n\n\"Oh I want to be the agent for that tall, handsome quarterback,\" Trump said of Lawrence. \"Six foot seven, they say great athlete, and he's accurate. That's nice.\"\n\nIt was the Tigers' second trip to the White House in less than two years, making Clemson the only repeat visitor among championship sports teams since Trump took office. The program previously met with Trump in the summer of 2017, roughly five months after its previous title-game victory that completed the 2016 season.\n\nMonday's celebration also came just seven days after the national title game — an unusually quick turnaround for a team's White House visit.\n\nTrump announced the visit in a tweet Friday, and expressed excitement about the unique menu for the event Monday morning before flying to New Orleans to address the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention. Clemson, meanwhile, spent part of Monday afternoon on the National Mall, including a pit stop at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\"What a fun day it's been,\" Swinney said during his remarks in the East Room. \"It's an honor to be a part of this tradition, and to be honest with you, it's really cool that football can create an opportunity like this.\"\n\nWhite House visits have long been a tradition for championship teams and athletes, but they have become increasingly sporadic under Trump. None of the four NCAA men's and women's basketball champions have visited the White House under Trump, nor have the two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe most recent NFL champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, were initially invited to visit last summer before Trump learned that they would not be sending a large delegation and rescinded the invitation. The defending World Series champion Red Sox have accepted a White House invitation but a date for the visit has yet to be announced.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/14"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA’s first spacecraft designed to study a metallic asteroid won’t be launching this year as planned, according to an announcement made by the agency on Friday.\n\nThe Psyche mission’s 2022 launch window, which opened on August 1 and closes on October 11, will come to an end before the spacecraft’s flight software is ready. A delay in delivering the software and its testing equipment has prevented the Psyche team from having enough time for testing prior to launch.\n\nEngineers want to be absolutely sure that the software will function as expected once the spacecraft is in flight.\n\nUsed to control the spacecraft’s orientation as it flies through space, guidance and navigation software help point its antenna toward Earth for communications and relaying data. The software also provides the spacecraft’s propulsion system with trajectory information.\n\nDuring testing at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, engineers discovered a compatibility issue in the software’s test bed simulators. The issue has since been corrected, but there isn’t enough time for a full checkout and launch in 2022.\n\nThe space agency will form an independent assessment team to review the mission and determine a path forward, including estimated costs and potential launch opportunities in 2023 and 2024. The Psyche spacecraft is currently housed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nEngineers prepare the Psyche spacecraft inside a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on April 11. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Flying to a distant metal-rich asteroid, using Mars for a gravity assist on the way there, takes incredible precision. We must get it right. Hundreds of people have put remarkable effort into Psyche during this pandemic, and the work will continue as the complex flight software is thoroughly tested and assessed,” said JPL Director Laurie Leshin. “The decision to delay the launch wasn’t easy, but it is the right one.”\n\nTiming for the mission makes things difficult moving forward. A 2022 launch would have delivered the spacecraft to the asteroid, also known as Psyche, by 2026. But launch periods in the coming years mean that the spacecraft would arrive much later due to different orbital positions, such as 2029 or 2030.\n\n“Our amazing team has overcome almost all of the incredible challenges of building a spacecraft during Covid,” said Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Psyche’s principal investigator and foundation and regents professor at Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.\n\n“We have conquered numerous hardware and software challenges, and we’ve been stopped in the end by this one last problem. We just need a little more time and will get this one licked, too. The team is ready to move forward, and I’m so grateful for their excellence.”\n\nThe delay will also halt two projects that were set to ride along with Psyche on the same SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at launch.\n\nThe first is NASA’s Janus mission, which was designed to study twin binary asteroid systems, and the second is the Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration. This demo is designed to test high-data-rate laser communications that could change the way ground teams communicate with spacecraft across deep space.\n\nThe spacecraft also has a number of innovations, like ion propulsion rather than traditional rocket fuel.\n\nIf the decision is made to launch Psyche in the coming years, the spacecraft will embark on a 280 million-mile (450 million-kilometer) journey. The Psyche asteroid is so metal-rich, some scientists believe it’s the exposed core of a planetesimal, or a planet in the making that separated into layers.\n\nCollisions with other celestial objects over time might have stripped away the outer layers, exposing the remaining metallic core. If Psyche truly is a core, studying it would be like peering inside the very heart of a planet like Earth.\n\nThe potato-shaped asteroid only appears as a fuzzy blur to ground- and space-based telescopes. The unusual object could also be a piece of primordial material that never melted, according to NASA.\n\nThis rendering shows how scientists think the Psyche asteroid appears up close. MaxarASU/P. Rubin/NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe results from the assessment team will determine if this mission launches in the coming years or becomes grounded.\n\n“I want to stress that NASA remains fully committed to scientific discovery and exploration of small bodies,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.\n\n“This is exemplified by our existing missions OSIRIS-REx, Lucy and DART.

It is mostly only visible from the Southern Hemisphere and is one of the “pointers” to the Southern Cross constellation that appears on the country’s flag, according to Reuters.\n\nMonday’s event also made history for Australia as the first commercial space launch in the country. It was the first of three launches, with a further two planned for July 4 and July 12. These will carry out astrophysical studies that can only be done from the Southern Hemisphere, according to NASA.\n\nMichael Jones, executive chairman and group CEO of ELA, said it was a historic night.\n\n“We could never have dreamed of having such a supportive, experienced and professional partner as NASA. They have been unbelievably generous in helping us through this journey and we will be a much better organization for their support,” Jones said in a statement.\n\n“Today’s launch not only puts ELA at the forefront of global commercial space launch, it also confirms that we and Australia can provide access to space and this is just the beginning for us,” he added.\n\nAustralian National University astrophysicist Brad Tucker, who was on site to watch the launch, said wind and rain beforehand had caused some nervousness about whether it would go ahead.\n\nBut after a delay of more than an hour, excitement broke out as the rocket took off.\n\n“At that final time, nearly everyone ran outside to see the launch and watch in awe. Even after we lost sight of the rocket, people stood outside for such a long time,” Tucker said.\n\nTucker said the suborbital missions were aimed at better understanding the star systems and whether any habitable planets existed there.\n\nNASA is the first client for the commercial spaceport operated by ELA and 70 of its staff have traveled to Australia for the three missions.\n\nThe American space agency said the mission will study the evolution of galaxies by measuring X-rays produced by hot gases that fill the space between stars.\n\nThe Arnhem Space Center describes itself as the only commercially owned and run multi-user equatorial launch site in the world.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/06/nasa-psyche-mission-october-launch-metallic-asteroid/70292286007/", "title": "NASA's Psyche mission on track for fall launch to metallic asteroid ...", "text": "NASA's long-awaited mission to send a spacecraft to explore a metal-rich asteroid is on track to launch in October following a one-year delay, the agency announced Monday.\n\nThe Psyche spacecraft, named for the asteroid to which it is bound, was initially expected to take off in August before the mission team requested to delay the launch due to software problems and institutional issues at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNASA and its JPL in Pasadena, California convened an independent review board last summer to assess the factors that contributed to the delay. That board issued a report on May 30 finding that steps taken by NASA and the California Institute of Technology since November to get the delayed mission back on track have been “outstanding\" and have \"exceeded expectations,\" according to the Monday announcement.\n\nThe JPL, which the California Institute of Technology manages on behalf of NASA, now lists the launch window as Oct. 5-25.\n\nMars live stream:Watch spacecraft stream images from red planet in first-its-kind event\n\n“I am pleased with the independent review board’s resoundingly positive assessment of JPL’s hard work in correcting the issues outlined in the board’s original report,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement. “We know the work is not over. As we move forward, we will work with JPL to ensure these implemented changes continue to be prioritized to position Psyche and the other missions in JPL’s portfolio for success.”\n\nWhat caused the delay?\n\nPsyche team members scuttled plans last year to launch the spacecraft before the launch window closed on Oct. 11 partially due to concerns that the in-flight software was not ready, NASA said in October.\n\nThe review board, led by retired aerospace executive A. Thomas Young, also concluded that workforce issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the delay.\n\nIn response, the Psyche mission added more team members, reorganized part of its workforce and adopted metrics to ensure that the launch was on track. Among the changes was an update to the JPL's hybrid work policy to increase the number of days team members spend together onsite each week.\n\nThe review board's report also noted improvements to senior management’s oversight of the mission, according to NASA.\n\nMore:Two minerals, never-before-seen on Earth, found in one of planet's largest known meteorites\n\n“The independent review board is extraordinarily impressed by the accomplishments of the total JPL organization and Caltech,” the report authors noted. “Engagement in and leadership of the overall response process by the JPL director and senior leadership is deemed ‘world class.'\"\n\nWhat is the Psyche mission?\n\nNASA began planning its Psyche mission in 2017 to investigate the previously unexplored metallic asteroid of the same name as part of the agency’s Discovery Program formed in 1992.\n\nThis October, the Psyche spacecraft will finally embark on a 280 million-mile journey, reaching the asteroid Psyche in August 2029.\n\nFrom 2017:NASA planning mission to an asteroid worth $10,000 quadrillion\n\nAssembly of the spacecraft is complete except for the installation of the solar arrays and the imagers, which were to be reinstalled before June.\n\nThis month, the mission begins its final assembly, test, and launch operations. Engineers and technicians from NASA’s JPL will return to Astrotech Space Operations Facility near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where they will work until the launch.\n\nScientists hope that as Psyche orbits the metallic asteroid for 26 months, secrets could be revealed of Earth's own core, as well as those of other terrestrial planets.\n\nAs planetary bodies take shape within star-circling rings of gas and dust, they may be smashed, broken up, vaporized or face other mayhem. Few become terrestrial planets like Earth — atmospheres intact with metallic interiors and outer crusts.\n\nPsyche — a 140-mile wide chunk of metal and rock on the solar system's asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter — didn't turn out that way. NASA scientists theorize that the asteroid could be a partial exposed core composed of nickel-iron, the shattered remnants of an early planet.\n\nEarth's own metallic core is unreachable, far below the planet's rocky mantle and crust. But if Psyche is indeed a core, scientists believe that studying it could yield valuable insights about the heart of our own planet.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Can you tell me why this is happening? The amount that is falling seems to be a lot more than normal.\n\nA: It’s normal for all types of citrus trees to drop some immature fruit at this time of year. This self-thinning is nature’s way of making sure the tree does not become too overburdened with fruit. However, if your tree is dropping a lot of the immature fruit then it could be for one of several reasons. I have listed a few of the most common ones below.\n\nChanges in weather can stress your citrus tree and cause fruit to drop. We have experienced some extremes in the weather the past couple of weeks, with an almost 50-degree difference in temperatures from one day to the next. I’m not sure what variety of Mandarin you have, but the Satsuma Mandarins — while cold tolerant — are very sensitive to the heat and are more likely to drop immature fruit than other varieties when temperatures spike in May and June.\n\nThere is not a lot you can do to change the weather, but you can help mitigate the stress on your tree by keeping the tree well-watered when the temperature spikes. If your tree is in a pot, this may mean watering it every day.\n\nDroughted trees can be another cause of fruit drop and, if the lack of water is severe enough or occurs frequently, may also cause leaves to yellow and fall off the tree.\n\nUniversity of California Cooperative Extension professor Nick Sakovich wrote in the U.C. Agriculture and Natural Resources bulletin, “Water stress during the late spring/early summer can cause a yield reduction, otherwise known as June drop (although some drop is normal). Once we get past that period, trees can tolerate substantial water stress without crop loss. However, what will happen if we don't apply adequate water will be a significant reduction in fruit size.”\n\nTo prevent excessive fruit drop from happening make sure to water deeply and frequently during hot spells. Adding a layer of mulch under your tree can help protect the tree from drying out between watering and subsequently protect against the loss of immature fruit.\n\nMore stories:\n\nWhat's causing the spots on the leaves of my tomato plants?\n\nNorth State farmers markets are back for summer. Here's how they're adapting to COVID-19\n\nA nitrogen deficiency can also be the cause of fruit drop. This time of year is when trees need the most nutrients as they are blooming and setting fruit. Mandarin trees need between one and 1.5 pounds of actual nitrogen per year. This works out to a total yearly application of approximately eight to 12 pounds of a fertilizer formulated for citrus. The University of California recommends applying fertilizer in three applications spread out over the spring and summer months. For our climate, I suggest applying these three applications in February, April and June.\n\nExcessive pruning or a severe pest infestation can also cause excess fruit drop.\n\nFor more information on growing citrus, check out the University of California’s citrus growing resources on “The California Backyard Orchard” website at https://bit.ly/2XW4pIr.\n\nThe Shasta Master Gardeners Program can be reached by phone at 242-2219 or email mastergardener@shastacollege.edu.

No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/01/22/heavy-snow-hits-mountains/79157550/", "title": "Heavy snow hits mountains; problems to last into next week", "text": "Leah Buletti, and Emily Patrick\n\nThe Citizen-Times\n\nFor the latest news and observations, follow our live snow blog here.\n\nASHEVILLE - A winter storm that blanketed Asheville with up to a foot of snow Friday was expected to linger only briefly into the weekend. But the headaches left behind promise to last into next week.\n\nThe National Weather Service was forecasting 8 to 12 inches of snow in the area by early Saturday morning, with the storm tapering after that.\n\nTemperatures aren’t forecast to get above freezing until Sunday, when the high is expected to be 40 degrees.\n\n“Tomorrow it’s just a question of how long it takes for things to improve,” said Bill Martin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Greer, South Carolina. “It’s not going to be above freezing until Sunday, so we’re not going to get a lot of melting or clearing of any ice until then. I would think the roads would still be problematic. Ice is going to still be around.”\n\nA record snowfall for Jan. 22 was set Friday with 10.6 inches falling in Asheville, breaking the old record of 8.8 inches set in 1987, the weather service announced.\n\nRoads around Asheville Friday morning — interstates and secondary roads — were heavily covered with snow and ice, and dispatchers in several counties said numerous motorists slid off slick roadways. The state Department of Transportation said plows likely wouldn't reach secondary roads until it stops snowing.\n\nWith the exception of stranded motorists and a downed utility pole that closed Sand Hill Road in West Asheville, no major problems were reported in Buncombe County.\n\n\"We’re just all ready to respond to whatever,\" said Jerry VeHaun, director of emergency services for Buncombe County. \"It’s been fairly quiet. I think a lot of people stayed home.\"\n\nAsheville city facilities and Buncombe County offices were closed to the public Friday.\n\nBuncombe, Henderson, Haywood and Macon counties as well as the city of Asheville have declared states of emergencies through Sunday. The declaration helps counties mobilize emergency aid and services for rehabilitation in major public safety situations.\n\nDuke Energy was reporting as many as 3,000 customers without power in Western North Carolina counties around noon, primarily in far western counties. On Friday evening, more than 7,000 customers were without power in the West Asheville area, but service was restored after around an hour.\n\nDuke said the company was closely monitoring the situation and preparing to deploy crews as snow, sleet and freezing rain continued to fall across the Carolinas and many parts of the Southeast.\n\nIn addition to the company’s more than 3,200 line and tree workers and contractors, about 3,600 personnel from Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Indiana, Oklahoma, Michigan and Texas began arriving Thursday in Raleigh, Charlotte, Asheville and the Greenville-Spartanburg area.\n\nMotorists should expect bad roads through Monday, as daytime snow melt could lead to black ice Sunday night and Monday morning, forecasters said.\n\nTroopers had received about 150 calls for service between midnight Thursday and late Friday morning, said Trooper Kelly Rhodes with the North Carolina Highway Patrol. About 70 were for accidents and the rest were for stranded motorists, trees across roads and similar incidents.\n\nSnowfall in the Asheville area and throughout Western North Carolina varied dramatically by location.\n\nAround noon Friday, the National Weather Service recorded the highest snowfall – 12 inches – in Fairview. However, the service hadn’t received a report from Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi, which holds several snowfall records. Park officials said 11 inches had fallen at the park at 7 a.m., but updated numbers weren’t available.\n\nThe record one-day snowfall in Buncombe County is 20 inches in Montreat that was measured March 3, 1942, according to data from the State Climate Office. A total of 17.5 inches fell in Bent Creek on March 13, 1993. The area’s third-highest one-day snowfall came Dec. 3, 1971, when 16.3 inches were recorded in Asheville.\n\nStatewide, Mount Mitchell in Yancey County has claim to the top three greatest one-day snowfalls. Topping the list is 36 inches on March 13, 1993.\n\nKnown as the Storm of the Century, a two-day whiteout in March 1993 dumped 2 feet of snow on the Western North Carolina mountains. The storm left a dozen people dead, cut power to more than 100,000 customers, and caused more than $75 million in damage.\n\nFor many people in Asheville, Friday was a day off work or school and an opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, with many sledding and skiing on the streets in West Asheville.\n\nBrad Raines, a West Asheville resident, had the day off work. He’s a machine operator, and he normally drives a bulldozer, so the snow left his rig out of commission.\n\nFriday morning he was out scouting West Asheville on foot for coffee and cigarettes. The coffee was easy to come by since West Village Market and West End Bakery were open, but the cigarettes were tricky since the gas stations were closed.\n\n“I met a man that was walking downtown. He had to go to work. I felt sorry for him because it’s kind of a long haul from here,” Raines said. “Hopefully he gets a ride from someone with four-wheel-drive because the conditions are kind of terrible.”\n\nJosh Ballard, who lives in West Asheville, said he woke up to find snow and decided he wanted coffee and a scone from West End Bakery. He was outside shoveling the parking lot on Haywood Road in what he called \"a little work trade.\"\n\n\"I like being outside, so I’m just out here enjoying the snow,\" he said.\n\nOthers were less enthused.\n\n\"I've been in Alaska for the last three years, so this is not a big deal to me,\" said Army Capt. Charles Chapa, who lives in Canton but was traveling in West Asheville for work Friday.\n\nRobert Eaton got stuck in the snow when he tried to pull his car back into a driveway in Arden.\n\n“I don’t like snow. I never have,” Eaton said. “I wish it would go away.”\n\nEaton left the house earlier to pick up some medication for a person he was taking care of. When he tried to get back up the hill, the car wouldn’t cooperate.\n\nLike emergency dispatchers, neighbor Alan Cullings urged everyone to just \"stay home.\"\n\nStaff writer Mark Barrett contributed.\n\nSnowfall totals through Friday afternoon:\n\nTypical: 4-8 inches\n\nAvery Creek: 9 inches\n\nMcDowell: 8 inches\n\nWeaverville: 3 inches\n\nAshe County: 6 inches\n\nClyde: 4 inches\n\nCope Creek, Waynesville: 7 inches\n\nNorth of Waynesville: 9 inches\n\nTransylvania County: 7 inches\n\nMount LeConte in the Smokies: 13 inches\n\nTravel information:\n\n​Nearly all flights scheduled to depart Friday from Asheville Regional Airport were either canceled or delayed.\n\nFreezing rain fell on Greenville and Charlotte, making driving conditions in those areas difficult.\n\nSnowplows were able to keep interstate highways reasonably passable Friday except when blocked by accidents, but primary roads with U.S. and N.C. numbers and especially secondary roads were in worse condition.\n\nWestbound lanes of Interstate 26 between Columbus and Saluda in Polk County were blocked for about four hours Friday morning and traffic backed up to the South Carolina line. About 10 tractor-trailers were involved in related accidents there in which some got stuck in the ditch and others jack-knifed, troopers said. The state Department of Transportation had to bring in heavy equipment to move the trucks from travel lanes on the steep section of highway that is part of WNC's main connection to South Carolina.\n\nSeparate accidents closed eastbound lanes of Interstate 40 in the Pigeon River Gorge and outside Canton for good chunks of Friday morning, but they were also cleared by midday.\n\nDOT workers had plowed interstate highways in Buncombe County. They were generally passable, although they still had snow on them, said Justin Rice, a DOT maintenance engineer. Primary and secondary roads were not in as good a condition, he said, and wind blowing snow across roads after they are plowed made matters worse.\n\nAll 469 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway were closed, and U.S. 441 between Cherokee and Gatlinburg, Tennessee, was closed.\n\nStorm news from around NC\n\nNor’easter on Outer Banks\n\nRALEIGH – By Friday morning, state Department of Transportation crews had placed nearly 2 million gallons of a saltwater mixture called brine on major highways and roads. That work began Tuesday and continued through Thursday. DOT equipment was in place on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, where the storm could become a nor’easter.\n\n\n\nFlight cancellations\n\nCHARLOTTE - In a news release Friday, Charlotte-Douglas International Airport said all operations were canceled for American Airlines, Regionals, Delta, United, Southwest, Lufthansa, Air Canada, ViaAir and JetBlue.\n\nRaleigh-Durham International Airport tweeted Friday that 12 Delta and United flights were scheduled for early in the day, with a few more Delta flights scheduled for later. Airport officials said in a news release Thursday that JetBlue and Southwest had canceled all flights for Friday and Saturday and expected to resume operations Sunday.\n\nAfter its flights early Friday, the airport said American expected to resume flying Saturday.\n\nStorm deaths\n\nRALEIGH - Gov. Pat McCrory said the death toll from the winter storm in North Carolina stood at four around noon Friday.\n\nThe most recent death occurred Friday, when a driver lost control of a truck on Interstate 95 in Johnston County and crossed both southbound lanes, McCrory said. A Wilkes County man who was injured in a wreck Wednesday evening also has died, he said.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a Forsyth County woman and a Stokes County woman were killed in separate wrecks.\n\nHighway Patrol Commander Col. William Gray says troopers have responded to 571 wrecks and more than 800 calls for service since midnight Friday.\n\nOfficials said lanes of Interstate 95 and 40 were closed Friday. Secondary and rural roads were treacherous while Transportation Department crews concentrate first on major routes.\n\nIce a bigger problem down east\n\nRALEIGH – The National Weather Service said Friday afternoon that portions of North Carolina impacted by the winter storm may see more ice than snow.\n\nMeteorologist Nick Petro of the NWS office in Raleigh said locations north of Interstate 85 and closer to the Virginia border could still see some pockets of snow, with perhaps another inch or two of snow accumulation.\n\nHowever, Petro said most of central North Carolina will see mostly sleet and/or freezing rain. He also said locations along and east of Interstate 95 south of Smithfield are likely to warm above freezing and change to rain later Friday afternoon and evening.\n\nPetro said a quick changeover from snow to sleet and freezing rain had been a possibility.\n\nPower outages widespread\n\nDuke Energy was reporting more than 14,000 customers without power in North Carolina on Friday afternoon. The utility’s outage map listed nearly 2,400 outages south of Interstate 40 and west of Interstate 26 in southwestern North Carolina, and almost 8,000 outages in the Lumberton area in the southeastern corner of the state.\n\nOther areas reporting outages include the Asheville area, the Triad and south of the Research Triangle area.\n\nHere are some tips from Duke Energy:\n\nCheck supplies of flashlights, batteries, bottled water, nonperishable foods, medicines, etc.\n\nEnsure a portable, battery-operated radio, TV or NOAA weather radio is on hand.\n\nDo not heat homes with a gas grill or bring a generator inside. Such equipment should be operated only outdoors, and only in well-ventilated areas. Manufacturer instructions should be followed.\n\nCheck on family members, friends and neighbors who have special medical needs or who are elderly, to ensure they have necessary emergency supplies.\n\nDetermine now what action they would take in the event of an extended power outage.\n\nDuke Energy customers in the Carolinas whose accounts have medical indicators to advise them of the pending severe weather have been notified to consider making alternative arrangements in the event of an extended power outage.\n\nCustomers who experience an outage during the storm should call the automated outage-reporting system at 1-800-POWERON (1-800-769-3766) or text OUT to 57801.\n\nCustomers can also report an outage or view current outages online at www.duke-energy.com/winterstorms.\n\nDuke Energy also will provide updates on its social media channels to keep customers informed if significant outages occur: www.twitter.com/DukeEnergy or www.facebook.com/DukeEnergy\n\nHere are some additional safety tips from Duke:\n\nStay away from power lines that have fallen or are sagging. Consider all power lines energized, as well as trees or limbs in contact with power lines. Please report downed power lines to Duke Energy. If a power line falls across a car you're in, stay in the car. If you MUST get out of the car due to a fire or other immediate life-threatening situation, do your best to jump clear of the car and land on both feet. Be sure no part of your body is touching the car when your feet touch the ground.\n\nHere are some safety tips from Mission Hospital:\n\nDo not leave the house without adequate clothing and protective wear. Be sure there is adequate fuel in any vehicle for prolonged travel and take blankets and charged cellphones. Remember, travel during this weather should be only when absolutely necessary.\n\nHypothermia occurs when body heat is lost faster than it can be produced, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Frostbite is an injury to body tissues caused by exposure to extreme cold, typically affecting the nose, fingers, or toes. Signs and symptoms of frostbite may include tingling, numbness, and changes in the color and texture of the skin. The hands and feet are most commonly affected by frostbite, but the nose, cheeks, shins, ears, and even the corneas of the eyes also may be affected by frostbite. Early signs of frostbite may be reversible, but in its most severe state frostbite can lead to loss of limbs and potentially death.\n\nWhen your body’s temperature drops, every vital organ system gradually becomes affected, including your heart, lungs, muscles and nervous system. Left untreated, these critically important organs begin failing, which can ultimately lead to death. Signs and symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, dizziness, hunger, nausea, fast breathing, and trouble speaking. Some symptoms of more severe hypothermia include confusion, lack of coordination, fatigue, and increased heart rate.\n\nSomeone with hypothermia may not be aware of his or her condition because the symptoms often begin gradually. Also, because hypothermia causes confusion it’s sometimes difficult for someone affected to recognize how severe their condition may be. This means it’s even more important during winter weather to closely monitor young children, elderly family members, friends and neighbors.\n\nSeek medical treatment immediately by calling 911 if you or someone you know is experiencing signs and symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite.\n\nSchool closings, delays\n\nWeather-related event, business cancellations\n\nHere are some tips for driving in inclement weather from the N.C. Highway Patrol:\n\nAvoid travel unless necessary when winter weather is in your area.\n\nDecrease speed.\n\nWear your seat belt.\n\nDriving considerations\n\nLeave early and allow more travel time; expect delays.\n\nIncrease distance between vehicles, as it takes significantly longer to stop on snow covered or icy roadways.\n\nClear all windows on your vehicle prior to travel; having unobstructed vision is vital to avoid running off of the road or having a collision.\n\nIlluminate your vehicle's headlamps.\n\nUse caution on bridges and overpasses as they are susceptible to freezing before roadways. Avoid using cruise control, which can cause the vehicle's wheels to continue turning on a slippery surface when speed needs to be decreased.\n\nBe prepared\n\nEnsure your vehicle has a full tank of gas in the event you are stranded for an extended period of time.\n\nCharge your cellular phone prior to departure.\n\nTake a blanket.\n\nNotify a family member or a friend of your travel plans prior to departure; if you travel is interrupted, someone will know.\n\nCollision information\n\nBe patient. Weather also limits our capabilities and increases our response time; also, keep in mind that the Highway Patrol will be experiencing a high volume of requests for service. Attempt to move your vehicle out of the roadway if you are involved in a minor, noninjury traffic collision, especially if you are in a dangerous area such as a curve or a blind hill. If your vehicle is stranded or wrecked but not in the roadway, attempts to recover your vehicle will have to wait until conditions improve for safety considerations.\n\nTo check the status of road conditions, motorists are asked to go to the Department of Transportation's website at www.ncdot.gov/travel.\n\nHere are some suggestions from the National Association of Home Builders and American Red Cross about home care:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/health/phage-superbug-killer-life-itself-wellness/index.html", "title": "Superbug crisis: How a woman saved her husband's life | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.\n\nAfter months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.\n\n“And I have this conversation that nobody ever wants to have with their loved one,” Strathdee told an audience recently at Life Itself, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“I said, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time.

First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope – fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.\n\nThen she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.\n\nNext, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.\n\nYet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body – and save his life.\n\nHer journey is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs – maybe even your own.\n\n“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year – that’s one person every three seconds – is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told the Life Itself audience.\n\n“We have been caught for the last 2 1/2 years in this terrible situation where viruses have been the bad guy,” she said. “I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”\n\nHow does a virus eat bacteria? 14:22 - Source: CNN\n\nA terrifying vacation\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.\n\nFound in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”\n\n“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”\n\nToday, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.\n\n“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee told Life Itself attendees. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”\n\nWith the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a psychiatry professor and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Tom was on a roller coaster – he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”\n\nPatterson's body was systemically infected with a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that also infected troops in the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname \"Iraqibacter.\" Steffanie Strathdee\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack\n\nAfter that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nA phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.\n\n“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion – that’s 10 to the power of 31 – phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”\n\nBuoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.\n\nOne stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’s been working with phages for nearly 45 years.\n\n“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”\n\n‘No problem’\n\nWhile the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.\n\nBut the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, ” ‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’ ” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”\n\nIn fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.\n\nDrs. Robert \"Chip\" Schooley (left) and Dr. Randy Taplitz after injecting Patterson with the first round of phages at UC San Diego Medical Center. Carly DeMento\n\nBack in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began – figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.\n\n“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”\n\nPurifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”\n\nMore hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’ ” Young said.\n\n“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.\n\n“It was like the parting of the Red Sea – all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”\n\n‘It was just miraculous’\n\nThe purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.\n\n“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”\n\nTwo days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.\n\n“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\n“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”\n\nPatterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nA legacy\n\nToday, more than six years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. The couple are back to traveling the world. But the long illness took its toll: Patterson was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage, no feeling in the bottoms of his feet and gut damage that affects his diet.\n\n“But we’re not complaining! I mean every day is a gift, right? People say, ‘Oh, my God, all the planets had to line up for this couple,’ and we know how lucky we are,” Strathdee said.\n\n“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” she added.\n\n“We feel like we need to tell our story so that other people can get this treatment more easily.”\n\nTo do so, the couple published a memoir: “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”\n\nStrathdee and Schooley have opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug resistant infections. And Schooley will soon start clinical trials using phages on a deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that attack patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\n\"The Perfect Predator\" is a blow-by-blow account by the couple of the fight to save Patterson's life. Hachette Books\n\nPatterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.\n\n“And there’s been many other labs that have joined in – Yale now has a phage therapy program, Baylor, Brussels … the Australians, Lyon, France, and more,” Strathdee told the Life Itself audience.\n\n“What we need next is a phage library,” she continued. “We don’t want to have to go from bog to bedside every time we need phages, right? We want to be able to go to a walk-in cooler and source phages that are characterized and cataloged and personalize them for patients.”\n\nStrathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference – and continue to search for a solution to the growing superbug crisis.\n\n“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’\n\n“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy – it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/business/india-wheat-export-ban-food-prices-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "India wheat export ban: Why it backtracked the offer to help fix the ...", "text": "New Delhi CNN Business —\n\nA month ago, as Russia’s war in Ukraine pushed the world to the brink of a food crisis, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi offered to help countries facing shortages.\n\n“We already have enough food for our people but our farmers seem to have made arrangements to feed the world,” Modi said in April. “We are ready to send the relief from tomorrow itself.”\n\nThe world’s second biggest producer of wheat after China was already walking the talk. In the 12 months to March, India cashed in on soaring global prices, exporting a record 7 million metric tons of the grain. That was up more than 250% on the previous year’s volumes. It had also set record export targets for the coming year.\n\nNow, those lofty goals have been abandoned and wheat exports banned as life-threatening heat waves in South Asia stunt output and push local prices to record highs.\n\nThe move shocked international markets on Monday — all the more since it came just days after India assured the world that the unprecedented heatwave wouldn’t impact its export plans. Global wheat prices spiked 6%, with futures trading in Chicago hitting $12.4 per bushel, the highest price in two months. Wheat futures dropped back a little Tuesday but are still up nearly 50% since the war started.\n\nWhile India is a huge wheat producer — even this year the country is expected to produce over 100 million metric tons — most of the grain is used to feed its population of 1.3 billion. By the government’s own admission, the country is “not among the top 10 wheat exporters.”\n\nBut the alarm its export ban caused underscores the fragility of global food supplies.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a historic shock to commodity markets that will keep global prices high through the end of 2024, the World Bank said last month. Food prices are expected to soar by 22.9% this year, driven by a 40% rise in wheat prices, it added.\n\nThat’s because Ukraine and Russia together account for about 14% of global wheat production, and about 29% of all wheat exports. Vital shipments of agricultural exports, including an estimated 20 million tons of grain, are stuck in Ukraine because Odessa and its other Black Sea ports have been blockaded by Russian forces.\n\nUkraine is among the top five global exporters for a variety of key agricultural products, including corn, wheat and barley, according to the US Department of Agriculture. It’s also the leading exporter of both sunflower oil and meal.\n\nBut the food situation was strained even before the fighting started in Europe. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n\nThe number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN’s World Food Programme said in March.\n\nA combine harvests wheat at a field on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India. REUTERS/Amit Dave Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nAfter Modi’s promise, many vulnerable countries were banking on supplies from India.\n\n“Indian wheat exports are especially important this year on the back of Russia-Ukraine crisis,” Oscar Tjakra, senior grains and oilseeds analyst at Rabobank, told CNN Business.\n\nThe “ban will reduce the availability of global wheat for exports in 2022 and will provide support to global wheat prices,” he added.\n\nNew Delhi’s policy U-turn on wheat has already been met with criticism from members of the G7, an organization of some of the world’s largest economies.\n\nOn Monday, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Representative to the United Nations, said that she hoped Indian authorities “would reconsider that position.”\n\n“We’re encouraging countries not to restrict exports because we think any restrictions on exports will exacerbate the food shortages,” she said at a press briefing in New York.\n\nRising food protectionism\n\nIndia has responded by maintaining that the curbs are essential for its own food security and also for keeping prices in check. Annual inflation in Asia’s third largest economy hit its highest level in nearly eight years in April, a development some traders say triggered the export ban.\n\nThe government also said that restrictions do not apply “in cases where prior commitments have been made by private traders,” and to countries that request supplies “to meet their food security needs.”\n\nAn Indian farmer carries wheat crop harvested from a field on the outskirts of Jammu, India, Thursday, April 28, 2022. Channi Anand/AP\n\nAccording to Tjakra, these exceptions should be considered “good news,” but they do make it harder to assess the impact the prohibition will have on global trade.\n\nThe “severity of impact” of the ban “will still depend on volumes of India wheat exports that are still allowed at the government level and volumes of wheat production from other global wheat producers,” he added.\n\nSome analysts in India say that allowing unrestricted exports was a bad idea in the first place.\n\n“We don’t know what will happen to the climate in India,” Devinder Sharma, an India-based agriculture policy expert, told CNN Business.\n\nIndia is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the impacts of the climate crisis, according to the UN’s climate change authority, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nIf crops are ruined because of unpredictable weather, India could run short of food, and be left “standing with a begging bowl,” Sharma added.\n\nIndia is not the only country looking inward and putting curbs on agricultural exports.\n\nIn April, Indonesia began restricting exports of palm oil, a common ingredient found in many of the world’s food, cosmetics and household items. It’s the world’s top producer of the product.\n\nJust a month earlier, Egypt had banned exports of key staples such as wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world’s most populous state.\n\n“With inflation already on the rise in Asia, risks are skewed towards more food protectionism, but these measures could end up exacerbating food price pressures globally,” Nomura analyst Sonal Varma said in a note on Saturday.\n\nShe added that the impact of India’s wheat export ban will “be felt disproportionately by low income developing countries.”\n\nBangladesh is India’s top wheat export destination, followed by Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Yemen, the Philippines and Nepal, Nomura said.", "authors": ["Diksha Madhok"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/11/foods-longest-shelf-life-expiration-date/39924813/", "title": "Foods with the longest shelf life: How long do these foods stay good?", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome foods have naturally long shelf lives, and if stored properly, will keep for months or years. Other foods spoil quickly, usually due to a high oil and/or moisture content, and will last a long time only if they’re dried, canned or otherwise preserved. There are numerous foods that spoil faster than you’d think.\n\nThere is great interest in long-lived foods among so-called preppers or survivalists, who anticipate having to live off the grid when widespread calamity strikes. Embracing the idea of lengthy self-sufficiency, they exchange tips on stockpiling particularly long-lasting foods.\n\nYou don’t have to be worried about doomsday, however, to see the advantages of stocking a pantry with things that will be good to eat for long periods of time. Unexpected guests, power failures and simply the kind of inertia that makes a trip to the market or going out to eat just too much of a project – these are all instances when anyone would be glad to have shelves stocked with the makings of a meal.\n\nFrom Charlottesville to Champaign:40 places young people are moving\n\nCurbing bad behavior, growing users:Why Twitter stock popped 20% in July\n\nMany kinds of food, including both fresh and dried produce, are known for their longevity. 24/7 Tempo has assembled a representative list of examples in many categories, including some that will last for weeks, and some that are virtually immortal.\n\nIn all cases, the estimated shelf life is for foods stored at room temperature or slightly cooler – not in the refrigerator or freezer, both of which will extend the lifespan of most items substantially. Evolving technology has brought many more options to the grocery store freezer, and there are a number of foods you couldn’t buy frozen 35 years ago.\n\nNote that moisture and high temperatures will shorten the lives of most foods, and that foods tend to change over time in color, texture, and/or flavor – so while they may last months or years, they may be at their prime somewhat earlier.\n\n1. Potatoes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 weeks\n\nIf stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Yukon Gold, red, and fingerling potatoes will last from two to three weeks. Larger white or russet potatoes can last for three to five weeks. Sweet potatoes have about the same shelf life. Don't store them next to onions, however: The two might go together well in cooking, but raw, each gives off gases and moisture that might cause the other to spoil faster.\n\n2. Onions\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nAs with potatoes, store these in a cool, dry, dark place for maximum longevity. And, as above, don't store them with potatoes; both will spoil faster.\n\n3. Peanuts\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 months\n\nPeanuts in their shell, especially when kept cool and dry, are perfectly happy in the pantry for as long as two months.\n\n4. Winter squash\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 3 months\n\nThe various kinds of thick-skinned winter squash – including butternut, spaghetti, acorn, kabocha, and hubbard, among others – are among the most durable of fresh vegetables.\n\n5. Apples\n\n• Shelf life: 5 days to 6 months\n\nApples kept in a fruit bowl at room temperature will generally last five to seven days. When stored in a humid place at a temperature of 30º to 40º F, however, they can stay crisp and fresh for as long as six months.\n\n6. Tea\n\n• Shelf life: 6 to 12 months past \"best by\" date\n\nDried tea leaves, whether loose (in a sealed container) or in teabags (in an unopened box) can easily last a year or more if they're not subjected to moisture or humidity. The tea does tend to lose flavor over time, though.\n\n7. Powdered milk\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 1½ years\n\nThe color, texture, or flavor of powdered milk might change as it ages, but it will still be perfectly usable and safe for at least 18 months.\n\n8. Beef jerky\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years\n\nBeef jerky and its predecessors in various parts of the world were invented to last a long time as sustenance in the wilderness and on long journeys. It's lean, dry, and salted – all qualities that add to its ability to stay edible for a long time.\n\n9. Canned fruits and vegetables\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nCanning is an extremely efficient means of preserving food. Generally speaking, if canned foods aren't subjected to intense heat, their contents should stay good for two years or more. Beware, however, of dented cans or those with swollen tops, which may indicate the presence of bacteria inside.\n\n10. Dried pasta\n\n• Shelf life: 1 to 2 years past \"best by\" date\n\nMade with just semolina flour and water, then thoroughly dried, this pasta is fairly indestructible. Its richer counterpart, fresh pasta, usually made with eggs, is much more perishable and should always be kept refrigerated.\n\n11. Bouillon cubes\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nOxygen and moisture are the enemies of these useful little blocks of instant soup or stock. Keep them dry and well sealed, and 24 months is probably the minimum they'll last.\n\n12. Peanut butter\n\n• Shelf life: 2 years\n\nAn unopened jar of peanut butter should last longer than a couple of years at room temperature, but with time, the oil will separate, the peanut butter might dry out, and the flavor may fade. Two years is likely the maximum for the best quality.\n\n13. Dark chocolate\n\n• Shelf life: 2 to 5 years\n\nBecause milk chocolate contains dairy, it will go bad more quickly than chocolate with high cacao content and little or no milk. Warm temperatures are the enemy of dark chocolate, and while it should last for a couple of years at temperatures up to around 75º F, it will keep for as long as five years if the thermometer rests between 60º and 65º F. Chocolate exposed to high temperatures can develop white spots, but these are harmless and don't affect the flavor.\n\n14. Canned or vacuum-pouched tuna\n\n• Shelf life: 3 to 5 years after \"best by\" date\n\nTuna is a hardy fish and one that takes well to canning (and in more recent times, to vacuum-packing in pouches). For optimum flavor and texture, don't keep it longer than five years after the producer's \"best by\" date.\n\n15. Dried beans\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nDried beans are pretty much indestructible if they're kept dry, though they begin to lose their moisture after a year or two. As they age, they will require longer pre-soaking and/or cooking times to become tender.\n\n16. Honey\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nThough honey is often sold with a \"best by\" date (usually somewhere between two and five years from the time it's packaged), that's because over time it may darken and form sugar crystals – perfectly harmless, but off-putting to some consumers. Pure 100% undiluted honey in an unopened jar (stored away from heat) will still be edible years, decades, probably generations down the road.\n\n17. Liquor\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nEverybody knows that wine can last a long time, sometimes greatly improving as it ages. But it can also go bad quickly through exposure to extreme heat or cold, oxidation through leaky corks, and just the natural evolution of its chemical constituents over time. Not so hard liquor. Unopened bottles of spirits are virtually unchanging. Their high alcohol content preserves them and they don't age. The only exception is with some sweet liqueurs, from which, as the years pass, some of the sugar content will precipitate out, forming crystals and leaving the liqueur slightly less sweet.\n\n18. White rice\n\n• Shelf life: Indefinite\n\nBrown rice might be healthier, but it has a high oil content and so can go bad in a few months' time, while white rice – if you keep it dry – will last forever. The only possible problem, other than moisture, is the sudden appearance of tiny black bugs among the rice grains. These are rice weevils or flour bugs, and they've either found their way into the package through microscopic openings or their eggs were harvested along with the rice itself. Storing rice in thoroughly dried airtight containers will stop them from getting in; if they're already there, though, the rice should be discarded.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

His victory makes him the first Black senator elected to a full six-year term in Georgia history.\n\nWhat it means: Warnock's win solidified a cycle in which Democrats defied history by defending every incumbent Senate seat, a first for the party in power since 1934.\n\nImpact for the Senate: A 51-49 majority will likely mean little in terms of policy goals given the Republicans took back the House, but it will be significant in terms of judicial appointments and other key confirmations for the next two years.\n\nA 51-49 majority will likely mean little in terms of policy goals given the Republicans took back the House, but it will be significant in terms of judicial appointments and other key confirmations for the next two years. High voter turnout broke fatigue talk.

The 10-point announcement Wednesday from the National Health Commission follows recent street protests in several cities over the strict “zero-COVID” policy now entering its fourth year, which has been blamed for upending ordinary life, travel and employment while dealing a harsh blow to the national economy.

The \"lack of a single, clearly identified person\" to lead the foods program has led to a culture of \"constant turmoil\" at the agency, the report found.

The area where an EF-2 tornado hit near Town Creek is too far away from warning sirens to have made a difference for the victims even if they went off, said Johnny Cantrell, director of the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down Dec. 16 south of Town Creek, went over a mountain and dipped down again before destroying everything in a path that was 370 yards wide at its maximum. A husband and wife died, and their 7-year-old son was among the injured. Town Creek Mayor Mike Parker said neither of the community’s two storm sirens emitted a warning before the killer tornado. Cantrell said the siren system is based on a concept that is decades-old, and he favors having a severe weather application for cellphones so residents in a storm’s path can be notified. He said he will continue to look at more modern notification systems and look for money to fund the application.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough has declared a local emergency from flooding brought on by an ice jam in Willow Creek. Borough Mayor Vern Halter in his declaration Monday night asked Gov. Mike Dunleavy to declare a state disaster for the affected areas. Halter cited severe threats to life and property, lack of access to homes and property damage loss. “The severity and magnitude of the flooding emergency is beyond the timely and effective response capability of the local resources,” he said. The ice jam Saturday night sent floodwater into nearby homes. At least 13 households were forced to evacuate, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Six were damaged by floodwater. Residents who chose to stay behind to tend to animals were cut off from leaving their neighborhood, KTUU-TV reported. Emergency workers on Monday used amphibious all-terrain vehicles and boats to shuttle people in and out so they could buy food, fuel and medications. There had been little change in the ice jam from Sunday to Monday, said borough emergency services director Ken Barkley. Ice jams have occurred during spring breakup but presented an unusual challenge in early winter, Barkley said. The temperature at 7 a.m. Tuesday in Willow was 6 degrees.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials said City Hall had been bugged for several months – with bedbugs, that is. The Arizona Daily Star reported officials said it took nearly three months to remove the small insects from the municipal building. The first report of bed bugs came in late September, with an employee reporting finding a dead bedbug in a file folder on the third floor. A week later, the second report surfaced with the sighting of a bedbug on the fourth floor. As a precaution, exterminators sprayed every floor of City Hall to get rid of the little bloodsuckers. Officials believe the bedbugs were brought in accidentally from an outside source. Tucson spokesman Andy Squire said after the three-month removal, the city also had to hire a Phoenix company earlier this month to bring in a specially trained dog to sniff the remaining bugs out. City officials estimated it cost about $7,853 to get rid of the infestation, with nearly half paying for the bedbug-sniffing dog.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An Arkansas fire chief has donated a kidney to a teenager he didn’t know. Maumelle Fire Chief Gerald Ezell told KATV that the surgery took place Dec. 13, two days after he met 18-year-old Sidney Burnett of Granby, Missouri. Ezell said he discovered Burnett was in need when he saw a Facebook post from her mother, an old school friend. He realized they had the same blood type. “I just felt like God was saying, ‘Hey, this is you,’” Ezell said. “Step across that line.” The transplant was performed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Burnett is still in Minnesota recovering from the surgery. “I was just so shocked that my donor was someone that had never even met me, but I’m so grateful for him,” she said. “He literally gave me my life back.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A study released this week has found that a law aimed at boosting vaccination rates across California had the greatest effect in high-risk areas where the vaccination rates were the lowest. The peer-reviewed study published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Monday showed that the 2016 legislation contributed to a 3.3% increase statewide for measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a 2.4% decrease in the number of requests for nonmedical or personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements. California adopted the strictest childhood vaccination laws in the nation after public health officials connected more than 100 measles cases to an outbreak at Disneyland that began in December 2014. The law requires children to be vaccinated to attend public or private schools. It allows for medical exemptions if there is a clear medical reason that children should not be vaccinated.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A fire that destroyed a historic building in a small mountain town in southwestern Colorado over the weekend led to power, internet and cellphone outages and took more than half of the town’s stored water to fight, officials said. The fire, which was reported about 10 p.m. Saturday, took nearly 17 hours to extinguish in subfreezing temperatures and used so much water that city officials asked residents of the small mountain town to voluntarily conserve water for a couple of days until storage tanks could refill, the Durango Herald reported Monday. Initially, “there was no way to get the word out,” to the town’s 400 residents, said John Sites, Silverton’s director of Public Works. Patrons at a brewery who spotted the fire were unable to use their cellphones to call 911 because of the outage. Fortunately, the brewery had a landline. The fire damaged a power line and CenturyLink line that run through the alley behind the gift and souvenir store that was destroyed, said San Juan County spokeswoman DeAnne Gallegos. Power was out for about six hours as outside temperatures dipped as low minus-10 degrees. Other wireless providers rely on CenturyLink’s line, so they were out of service as well. The fire was under control at 6 a.m., but Silverton’s fire crews continued to put out hot spots until 4 p.m. Sunday, said Gilbert Archuleta, chief of the Silverton-San Juan County Fire and Rescue Authority. The cause of the fire is unknown. Foul play is not suspected, Archuleta said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has been awarded a nearly $27 million federal grant to help further enhance early childhood development programs, the administration of Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The Preschool Development Birth through Five grant will help the state Office of Early Childhood design and launch better, more cost-effective systems to support family resilience and early childhood development. In addition to giving parents a greater voice, it focuses on developing and retaining the early childhood workforce. Connecticut was positioned to win the grant because the office is a national model integrating programs for young children and families, Commissioner Beth Bye said in a statement. Through a family-centered approach, the office serves thousands of children each year through child care, preschool, home visiting, health and safety assurance, early intervention, and parenting support. The three-year grant award starts Jan. 1.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Partially treated wastewater is being released from a treatment plant because of an equipment malfunction that state officials said cannot be immediately fixed. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control learned of the equipment malfunction at the Lewes wastewater treatment plant on Dec. 18, according to a press release Monday. Residents in the Lewes area are being asked to take water conservation measures until a resolution is announced, news outlets reported. Those measures include reducing shower time, avoiding multiple partial loads of laundry or dishwashing and minimizing “unnecessary flushing of toilets,” according to the release. DNREC said the plant has been bypassing stages of wastewater treatment since Dec. 19. Crews are screening the partially-treated wastewater effluent to remove visible solids, and a hydrogen peroxide feed is being used to reduce bacteria, state officials said. An emergency shellfish closure order has been issued by DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin for harvest areas downstream from the plant. The closure will continue for 21 days after the malfunction is fixed per U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two people were injured in a fire at a home for people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. D.C. Fire and first responders arrived at the scene early Monday and found three people were trapped inside, news outlets reported. Once rescued, two of those people were taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries not considered to be life-threatening. The third person declined medical treatment. Fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said most residents were alerted to the blaze by working fire alarms and were able to escape on their own. The fire’s cause still is under investigation. The D.C. mayor’s Office of Community Relations and Services and Red Cross are helping displaced residents, of which there are about 16. The home is part of the Oxford House network, which seeks to help residents with sobriety.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two more cases of dengue fever have been discovered in Miami-Dade County, bringing the total for the year to 14. The Miami Herald reported that it represents an uptick in reported cases of the mosquito-borne tropical disease. It continues to spread rapidly through Latin America, raising concerns that the number of cases in Miami will continue to rise. The Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County said the latest two cases are geographically linked to a travel-related case, but the department didn’t release additional details. Common symptoms of dengue virus include fever and one or more of the following: headache; eye pain; muscle, joint or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding such as nose and gum bleeds. The disease is spread through the bite of an Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same insect that also spreads the chikungunya and Zika viruses. According to the Florida Department of Health, Miami-Dade has had the most cases of locally transmitted dengue in the state this year, with only Broward and Hillsborough reporting other cases – one in each county.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp submitted twin plans requesting that President Donald Trump’s administration allow changes to federal government subsidies for health insurance. Kemp said proposed changes to former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would give individuals and families less expensive coverage options, a particular benefit for those who don’t qualify for federal subsidies to cover premiums. Critics said it would drive up insurance costs for older and sicker people. Kemp also wants to offer subsidized coverage to a fraction of Georgia’s uninsured poor if they worked or went to school for 80 or more hours a month. Kemp’s administration projects the expansion would cover 50,000 people, far less than the 400,000 uninsured Georgians who might be covered by the Medicaid expansion originally envisioned by the overhaul. This second proposal, aimed at people earning incomes of up to 100% of the federal poverty level, echoes those made by other states. Federal officials have rejected some similar partial expansions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Education won a federal grant of nearly $50 million for a long-term effort to enhance literacy among children, officials said. Education officials said the grant will be used to foster skills from infancy through high school, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy Grant spans five years and will focus on disadvantaged students, officials said. The state education department will begin seeking applicants in January for the effort that will use techniques grounded in data. The funds will supplement current instruction combined with other approaches known to be effective, from family education and engagement to ensuring educators at all levels have necessary tools and training, officials said. The $49.8 million grant will be divided among grade levels, with 40% to elementary schools, 40% to secondary schools and 15% to early education from birth to age 5. The remaining 5% at the state level will cover grant administration and program monitoring, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Environmental groups have written a letter to the U.S. Forest Service requesting more time for public comment on plans for Idaho’s Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. The coalition of a dozen environmental advocacy organizations sent a letter to the agency Monday asking for a 90-day extension because of interruptions caused by the holiday season, The Lewiston Tribune reported. The letter to Nez Perce-Clearwater Supervisor Cheryl Probert said the Dec. 20 release of the draft forest plan revision and environmental impact statement effectively removes about two weeks from the 90-day comment period. Even those with time to examine the document are not likely to be able to reach forest service employees during holiday break periods, the groups said. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest did not immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Tuesday. The two draft documents released by the forest service broadly describe the management of Nez Perce-Clearwater for the next 15 to 20 years. The documents are revisions of the individual Nez Perce and Clearwater forest plans that were last updated in 1987.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new study has found no evidence to corroborate that a beaver-skin stovepipe hat – for years a centerpiece of Illinois’ Abraham Lincoln museum – ever belonged to the 16th U.S. president, according to a published report. Among the findings spelled out in a 54-page report was that the hat, once appraised at $6.5 million, didn’t appear to be Lincoln’s size and that descendants of the original collectors weren’t aware of the claim Lincoln had owned it, WBEZ reported Tuesday, citing a copy of the study. The 16-month study also criticized a lack of due diligence to verify any link between the hat and Lincoln before it was purchased in 2007 and went on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. The hat was later purchased in 2007 by the private Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation from collector Louise Taper for display at the Springfield museum. It was the headliner in a wider Taper collection, for which the foundation paid around $25 million. The collection also included the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot. With secret doubts of their own, the private foundation sought to authenticate the hat over recent years, including a failed attempt to match DNA on the hat to Lincoln.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A group working to create a monument to the lead character in “Star Trek: Voyager,” Capt. Kathryn Janeway, has met its crowdfunding campaign goal of $12,500. The Captain Janeway Bloomington Collective will receive matching funds from the Indiana Housing & Community Development. That gives them enough to build it. Peter Kaczmarcyk and his wife, Mary Beth, have headed up efforts to create the monument this year. On May 23 – three days after Bloomington-native Janeway’s fictional birthday in the 24th century – a bust bearing the likeness of actress Kate Mulgrew will be unveiled in downtown Bloomington. Included in the design is a limestone base in the shape of the Starfleet insignia; and an informational table with information about the USS Voyager captain, series writer and producer Jeri Taylor and their local connections. Taylor is also a Bloomington native and earned her bachelor’s degree from Indiana University in 1959. Initially, the unveiling was planned for May 20, the character’s birthday, but Kaczmarczyk said so many people expressed interest in attending that they decided to move it to the weekend.\n\nIowa\n\nWashington: A former bricklayer made a deal with a retirement home that when he became a resident, it would to allow him to put up a display of model trains. Jim Bennett of Washington said the holiday season is his favorite time for the past 10 years because he gets to practice and display his enthusiasm for being a train engineer, KCRG-TV reported. His train display is in the lobby of the United Presbyterian Home in the town of 7,400 people about 50 miles south of Cedar Rapids. He has posted hours of operation so that visitors can see it for more than three hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Bennett said he will likely leave the display up through February. Bennett said he has always loved building toy trains, repairing them and watching them cruise around the tracks. But as he got older and moved into the retirement home, he worried he would not have a chance to ever bring out the sets again.\n\nKansas\n\nOsawatomie: Fire officials said a driver for the U.S. Postal Service “saved Christmas” after his delivery truck caught fire. The Wichita Eagle reported that firefighters in Osawatomie on Sunday posted photos on the volunteer department’s Facebook page of the smoldering and badly damaged engine compartment of the mail truck. The area of the driver’s seat also appeared to be damaged. But several packages, including Amazon Prime shipping boxes, were removed by the driver and placed in a ditch a safe distance from the burning vehicle. The driver’s name was not released. “Your Prime delivery may have just lost its Prime,” The Osawatomie Volunteer Fire Department said in the Facebook post. “The good news is, the driver saved Christmas!” Osawatomie is a town of 4,500 residents about 60 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Marian Group said Monday it has withdrawn from a development agreement to transform a site in Paristown that was home to the old Urban Government Center. Louisville chose The Marian Group in 2017 to develop the roughly 2-acre lot in Paristown Pointe at 814 Vine St. as the first part of a larger mixed-use development. The developer planned to build 22 modern shotgun homes on the vacant lot, angering some neighbors because it marked an increase from the 12 shotgun homes originally proposed. In a letter Monday to Louisville Forward, the city’s development branch, legal counsel for the developers wrote that the reason for withdrawing was the city’s failure to obtain rezoning, demolition permits and other waivers for the project, which it had to complete by Dec. 31. The development agreement called for the city, not the developer, to be responsible for those tasks. Caitlin Bowling, a spokeswoman for Louisville Forward, said the termination had been received and “we respect their decision.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nAbbeville:A Roman Catholic church decided to disperse some blessings to a local town via crop dusters. According to a Facebook post from the Diocese of Lafayette on Sunday, members of St. Anne Church on Cow Island called upon crop duster pilots to help spread their blessing to the community. The Rev. Matthew Barzare and parishioners of the church loaded 100 gallons of holy water into the planes, and the pilots sprayed the water onto the town and the nearby farms, KATC-TV reported. Parishioners also bought water from their homes to the airstrip to be blessed by Barzare. The idea came from L’Eryn Detraz, a Cow Island native who is a missionary stationed in Ohio. Cow Island is an unincorporated community in Vermilion Parish approximately 38 miles south of Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A University of Maine Cooperative Extension program that provides fresh produce for people in need has reached 3 million pounds of donations. Maine Harvest for the Hunger has existed since 2000 and donated more than 193,000 pounds of produce from more than 120 farms in the state this year. The donations went to more than 200 hunger-relief distribution sites, the university said. In nearly two decades in existence, Harvest for the Hunger has “mobilized Master Gardener Volunteers, home gardeners, farmers, businesses, schools, and civic groups to grow, glean, and donate quality produce to distribution sites (pantries, shelters, community meals) and directly to neighbors in need,” the university said in a statement. The value of the produce harvested this year was estimated at more than $300,000, the university said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Advanced Industrial Solutions, the United Kingdom’s largest provider of offshore wind industry training, will open a Salisbury facility in early 2020. The new training hub, created in partnership with Salisbury-based welding company ARCON, will begin hiring instructors in February or March, said ARCON President and CEO Katarina Ennerfelt. In total, the number of permanent new jobs at the training center in Northwood Industrial Park will likely be in the dozens, said Salisbury Mayor Jake Day. The safety training – which includes fire, first aid, material handling and working at heights – is required for technicians working on offshore wind projects and is regulated by an international standard under the Global Wind Organisation. As a whole, the renewable energy sector is expected to add 40,000 new jobs nationwide by 2030. Although the first trainees sent to the new facility will likely be training to work on offshore wind projects elsewhere across the U.S., the center will be available to train workers for wind projects set for the waters off Ocean City, Day said. ARCON has operated a welding services training center at its Northwood location since 2015.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined. The observation centers were part of a $5 million item in the state budget, which charges the public health department with promoting “harm reduction” to reduce the bad consequences of drug use.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A black rhino that is part of a critically endangered species delivered her first calf at a Lansing zoo, officials announced on Christmas Eve. The unnamed calf was born at Potter Park Zoo on Tuesday before 6 a.m. The 12-year-old mother, Doppsee, nuzzled her baby within minutes and the calf was standing up about 90 minutes later, according to the zoo. The calf, which is bonding with its mother, won’t be seen by the public until the spring of next year. Both animals will be monitored closely for the next few weeks. “This is a monumental moment for Potter Park Zoo that has taken our staff years of planning and hard work,” director Cynthia Wagner said. “We are dedicated to conserving rhinos and couldn’t be more excited about this successful black rhino birth.” Zoo officials said that the species is at risk of extinction because of illegal poaching and habitat loss. Dozens of sites are making conservation efforts, zoo officials said. The newborn’s father, Phineus, came to the zoo from Texas in 2017.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A light breeze and blue skies greeted a 30-by-60-foot American flag as it was unfurled for the first time Friday during a ceremony at Minnesota Truck Headquarters. The flag will fly atop a 150-foot flagpole, the largest dedicated flagpole in the state, according to general manager Rick Wildtraut. A tower at Millerbernd Manufacturing in Winsted is taller, but that light tower is used for other purposes for most of the year. A flag is flown on holidays and during the town’s festival and is not on daily display. In June, Ryan Electric built a 100-foot-tall flagpole at their offices in St. Cloud. The tallest flagpole in the U.S. is 400 at the Acuity Insurance company between Green Bay and Milwaukee.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: A scraggly metal Christmas tree planted in a pothole has inspired a minister to pen a holiday song. The Rev. Leon Hitchens of Webb Chapel Church in Liberty wrote “Pothole Christmas Tree” after local radio host Fern Crossley showed him the makeshift holiday scene, the Enterprise-Journal of McComb reported. The song celebrates John Drummond, who stuck the base of a wire Christmas tree into the traffic cone sticking out of the pothole. Neighbors decorated it with tinsel, ornaments and a large star on the top. An Associated Press account went worldwide, leading to additional coverage by Fox News. Drivers are now going out of their way to check out the pothole and its decoration. The city board said at last week’s meeting that crews are repairing poles as tight finances allow, and a $3.2 million bond issue dedicated to street paving might let the city fill others. Although many people take down their Christmas trees by New Year’s Day, it’s uncertain whether the city will have the pothole fixed by then.\n\nMissouri\n\nCalifornia: A mid-Missouri couple is donating more than 3,000 pairs of socks to homeless people as part of a program to honor their late son. The Columbia Missourian reported that Janet and Edward Miller of California started Gentle Ben’s Socks for the Homeless in memory of their son, Ben, who died of a brain aneurysm in 2017 at age 34. Janet Miller said socks are the most needed and least donated items for homeless people. The couple collected 900 pairs of socks in their first year. This year, the goal was 2,000 pairs, but they ended up with 3,100 pairs. The socks were donated at collection bins in California and Jefferson City. The socks will be donated to three Columbia organizations that help the homeless.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Warm temperatures and a lack of snow in the Kalispell area has led to the cancellation of a planned skijoring competition this weekend. Skijoring is a winter sport where skiers are pulled by horses through a course and over jumps. Organizers of Skijoring at Rebecca Farm said the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been canceled and would not be rescheduled. Last year’s planned event was postponed to March 2019, also because of a lack of snow. Then, the first day of the competition was canceled because of severe cold. Skijoring America lists eight other competitions this season, including five more in Montana and one each in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nNebraska\n\nEustis: A western Nebraska woman is known in her town as “The Santa Lady” because she has collected more than 9,000 items related to jolly old Saint Nick over 50-plus years. The North Platte Telegraph reported that Santa items fill both floors and every room, including the bathrooms, of Nancy Laier’s home in Eustis, a village of about 370 people about 165 miles west of Lincoln. She gives tours of her home – but asks that visitors call in advance to make sure she’s home. Laier said she began her collection sometime in the 1960s, when the first Pizza Hut restaurant came to North Platte, about 50 miles to the northwest. She said it had a drawing for a Santa doll; she entered her infant son, and he won. She said she found a lot of items when others threw them away.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Tire chains or vehicles with FWD/AWD with snow tires were required if people were trying to drive over Donner Summit on Interstate 80 or the Mt. Rose Highway on Wednesday morning, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. Chains were also required at Lake Tahoe on SR-28 from the Nevada/California state line in Crystal Bay to U.S. 50 near South Lake. Snowfall over Donner Summit on Tuesday night closed Interstate 80 because of several spinouts over the summit, but the road has reopened. The chain controls were later dropped for travel on Interstate 80.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State police helped to deliver a baby on Interstate 93 early Christmas morning. State police posted the news and a photo with the baby and parents at the hospital on social media Wednesday morning. State police Sgt. Vincent Grieco, Trooper Ryan St. Cyr and Boscawen Police Officer Ryan Nolan helped welcome baby Dominic into the world in Concord shortly after midnight, WMUR-TV reported. “All are happy, healthy and overjoyed to be spending Christmas together,” the state police post said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Thirteen bears were killed last week as the state concluded the second phase of its black bear hunt, according to wildlife officials. The hunt initially was scheduled for six days and ended Dec. 14, with 37 bears being culled overall. But it was extended for four more days because the harvest objectives for the year had not been met, and the hunt resumed Dec. 18. The state’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season will be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for the season stood at 14.7% when the decision to extend the hunt was made, marking the third straight year that the hunt has been prolonged. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters. Officials have said 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt, which took in place in October. Overall, 315 bruins were killed during this year’s hunts.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials are urging residents and visitors to spend some time outside on the first day of the year. The State Parks Division is holding a series of hikes at nine state parks on New Year’s Day as part of the annual First Day Hikes initiative. In addition to the hikes, visitors can also participate in Polar Bear Plunges at Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas and Eagle Nest Lake State Park in Eagle Nest. The participating parks range from Navajo Lake State Park in the northwest corner to Cerrillos Hills near Santa Fe and Pancho Villa and Leasburg Dam parks in southern New Mexico. At Elephant Butte, the dam is only open to pedestrian traffic one day a year for First Day Hikes. The New Year’s Day tradition happens nationwide. Last year, the National Association of State Park Directors reported that nearly 55,000 people rang in the New Year, collectively hiking more than 133,000 miles throughout the country on the guided hikes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city is expanding a program to use mobile units to reach hundreds of people who are mentally ill, the city announced Monday. The city said in a release that it will spend $9.4 million to boost its mobile mental health treatment teams, which were launched in 2016. The city said the new money will be part of a $21 million investment that will lead to the hiring of more social workers, housing specialists and legal assistance employees. The additional workers will be needed to process the 20% increase in mental health referrals the effort is expected to generate, the city said, adding that it will likely reach 900 more people annually. In addition, the city said it plans to spend $11 million to create hospital-based outreach teams to coordinate care for people who frequent emergency rooms and acute care facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student hailed by police as a hero for preventing more injuries and deaths after a gunman opened fire in a classroom has been immortalized as a Jedi by the production company for the Star Wars franchise. News outlets reported the family of Riley Howell, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte student who is described as a huge Star Wars fan, was tipped off by Lucasfilm in May that it planned to honor him in a forthcoming book, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - The Visual Dictionary.” Howell, 21, and a classmate died April 30 when a gunman opened fire in a classroom in the Kennedy building on UNCC’s campus. Four other students were injured, but police said Howell’s actions prevented more injuries or loss of life. The book was released by publisher DK to coincide with the release of the film “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The entry in the book is just 66 words, but credits Jedi master and historian “Ri-Lee Howell” with collecting “many of the earliest accounts of exploration and codifications of The Force.” Howell’s mother, Natalie Henry-Howell, told The Charlotte Observer this marks the second time her son has appeared in a “Star Wars” book: When he was younger, an uncle had a personalized book made for Riley that put him in the starring role of “The Phantom Menace.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters continued a 30-year tradition of delivering gifts to children at hospitals in Fargo on Christmas Day. KFGO-AM reported the tradition began in 1990 when the 3-year-old son of a Fargo firefighter was hospitalized and worried that Santa Claus would not be able to find him. The gifts this year are given in memory of Keaton Nelson, who made his Make-a-Wish be for gifts to be delivered to other hospitalized children. Nelson died from complications from Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles plans to begin a vehicle safety recall notification program using the state’s vehicle registration renewal process. Vehicle safety recall information will be printed on registration renewal notices sent through the mail, the bureau said in a news release. Customers will begin receiving open recall notifications beginning in January under the new program. Drivers who are not the original owners of a vehicle might not be aware of an open recall, officials said. An open recall will not interfere with a Ohioans’ ability to renew their vehicle registration, according to the bureau. BMV customers are advised to check their Vehicle Identification Numbers for open recalls by using the VIN look-up tool on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. They also can contact their authorized dealer.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s top adviser on tribal issues announced her resignation on Monday and accused the governor of creating an ‘unnecessary conflict’ with the tribes over casino gambling. Lisa Billy, a former Republican lawmaker and Stitt’s secretary of Native American Affairs, said in her resignation letter that Stitt’s position on the compacts poses a threat to the state’s economy and its relationship with the tribes. Stitt said in a statement he was grateful for Billy’s service and he remains committed to working collaboratively with the tribes. `The governor caught many tribal leaders off guard last summer when he announced in a newspaper editorial that he wanted to renegotiate the compacts. The sides have been locked in a dispute ever since about whether the compacts expire on Jan. 1. Stitt claims they do, but the tribes maintain triggers have been met for the compacts to automatically renew.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Salem and Brooks vegetable processing plants owned by bankrupt NORPAC Foods could soon reopen after Lineage Logistics filed to purchase the company’s Oregon properties for $49 million, according to court records. The Statesman-Journal reported that a bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the petition for the proposed sale Jan. 14 in bankruptcy court in Portland. The sale would include NORPAC’s Willamette Valley processing facilities in Salem, Brooks and Stayton, along with the field shop in Quincy, Washington. NORPAC attorney Al Kennedy said in court that Lineage Logistics will lease the plants in Salem and Brooks from NORPAC until the sale is completed. And Lineage would lease those to Oregon Potato Company to operate until the sale is done, which would allow some of the 1,400 NORPAC workers who had been notified they could be laid off to continue to work. Lineage Logistics, which was formed in 2008, is one of the largest cold storage companies in the world, including operating 169 cold storage warehouses in the United States and more in countries such as China and the United Kingdom.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Thousands turned out Wednesday to watch the annual reenactment of George Washington’s daring Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware River in 1776 – the first time the crossing was completed in three years. The event was scrapped because of bad weather the last two years, but historical interpreter Nancy O’Leary said at Washington Crossing Historical Park that the conditions this year “couldn’t be better.” Jennifer Martin, executive director of the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. estimated that 4,500 to 5,000 people were watching the event, the highlight of a historical reenactment that draws people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey. Other activities included Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers returning to the State House after the holidays will notice some subtle changes to the House and Senate chambers. When lawmakers return in January, they will see new shades of paint on the walls, feel thicker carpet under their feet, sit at revarnished desks, brush past brighter drapes and listen to each other’s speeches on new audio speakers, according to The Providence Journal. In addition, the cracked skylight above the House Speaker’s desk has been repaired as has the domed roof above the Senate chamber, which often leaked when it rained. It was the first significant chamber renovation since the General Assembly downsized in 2003 from 150 seats to the current 113. That renovation also brought computers to lawmakers’ desks for the first time.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: A Charleston-area landmark will be lit up for the holidays. The Post and Courier reportsed that Dominion Energy and a group dedicated to saving the Morris Island Lighthouse will illuminate the lighthouse from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. The lighthouse also was illuminated on Christmas Day. Dominion spokesperson Persida Montanez said engineers will use 12-volt batteries, LED lights and a solar panel to provide light. The lighthouse was constructed in 1876, but has faced severe erosion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Area schools and two radio stations raised more than $14,000 to give gift cards to students who don’t have a permanent address this year. In all, the Rapid City Journal reported Tuesday that 573 students will each receive $25 Visa gift cards. The radio stations that helped in the effort were 97.9 the Breeze and KLMP. It was part of a campaign called “Hope for the Homeless.” During the four years the schools and radio stations collaborated on the effort, they haved raised nearly $45,000 for gifts to homeless middle and high school students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee’s county health department clinics are offering flu vaccines at no charge. Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey encouraged anyone who has not received a flu shot this season to get one as soon as possible. The state Health Department suggested contacting local health departments for information. Information about nearby departments is available online. Free flu vaccines are also available at the Shelby County Health Department in Memphis and the Metro Public Health Department in Nashville, in addition to health departments run by the state throughout Tennessee, the state said. Even after being vaccinated, the state Health Department recommends washing hands with soapy water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and covering coughs and sneezes with a sleeve or tissue to help prevent the spread of illness. People who are sick should stay home so they can recover and avoid infecting others.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A resident who was diagnosed with measles is no longer a health threat, but officials are urging some people to get medical attention if they develop a fever before New Year’s Day. Public health officials made the plea to anyone who visited specific Austin locations that the affected resident was in between Dec. 14 and Dec. 17. The Austin American-Statesman created a map of those locations. The resident is currently not in Texas. Measles is a virus that can cause high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms, but other complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. Health officials first alerted people in Austin about the measles case and potential exposure on Sunday, a day after state agencies were informed by Virginia officials, said Dr. Mark Escott, the interim health authority at Austin Public Health. The person traveled to Virginia on Dec. 17. The person, whom officials are not identifying, contracted the disease while traveling in Europe from late November to early December and became sick on Dec. 14, Escott said. He noted that the person developed a rash on Dec. 17, which is the day they boarded United Airlines Flight 790 from Austin to Chicago, with a connecting flight to Virginia. The person’s measles case is the first reported in Travis County since 1999, the Statesman reported. Officials didn’t disclose if the person was vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nBrighton: A second ski resort near Salt Lake City is changing its parking policy to favor carpooling amid concerns about traffic congestion in a canyon home to popular ski resorts. Starting Wednesday, Brighton Resort designated prime parking areas for visitors with three people or more in their cars on holidays like Christmas that are often popular days to ski, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Officials said the policy applies to weekends, holidays and powder days. It could encourage more people to share cars or take public transportation on days when cars full of skiers can lead to long lines of traffic snaking through the snow-covered mountains. Single drivers or those with one passenger must park at a further lot, where a shuttle service will ferry them to the lifts. When that lot near the resort store is full, people will be asked to turn around and park along the road, or return to the mouth of the canyon and take public transit. The move comes after neighboring Solitude Mountain Resort, also in Big Cottonwood Canyon, made the unusual move to start charging noncarpooling guests $20 to park. The price drops to $10 if the car has three occupants and $5 for four or more people. Park staffers have said their goal isn’t to make money but rather to ease traffic gridlock. Season pass holders at both Brighton and Solitude can ride free on the canyon bus routes offered by the Utah Transit Authority.\n\nVermont\n\nJericho: The Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho will get $30 million in federal funding for a new facility, the Vermont National Guard announced this week. The funding is part of the defense budget signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Groundbreaking is likely to happen late next year, the Guard said. Members of the school provided mountain warfare and cold-weather training to U.S. and Afghan conventional operations forces on deployments in 2005 and 2010, the Guard said. Instructors served as experts on mountain warfare in Afghanistan. The $30 million appropriation will support “a critically important but previously unfunded priority of the Army,” said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy in a written statement on Monday. The design of the 82,600-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility will start as early as January, said Michael Bleau, deputy construction and facilities management officer. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2022, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRaven: A company that owns a coal mine has furloughed 600 workers until the end of the year. The reported reason behind the move is the trade war between the U.S. and China. The Bristol Herald Courier reported Monday that Coronado Coal idled its mining facility in Buchanan County on Dec. 16. Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, said the company cited the trade war between China and the U.S. as a reason for the furlough. But she said the company also plans to bring the mine back into full production by Jan. 1. Coronado did not specify what it was looking for between China and the U.S. But tensions appeared to ease earlier this month with the announcement of a “Phase One” trade deal. China has agreed to buy an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services. That agreement is expected to be signed in January. The idling of the mine in Buchanan County caps a tumultuous year for southwest Virginia’s coal industry. The region also saw the bankruptcy of Blackjewel LLC. The firm employed more than 480 people in the state.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police is asking for the public’s help to find the person or people who killed three cow elks and left them to waste in North Bend. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that police said in a Facebook post that three cow elks were found the weekend of Dec. 14 shot with archery equipment and left to die in the area behind Ken’s Truck Town Diner in North Bend. Two of the elks were found with matching arrows, and the third was found with a different type of arrow and broad head. Police said that those who provide information leading to an arrest might be eligible for a cash reward or bonus points for special permit hunting opportunities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Eligible employees at Mon Health System will soon be offered 14 straight days of paid parental leave. Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg announced in a news release that the new policy will take effect at the start of the new year. WBOY-TV reported that if both spouses or partners are employed by Mon Health, each will be afforded the same benefit. Mon Health also operates Mon Health Preston Memorial Hospital and Mon Health Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospital. Congress passed a bill earlier this month giving the country’s 2.1 million government employees 12 weeks of paid parental leave as part of a defense bill that President Donald Trump signed into law. But it still leaves about 80% of U.S. workers in the private sector with no access to paid family leave. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that lacks a federal policy, at least for new mothers, leaving employers to decide whether to offer it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nRib Mountain: The Salvation Army in Wausau said it got to 80% of its $170,000 Red Kettle fundraising goal before the holiday campaign ended on Christmas Eve. The organization told WSAW-TV donations have dropped in recent years and a lack of volunteers is one of the factors. Lt. Donna Thammavongsa with Wausau’s Salvation Army said another reason for falling short is that people don’t carry as much cash anymore. The Red Kettle campaign is more than 100 years old. It’s the Salvation Army’s largest annual fundraiser.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: No evidence links hydraulic fracturing to contaminated groundwater in central Wyoming, according to a state Department of Environmental Quality report. The contamination near Pavillion likely occurred naturally because of permeable geology in the gas-drilling area, the report released Monday found. However, absence of data from before drilling began in the mid-1900s limits scientists trying to determine the exact source of the contamination, the report stated. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation began in 2008 and led to draft findings in 2011 that theorized a link between the contamination and nearby hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process uses pressurized water, mixed with sand and chemicals, to split open underground deposits and boost oil and gas production. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry cautioned residents not to drink the water. The EPA, however, didn’t complete its report and handed the investigation over to state officials. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced in 2013 it would conduct a thorough study of the 12-square-mile Pavillion gas field with help from $1. million from Encana Oil and Gas USA, Inc., the Canadian-based company operating the site, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Several environmental groups and landowners expressed skepticism about the additional research.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/26"}]}

Now, over a month later, Toyota has not yet identified the issue and is offering to simply buy back the SUVs from customers who no longer want to wait for the problem to be resolved.\n\nBecause the issue became evident soon after the SUVs went on sale, there are only about 260 BZ4X owners in the United States facing this situation. There are more who had ordered the SUV but not yet had it delivered when the “Do not drive” warning was announced. Those customers have never been able to accept delivery of their SUVs.\n\nThe automaker has offered a number of options beyond the buyback while it asks the owners for their patience. Toyota is also offering customers the free use of another Toyota vehicle until the issue is found and corrected. Toyota is also offering owners $5,000 toward their car payments or as a partial refund of the purchase price. Toyota will also extend the vehicles’ factory warranty by the amount of time — whatever it ends up being — that the SUVs have been taken out of service.\n\nFor the customers who simply want to sell their vehicles back, the exact terms of the repurchase may vary depending on various state regulations and specifics of the owner’s situation.\n\nThe BZ4X is nearly identical to the Subaru Solterra electric SUV. The two Japanese automakers developed the vehicles jointly. Subaru did not have to recall any SUVs in the United States, though, because none had been delivered before the problem was discovered.\n\nToyota is not the first automaker to recall electric vehicles in recent years. General Motors offered to buy back Chevrolet Bolt EVs following reports of battery fires. That case involved potentially many more vehicles than the relative of handful of BZ4Xes, but Bolt owners were able to, at least, continue using their vehicles with certain restrictions. GM eventually discovered the source problem and is now able to replace batteries in vehicles that needed them.

The announcement comes about 18 months after the company had warned, in a regulatory filing, that it could go out of business and, shortly thereafter, the CEO and Chief Financial Officer both resigned.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday that it is now ready to start delivering its full-sized electric pickup, the Lordstown Endurance, to customers. The first few of what the company said will be an “initial batch” of 500 trucks has left the factory. The identity of the first customers to get the trucks, which will be fleet owners, will be announced later, Lordstown spokesperson Colleen Robar said in an email. The company had previously said the truck would go into production by the end of 2021.\n\nLordstown’s strategy has always been to build and sell electric pickup trucks for commercial fleet customers rather than competing against automakers like General Motors and Ford (F) in the consumer market. Of course, those companies, which sell the most pickups in America, also compete heavily in the commercial fleet market. Ford (F), in particular, has already seen great success with its own electric truck, the F-150 Lightning. Ford (F) has already delivered about 12,000 of its electric trucks, which went into production earlier this year.\n\nSo, simply getting trucks to production does not ensure Lordstown Motors’ success, but it’s a milestone that, not that long ago, it seemed the company might never reach.\n\nLordstown Motors went public in a SPAC deal announced in 2021. The company later disclosed it was under investigation by the both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice regarding the SPAC deal and its reporting of truck orders. The company said at the time it was cooperating with the investigations.\n\nThe Lordstown, Ohio, factory in which these trucks were built was once owned by GM, which built compact cars there. GM sold the factory to the electric pickup startup in 2019. In 2021, Lordstown entered into an agreement with Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturing company best known for working with Apple to build its iPhones. Under that arrangement, which was formally completed earlier this year, Foxconn purchased the factory and, at the same time, agreed to help build the Lordstown Endurance truck there. Lordstown also plans to build electric vehicles for other EV startup companies there including Fisker.\n\nLordstown Motors has said that it will gradually ramp up production of the trucks as the company deals with supply chain challenges.\n\nThe Endurance is a four-wheel-drive truck with four electric motors, one inside each wheel. The company has said the trucks will be able to produce up to 550 horsepower and tow up to 8,000 pounds. Prices for the truck start at around $65,000.\n\nCar and Driver, in a review of the truck, wrote that, while it “might make sense for fleet customers” it offered few features and not as much driving range – only 200 miles – as ordinary truck buyers might expect. The least expensive version of the F-150 Lightning, with a starting price around $47,000, can go 240 miles on a full charge. The Endurance also doesn’t perform as well, tow as much or ride as nicely as other electric pickups, according to Car and Driver. A Lordstown Motors spokesperson declined to comment on the review. The truck is also a finalist for the North American Truck of the Year award, an award given that is voted on by a jury of about 50 auto journalists from a variety of media outlets.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/business/tesla-recall-seat-belt-reminder-alert/index.html", "title": "Tesla recalls 817,000 vehicles due to seat belt alert issue | CNN ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN Business —\n\nTesla has issued a second recall in a week’s time, in this case due to a chime that would not always sound if a driver’s seat belt was unbuckled.\n\nThe faulty seat belt chime impacted 817,143 vehicles, including Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicle from the 2021 and 2022 model year.\n\nTesla has already begun introducing a software update to fix the issue in production vehicles, according to a document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Other Tesla vehicles will receive an over-the-air software update early this month.\n\nThe Tesla recalls that have surfaced in the last week are not burdensome for vehicle owners, or the company. Drivers do not need to schedule a service appointment. Both are being fixed through software updates, which lessens the severity and cost of a recall. (Earlier this week Tesla recalled its “full self-driving” software, which had been programmed to roll through stop signs.)\n\nFederal safety standards require that an audible seat belt reminder chimes after a vehicle is started if the driver seat belt is not detected as buckled.\n\nThis seat belt chime was not sounding on some Teslas due to a software bug, according to the document the automaker filed.\n\nThe bug occurred after a driver had exited the vehicle when the chime was sounding, and then re-entered the vehicle. The issue would not occur if the vehicle exceeded 13.7 mph, according to Tesla. The automaker’s visual alert of an unbuckled seatbelt was also unimpaired by the flaw, the document said.\n\nThe South Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute notified Tesla of the issue on January 6 of this year.

Quality problems with that launch cost the company billions and played a big role in the departure of two executives.\n\n“There’s a lot riding on it,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive. “Ford has had its troubles with launches and now added to that there are all of these supply chain issues.”\n\nVirtually all automakers have had to scale back production of new vehicles due to a shortage of computer chips and other parts and materials, often temporarily shutting factories. Those production bottlenecks have led to limited supply of vehicles, which in turn has resulted in record high car prices for consumers.\n\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of the company’s founder and the executive chairman of the automaker, compared the importance of the F-150 Lightning to the most important vehicle in the company’s history.\n\n“The Model T over 100 years ago brought cars to everybody. Well, this vehicle will bring electric vehicles, particularly electric trucks, to everybody,” he told CNN’s Richard Quest Tuesday.\n\nKrebs said she think that’s overstating the importance of the Lightning, but she agreed it is a breakthrough vehicle for the shift to electric vehicles on which Ford and other automakers are betting tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe Lightning is not the first electric pickup to hit the market. Upstart Rivian, which makes nothing but electric vehicles, started production of its R1T pickup last fall, but has built only about 3,500 in its first six months of production. And General Motors has started production of the GMC Hummer EV pickup, but has sold only 99 of them in the first quarter of production.\n\nThe F-150 Lightning has beat both the Tesla Cybertruck and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, two of its main competitors, to market by a year or more.\n\nAnd if Ford (F) and major automakers in the US market are going to succeed in transitioning from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric, as they say they intend to, they’re going to have to get American truck buyers comfortable with the idea of electric pickups, Krebs said.\n\n“It’s really going to test the waters. Is there a market for electric pickups? How big it is?” Krebs said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/business/schumer-manchin-bill-ev-credits/index.html", "title": "Tesla, GM buyers would get EV tax credits again under Democrats ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUnder a new green energy bill agreed to by Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin, automakers like Tesla and General Motors would regain the ability to offer federal tax credits to customers who buy their electric vehicles.\n\nHurdles to the bill’s passage remain, but if it becomes law it could cut the price of electric cars for many Americans, which are relatively more expensive than gasoline vehicles, by reviving tax credits for some manufacturers’ vehicles and introducing a new one as well.\n\nUnder current regulations, buyers of electric vehicles get a $7,500 tax credit when purchasing an electric vehicle, but that full credit is limited to the first 200,000 electric vehicles sold by any given manufacturer. After that, the tax credit amount is reduced over the subsequent year and finally phased out altogether. The tax credits, and the cap on sales, also apply to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nThe proposed legislation would remove the 200,000 vehicle-per-manufacturer cap, in a win for some of the biggest names in the EV market. Automakers like Tesla and GM that have already sold more than 200,000 electric cars can no longer offer the tax credits, essentially raising the price of their vehicles compared to competitors. Other automakers are close to losing access to the credits, too. Toyota, for instance, can currently only offer reduced tax credits.\n\n“We remain hopeful that Congress will advance legislation to address energy and economic security that includes a modification to the EV tax credit removing the per-[automaker] cap,” said GM spokesman Matt Ybarra. “We will review the draft text and look forward to working with Congress on these provisions that would ensure a level playing field for all [automakers].”\n\nThe proposed legislation would put more limits on the vehicles that qualify for the credits, though. For instance, there are requirements for the vehicles and batteries to be manufactured, at least in large part, in North America. At least 50% of the battery components must be made in North America, which rises 10% a year to 100% of battery components by 2029.\n\nAlso, there are limits on income for buyers to quality for the tax credits. They can have taxable income of no more than $300,000 annually for those filing jointly, or $150,000 for those filing as individuals.\n\nAlso, there are price caps on the vehicles that will qualify. For plug-in trucks, vans and SUVs, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price must be no more than $80,000; for all other types of vehicles, like sedans and sports cars, the price limit would be $55,000.\n\nRules that distinguish between different vehicles types, for purposes of Environmental Protection Agency regulations, can be somewhat opaque, however. This allows automakers to make vehicles that may appear similar to a wagon but actually qualify legally as SUVs. The Subaru Outback, for instance qualifies as an SUV thanks, in part, to its higher-than-ordinary ride height, despite its perception among some as a wagon. The Honda HR-V and Nissan Rogue Sport, on the other hand, are classified by the EPA as compact wagons. The bill calls for the creation of rules that would be similar to those used by the EPA.\n\nOne of the most important changes, though, is that EV buyers wouldn’t have to wait until they file their taxes to get the tax credit, said Sam Abuelsamid, an electric vehicle analyst with Guidehouse Insights. Instead, the incentive would be treated like a rebate and applied at the time of purchase at the dealer, he said.\n\n“By taking it off the top, you can actually lower your monthly payment,” he said.\n\nThe bill also includes a tax credit for the purchase of a used electric vehicle. Currently, tax credits are only offered for a new EV, something that critics have argued favors the wealthy who can afford expensive brand new vehicles. Under the bill, buyers of previously-owned electric vehicles would be eligible for a $4,000 credit or 30% off the cost of the vehicle, whichever is less. But there are caveats here, too. Used EVs can only cost a maximum of $25,000 to qualify for a tax credit, and only if it’s sold by a licensed car dealer; it must also be the first time the car has been re-sold.\n\nThese new tax credit rules, if passed into law, would expire in 2032.\n\nToyota and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new legislation.

Tesla owners won’t need to take their vehicles to a service station.\n\nTesla has issued seven recalls this year for the 2022 Model 3 and six for the 2022 Model Y, all of which have been addressed with over-the-air software updates. Cars, especially electric vehicles, increasingly rely on computers to function, so software fixes are likely to become more common. The fixes may also be much less expensive to make compared to procuring and installing physical parts like new airbags or engine components.\n\nThe recall issued this month includes Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys from 2022 as well as Model Ss and Model Xs from 2021 and 2022 that are running certain versions of Tesla’s operating system. A computer chip in the infotainment system in these Teslas may not cool sufficiently, leading to slow processing or a restart. The infotainment system may lag or appear blank. Tesla owners rely on the infotainment system for many features, including navigation, music, heat and air conditioning, adjusting windshield wiper speed and viewing the back-up camera.\n\nTesla said in a public filing to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it had identified 59 warranty claims and reports of the issue. It initially fixed the issue in some vehicles this January by replacing the computer chip in affected infotainment systems. By April it had developed a software update to address the issue.\n\nTesla said it id not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related this condition.\n\nA single traditional recall, in which impacted owners must bring the vehicle in for service, could financially cripple an automaker, which has to pay for the labor and parts to complete fixes. General Motors spent $4.1 billion on recalls in 2015 for problems like faulty ignition switches.\n\nRecall completion rates are much higher for software updates than traditional recalls, which is a safety benefit.

Until September, the chain is selling Chocolate BonBites, which are bite-sized chocolate rolls that Cinnabon describes as a “chocolatey take” on its miniature sized cinnamon rolls.\n\nAvailable in four-count and 16-count packs, the treats are baked with sweet dough, layered with chocolate schmear and topped with both chocolate and cream cheese frosting. Prices for the limited-time offering begins at $4.79 for the four-count pack.\n\nChocolate BonBites are on sale until September. Cinnabon\n\n“It’s something familiar to our guests, where we have our legendary dough and what we do really well. Now we’re adding that chocolate twist to it,” said Tracey Young, Cinnabon’s chief brand officer, in an interview with CNN Business. “We’re really excited about bringing — after 35 years — a chocolate product to our lineup.”\n\nChocolate has long been on Cinnabon’s radar, with Young saying the flavor “always scores high, but even higher now,” prompting them to explore a chocolate-centric product. It already exists on the menu in some drinks and in Cookie BonBites, a treat that combines cinnamon rolls and chocolate chip cookies.\n\n“When people come to us, they tend to be wanting to get that indulgent thing we’re known for,” Young said nodding to cinnamon. “Now that as chocolate has become a little bit more relevant and forward with our guests, this is the best opportunity to introduce an limited time offering.”\n\nAs for settling on the new product, the chain has found success with it overseas.\n\nA version of Chocolate BonBites has been sold at Cinnabon’s international locations in over 20 countries, including in Spain, India and the United Kingdom for the past few years. However, the US version includes chocolate frosting, which the international product doesn’t.\n\nChocolate BonBites could become a permanent addition to its menu if customers enjoy it, Young said.

But producing them is not easy.\n\n“Whole-muscle products are challenging to mimic because of their fibrous textures and integrated pockets of fat,” explains Karen Formanski, of the Good Food Institute.\n\nWith its plant-based prime cut steak, Juicy Marbles thinks it’s mastered the art. The Slovenian company’s filet mignon contains many ingredients used widely in plant-based beef — soy protein concentrate, sunflower oil, beetroot powder and yeast extract, for example — but it claims to be distinct from other brands because of its marbling effect of protein and fat.\n\nThe production process involves nothing “more complex than heating and cooling,” says co-founder and chief brand officer Vladimir Mićković. He declined to reveal any more details.\n\nFilets for all tastes\n\nBased in Domžale, close to the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, the company was founded in 2019 by Luka Sinček, Maj Hrovat, Tilen Travnik and Mićković, by profession a microbiologist, a biotechnologist, an app developer and a restauranteur and brand developer respectively.\n\nSinček and Hrovat migrated from “building little bioreactors in Nutella jars and playing with proteins” in dorm rooms, says Mićković, to engineering a process that went some way to replicating the complex textures of meat.\n\nThe company has raised $4.6 million and its filet mignon was launched online in Europe and the United States earlier this year. Retailing for €30 ($30) for a pack of four 113g (4oz) filets, they’re not cheap, but have been bought by customers to cook at home, as well as restaurants looking for something that goes beyond plant-based burgers or sausages, says Mićković. It plans to begin selling in shops in the European Union, United States and United Kingdom in 2023.\n\nA cross section of a cooked Juicy Marbles filet mignon. It has been sold online to both the general public and restaurants. courtesy Juicy Marbles\n\nThe company first experimented with plant-based chicken breast and a rudimentary pork rib too, but now focuses on beef, says Mićković, “the most environmentally devastating product with the biggest (carbon) footprint.”\n\nCattle emit large quantities of potent greenhouse gas methane, and livestock consumes more than three quarters of the world’s soy — a crop linked to deforestation. Just 7% of the world’s soy — the main ingredient of Juicy Marbles’ product — is directly consumed by humans.\n\nPlenty of other companies are selling whole cuts of plant-based beef. Japan’s Next Meats sells a skirt steak and short-rib while Meati Foods in the United States, Chunk Foods in Israel, Novameat in Spain and Meatless Farms in the United Kingdom all produce their own takes on beef steaks.\n\nIndustry headwinds\n\nA ribeye created by Juicy Marbles. The company says it has created versions of a number of beef cuts, including sirloin. courtesy Juicy Marbles\n\nHowever, the plant-based meat industry is having a tough time. Shares of Beyond Meat (BYND) are down more than 75% this year, near an all-time low. A recent report from Deloitte said sales of plant-based meat were “stagnating” in the United States, citing inflation, consumers questioning the assumed benefits of plant-based alternatives and the possibility that the number of repeat buyers “may already have reached a saturation point.”\n\n“The main challenge for the whole cuts subsegment is that volumes are still so low that you aren’t getting economies of scale,” says Malte Clausen, co-author of a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group on alternative proteins.\n\n“As prices for input crops are increasing, that is likely to be a particular challenge for low-volume production lines. So even though plant-based required less inputs than animal-based, on the very short term it is still a challenge to reap the benefits.”\n\nMićković says he doesn’t want Juicy Marbles to be an “inaccessible premium product company,” and in November it will begin selling a tenderloin designed to feed the whole family. The price is yet to be announced.\n\n“It’s going to be the strangest piece of plant-meat out there,” he says.\n\nAchieving scale will help lower prices for the manufacturer and consumers and expand the product’s reach, Mićković believes. “This can be cheaper than animal meat, and it will be, eventually.”", "authors": ["Tom Page"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/beyond-meat-sales/index.html", "title": "What's gone wrong at Beyond Meat | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA slew of problems have stalled the growth of Beyond Meat, once a darling of Wall Street whose top product became synonymous with plant-based burgers.\n\nSales have been declining, sliding 22.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, and the company has laid off over 20% of its global staff since August. After an extremely successful market debut in 2019, Beyond Meat (BYND) has lost favor with investors. The stock dropped about 77% so far this year.\n\nSome of the problems can be attributed to broader industry challenges. In the grocery store, interest in plant-based meats has waned as consumers, faced with inflation, focus on shopping for affordable basics.\n\nAt the same time, restaurant traffic is dipping. Cash-strapped customers are pulling back on dining out, making Beyond’s foodservice business more vulnerable. And Beyond is far from the only company to lay off staff as a possible recession looms.\n\nBeyond Meat's sales fell in the third quarter. Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images\n\nBut Beyond is facing some unique challenges.\n\nThe company recently parted ways with three members of its C-suite, one of whom allegedly bit someone’s nose. A recent LA Times report called into question the hygiene of a Beyond Meat facility in Pennsylvania, though the company stands by the cleanliness of the plant, saying that its “food safety protocols go above industry and regulatory standards.”\n\nAlso, a promising partnership with McDonald’s (MCD) has stalled in the United States. And fierce competition is squeezing sales, including in frozen, plant-based chicken, a category that is growing while refrigerated plant-based meat sales falter.\n\nThe company’s plan is to focus on cash flow and profitability rather than growth, and become more strategic in its restaurant and marketing initiatives, among other things.\n\n“Despite the current headwinds facing our business and category, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the long-term growth and impact expected from our global brand,” a Beyond Meat spokesperson told CNN Business in response to a request for comment.\n\n“They’ve got a big task ahead of them,” said Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at financial services firm BTIG. Next year will be about “trying to get their financials in order to a place where they can sustain themselves,” he added. “It’s a tall order.”\n\nWhere’s the McPlant?\n\nLast year, Beyond Meat announced a strategic partnership with McDonald’s, including working with the burger chain on the McPlant, a plant-based burger.\n\nSince then, the McPlant has been added to the McDonald’s menu permanently in some European markets.\n\nIn the US, McDonald’s (MCD) tested out the burger in some locations. But it hasn’t added the item to the menu, and it’s not clear if or when that will happen.\n\n“I don’t think it’s totally off the table, but I’m not sure that it’s going to be [Beyond’s] saving grace at this point,” said Saleh.\n\nBeyond has also lost its spot on the Dunkin’ menu. The coffee chain enthusiastically rolled out a breakfast sandwich with Beyond sausage nationally in 2019, but stopped working with Beyond last year.\n\nMcDonald's tested the McPlant, but has not added it permanently to US menus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBeyond still has plenty of partnerships with restaurants, but many of them are limited-time tests.\n\n“In the last 12 months, we have had 25 trials for permanent menu launches with nine distinct products,” said Beyond CEO Ethan Brown during a November analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results.\n\nBrown positioned the launches as long-term investments, saying they won’t generate big sales in the short term but should pay off eventually. But getting a permanent menu spot might be challenging, noted Kathryn Fenner, principal at foodservice consulting firm Technomic.\n\n“Even if they sell, say 30 to 40 of these plant-based burgers a day … that still pales in comparison to their traditional proteins,” she said, speaking about plant-based burgers in general. And these days, making a limited-time offer permanent is a tough sell because operators have been slimming down their menus, she noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Burger King continues to sell the Impossible Whopper nationally. “We haven’t been experiencing what Beyond Meat and some of the other brands in the space have reported,” said Impossible foods spokesperson Keely Sulprizio. Impossible is private and is not required to share its sales data publicly.\n\nIn the grocery store, Beyond is facing a swell of competition.\n\nCompetition heats up\n\nBeyond has embraced competition in the past. But now, rivals are interfering with its bottom line.\n\n“We believe that healthy competition within plant-based meat is a good thing as it brings investment in marketing to the category,” said Brown during the November analyst call.\n\n“However, in the current environment, we are not seeing this benefit,” he said. “Instead, more companies are pursuing the same or fewer consumers.” Brown said Beyond is the leader in refrigerated plant-based meat, and that he expects some brands to pull back or consolidate in the future.\n\nIt’s true that the plant-based meat pie is smaller these days. Retail sales of meat alternatives fell about 12% in the year through November 6, according to data from IRI. Ground plant-based meat fell about 19%, and patties were down 30% in that period.\n\nBut frozen chicken alternatives are growing. Strips and cutlets sales increased about 16% and nuggets jumped nearly 28%.\n\n“Frozen plant-based chicken is the largest single subcategory in all of plant-based meats and continues to grow at a double-digit pace,” said Brown during the analyst call. “So we are pleased to be expanding our presence of additional chicken items.”\n\nBeyond Meat introduced plant-based chicken strips in retail in 2014, but pulled the product in 2019. It launched a retooled version, Beyond Chicken Tenders, in stores in 2021, and has built its plant-based chicken portfolio since then.\n\nBut in the few years Beyond’s product was off the market, new entrants rushed into the space.\n\nNuggs, a plant-based chicken nugget made by startup Simulate, has made a splash online thanks to its bold packaging over the last few years and has been expanding in retail.\n\nDaring, another plant-based chicken company, launched its product in the US in 2020. Daring’s chicken alternative became available at Whole Foods last year.

Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.\n\nChocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.\n\n“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”\n\nIn the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.\n\nChocolate sales are booming. Adobe Stock\n\nOne reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.\n\nIn the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.\n\n“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.\n\nEven chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.\n\nElasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”\n\nHershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.\n\n“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”\n\nCustomers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.\n\nIt’s not s’mores without Hershey\n\nCompanies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.\n\nAccording to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.\n\nShoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”\n\nMondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.\n\nEventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.\n\nAnd though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.\n\nIRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.\n\nStill, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Fast food prices are jumping.

That means that if a steak burrito cost $8 this time in 2021, it’s now $8.80.\n\nIt’s not the only fast food option to get more expensive. McDonald’s (MCD) increased its menu prices by about 6% last year, while Starbucks (SBUX) hiked prices in October and again in January.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t hit sales. Chipotle reported revenue of $2 billion for the final three months of 2021, beating expectations. Comparable restaurant sales climbed more than 15%. Shares of the company are up 6.5% in premarket trading.\n\n“We’re pretty fortunate with the pricing power that we have,” CEO Brian Niccol said in an interview with CNBC. “Our brand is really strong.” He noted a chicken burrito is still less than $8 in most US markets.\n\nEating out has been a significant component of surging inflation. Food away from home got about 6% more expensive last year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDriving the increase: Companies like Chipotle have had to pay workers a lot more to combat staff shortages. In May, the company increased the pay of its restaurant workers to an average of $15 per hour. Ingredients and transporting goods have also become more expensive.\n\nThese factors aren’t expected to dissipate any time soon. Food commodity prices have jumped 6% so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs. And workers continue to be in the driver’s seat as demand for labor stays high.\n\n“We continue to see pressure on wages,” Niccol said on a call with analysts. “We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front.”\n\nWith this in mind, restaurant executives are telling Wall Street they expect price hikes to continue.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts last week that the company has “additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year” in order to “mitigate cost pressures.”\n\nNiccol also indicated additional price rises are on the table at Chipotle.\n\n“Beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated, if we don’t see it abate, we’ll have to take some additional pricing there,” he said.\n\nChipotle’s chief financial officer said they “keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down,” but “it just hasn’t happened yet.”\n\nOn the radar: The latest data on US consumer inflation arrives tomorrow. Climbing food prices — both inside and out of the home — are likely to be a big part of the story.\n\nAnd while economists expect inflation to decline in the second half of the year, as central banks pull back support for the economy, executives in the restaurant industry don’t sound like they’re expecting much to change, at least for the time being.\n\nOmicron is hurting demand for Lyft rides\n\nAfter years of burning cash, Lyft (LYFT) is trimming its losses. The ride-sharing company lost $1 billion last year, compared to $1.8 billion in 2020. On an adjusted basis, Lyft (LYFT) posted its first-ever full-year profit, a key milestone for investors.\n\nSo why is Lyft’s stock down 4% in premarket trading?\n\nWhen reporting its latest earnings after markets closed on Tuesday, the company warned that its current quarter will be affected by the Omicron variant.\n\nPreviously, it had expected a “strong” increase in ridership during the first quarter. Now it thinks rides will be “down slightly,” hurting revenue.\n\n“Ultimately, given the expected impact of Omicron on [the first quarter] and the unknown shape of the recovery, which could carry into [the second quarter], our near-term revenue growth acceleration will likely be affected,” CEO Logan Green told analysts.\n\nGreen said he expects demand to recover now that the wave of Omicron infections in the United States appears to have peaked, however.\n\n“In the last week of January, we saw a pickup in rideshare rides that we see as a positive signal,” he said.\n\nInvestor insight: Even though Lyft’s finances are improving, Wall Street has remained skeptical. Shares fell 13% last year, compared to a 27% rise in the S&P 500. They’re down almost 4% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin is four times more volatile than gold\n\nBitcoin has gained 15% so far this month after a dismal December and January. But based on its ongoing swings, mainstream investors are unlikely to get too excited.\n\n“The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note to clients published this week.\n\nThere’s been lots of chatter in investment circles about bitcoin becoming a form of “digital gold,” since it’s an asset that theoretically could retain its value even if stocks and bonds drop and can therefore help diversify portfolios.\n\nBut bitcoin is currently about four times as volatile as the yellow metal. Based on this calculation, Panigirtzoglou puts bitcoin’s “fair value” — the best estimate of its price based on market conditions — at $38,000, below its current price near $44,000.\n\nIn the longer term, if investors do start to treat bitcoin like gold, JPMorgan thinks its value could rise to $150,000.\n\nBut that’s a while away. For the time being, bitcoin’s ebbs and flows remain closely correlated with the stock market, Panigirtzoglou notes. And its rockiness compared to other assets is likely to keep some would-be buyers away.\n\nUp next\n\nCVS (CVS), Fox Corporation (FOXA), MSG Entertainment (MSG) and Canopy Growth (CGC) report results before US markets open.

But now they’re facing a problem: not enough drivers.\n\nIn early March, Domino’s then-CEO Ritch Allison warned that a driver shortage would be a drag on business.\n\n“Delivery driver staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term,” he said, pointing to a dip in deliveries in the last quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\nHe was right — and the problem has continued into this year. In the first three months of 2022, delivery at Domino’s US stores open at least a year fell by 10.7% compared to the prior-year period, Allison said in an April analyst call, noting that he’s “disappointed” with the delivery results. Overall, sales at those stores fell 3.6% in that period, due in part to staffing issues.\n\nThe difficulty finding and keeping employees has hampered businesses across multiple sectors, but the restaurant industry has been hit particularly hard, leading to shorter operating hours and longer wait times for customers.\n\nIt’s not just Domino’s (DPZ). Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Brands (YUM), is also hurting. The brand’s same-store sales in the United States dropped 6% in the first quarter due to “our delivery channel, where capacity constraints limited our ability to meet demand,” said Yum Brands (YUM) CEO David Gibbs during an analyst call discussing the results. “This was driven by staffing challenges, mainly from delivery driver shortages that have been felt across the industry.”\n\nDomino's has a delivery problem. Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nSlow service is bad for business, and not just because of missed sales — a few late pizzas from Domino’s could send someone straight into the arms of Pizza Hut, Papa Johns (PZZA) or another competitor.\n\nSo how do you solve the delivery problem? Hiring more drivers is the obvious solution, but that isn’t easy.\n\nThe US jobs market has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic, but it’s getting there. Of the 22 million jobs lost after Covid-19 hit the United States in 2020, about 20.8 million have been restored. And the labor market seems to be cooling down this year, making hiring more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for delivery is through the roof. Domino’s noted that although its delivery rate has fallen compared to 2021, it’s still up nearly 6% over 2019. Other restaurants are also reporting higher demand, and predict that it will stick.\n\nDriver shortages also could become a vicious cycle, noted Cowen restaurant analyst Andrew Charles.\n\n“Drivers take the job because they want to make tips. If there’s less deliveries to make .. that hurts in trying to get delivery drivers,” he said. “I don’t think this is a very easy solve.”\n\nPizza companies will have to do more than just try to convince more drivers to deliver more pizzas. Filling the void will require other changes, like outsourcing phone orders to dedicated call centers, leaning more heavily on tech and, if they can swing it, charging more for pizza.\n\nCall centers and delivery providers\n\nOne way to add more drivers without hiring more people is to reassign current employees. Domino’s is hoping call centers will help.\n\nThe company is “facing some pretty severe staffing shortfalls,” Charles said. “So whatever they can do to help alleviate that is under consideration.” He estimated that about 10% to 15% of Domino’s US orders are made over the phone.\n\nBy mid-May, Domino’s expects between 2,500 and 3,000 Domino’s locations to be using external call centers in some way. They should “allow stores to focus on production and delivery when they’re short-staffed during peak hours,” said CEO Russell Weiner during the April call.\n\nIn addition to tapping call centers, Domino’s is also working to make employees’ jobs easier, including using tech that will make hiring and training better, a spokesperson told CNN Business. So far, Domino’s has stayed away from third-party delivery providers such as DoorDash, Uber Eats or Grubhub, which charge a commission fee — but “nothing is off the table,” said Weiner.\n\nPizza Hut is also facing staffing challenges. Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nPizza Hut is also taking several steps to help fix its delivery issues.\n\n“The team is prioritizing restaurant operations, including a focus on improving staffing levels, restoring operating hours, increasing online ordering availability and more effectively leveraging the use of our overflow call centers,” said Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs during a May analyst call. But Pizza Hut has also been using third-party delivery drivers to “augment our own delivery drivers,” he said.\n\nGibbs is hoping a tech acquisition will help improve the situation.\n\nLast year, the company completed its purchase of Dragontail, which has an AI-enabled platform designed to make restaurant operations more efficient, including reducing disruptions due to driver shortages. The brand is piloting the platform in more than 100 of its thousands of US stores to try to upgrade the delivery network.\n\nAnother way to reduce the impact of the problem? Charge customers more.\n\nThe Papa Johns solution\n\nPapa Johns has also faced staffing shortages, but “we feel pretty good about staffing,” said CEO Robert Lynch during a May analyst call discussing first quarter results. In North America, sales at Papa Johns stores open at least a year popped 1.9% in the first quarter.\n\nLynch thinks the company’s partnership with third-party aggregators has helped, but what’s really giving him confidence is the company’s pricing strategy. “Our premium positioning is a different model than the folks who are talking about staffing” as a big issue, he said.\n\n“We’re premium-priced. We don’t need quite as many transactions, and therefore, we’re less impacted by the staffing challenges that we’re all seeing.” In other words, it doesn’t matter as much to Papa Johns how many customers buy its pizza, because each pie is priced higher than what its main competitors charge.\n\nUntil the worker shortage eases, however, pizza lovers might have to wait a little longer for their pies.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/economy/rising-prices-grocery-shopping/index.html", "title": "Why grocery prices keep surging | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nGrocery costs keep climbing. Prices of meat, seafood, produce, cereal and other kitchen staples shot up 9% in 2021.\n\nThat’s according to data from IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, and the trend is continuing this year. Big-name brands are raising prices: Kraft Heinz (KHC) announced hikes on Velveeta cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee and Kool-Aid. General Mills (GIS) and Campbell Soup (CPB) also jacked up food prices, and Procter & Gamble (PG) raised the price of Tide laundry products.\n\nWhy do grocery staples keep rising with no end in sight? Blame the supply chain, the ongoing labor shortage and Covid.\n\n“A lot of that is actually a delayed reaction from the [issues and volatility] that the supply chain has been feeling for the last several months,” said Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations for FMI, The Food Industry Association. “They put off as long as possible, and now we’re going to feel the effects of that for the next few months.”\n\nThe number of cargo ships parked off the California Coast hit a record high in January, with nearly 100 still waiting offshore, even after the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach unloaded 13% more containers than ever before in 2021.\n\nThe cost of labor, fuel, ingredients, packaging, and transportation keep skyrocketing, driven largely by the worker shortage and a massive spike in demand for goods.\n\n“The extraordinary cost pressure that we’re seeing across all different business right now is landing in that last resort, and that’s why you’re seeing the inflation,” said Tony Sarsam, CEO of food distributor SpartanNash.\n\nOmicron is adding to price pressures, peeling workers from warehouses, processing facilities and grocery stores. For example, US pork production dropped 8% in the week ended January 14, with many employees either sick or quarantined.\n\nDisruptions everywhere\n\nWith fewer workers, distributors are cutting deliveries to some grocery stores by 20% to 40%.\n\nFresh Encounter, an Ohio-based grocery chain, says more than 40% of orders have been delayed or canceled.\n\n“It’s been whack-a-mole. It’s one item one day, and then a completely different segment the next,” said Fresh Encounter CEO Michael Needler Jr. “Obviously, our customers are frustrated when they can’t get their items, but hopefully we’re able to have a substitute item for them.”\n\nA recent survey found 37% of customers are “very concerned” about grocery shortages, which they’ve seen on items like pet food, paper goods and cream cheese.\n\nVarious items have come in and out of stock throughout the past year. Right now, soft drinks are one of the hardest products to find on the shelves.\n\n“We’ve had issues with some sweeteners, where they’ve been delayed, and we’ve had issues with cans and glass,” said Norm Snyder, CEO of beverage company Reed’s, adding that the labor shortage has been the biggest obstacle, especially during Covid surges.\n\n“You have a group of people that are all working in close proximity to one another,” he added. “If one person gets sick, the protocol, because everyone’s exposed, is to shut down. So, we’ve had several instances where lines have been shut down for one or two weeks.”\n\nThe Biden Administration says it is working to ease inflation, accusing some of the largest meat processors of raising prices just to drive up profits. But experts are projecting more grocery price hikes ahead.\n\n“We’re going to continue to see supply chain disruption and we will continue to see periods of inflation, at least for the next several months, as the industry continues to recalibrate,” FMI’s Baker said.\n\nWhat you can do about it\n\nBeth Moncel, who runs the blog BudgetBytes to teach people how to cook on a budget, offered several tips for grocery shoppers.\n\n“You have to be really strategic and intentional,” Moncel said. “Planning is probably one of the best ways to save money on groceries.”\n\nMoncel suggested shoppers peruse grocery sales flyers before shopping, join store loyalty programs and plan meals around cheap, filling items like rice and beans as well as shelf-stable ingredients like frozen vegetables.\n\n“That’s really going to help you reduce waste,” Moncel said. “And reducing waste is probably one of the biggest areas where you can save money on your groceries because every time you throw food away, you’re literally just throwing money in the garbage.”\n\nDeals can be had, if you know where to look. For example, Florida-based supermarket chain Winn-Dixie announced it is lowering the cost of 150 popular items by roughly 18% to ease inflation’s burden on shoppers.\n\n“We work with our national brand partners in selecting those products that mean that much to the customer at this particular time,” said Anthony Hucker, CEO of Southeastern Grocers, Winn-Dixie’s parent company. “Secondly, we have our own brand of products that typically range between 20 and 30% less than the national brand… And the third thing we do is actually absorb some of the costs ourselves.”", "authors": ["Gabe Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/economy/nightcap-economy-recession-earnings-fed/index.html", "title": "Fear and loathing and layoffs: What you need to know about the ...", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter.

Let’s break it down.\n\nTheme 1: Pandemic fortunes are reversing\n\nWe’ve said it before, but it’s worth repeating: The so-called winners of the pandemic — those companies like Peloton and Zoom that catered to life in lockdown — are reckoning with the fact that people are going outside (or into the office) again.\n\nExhibit A: Shopify. The e-commerce company is The e-commerce company is laying off 10% of its global staff of around 10,000 people. CEO Tobi Lutke admitted in a memo Tuesday that Shopify essentially bit off more than it could chew. It expanded too rapidly. That’s a similar tale of woe that befell Peloton, which overzealously built out production in the heyday of 2020 and is now in something of an existential crisis.\n\nLayoffs and hiring slowdowns are taking root across the tech sector, with companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Netflix either laying off staff or significantly tapping the brakes.\n\nTheme 2: Consumers are fed up.\n\nEveryone’s gotta eat and get to work. But consumers are increasingly finding their budgets don’t allow for much beyond those two necessities.\n\nWalmart shares tumbled 10% in late trading Monday after it surprised Wall Street by slashing its profit outlook and announcing markdowns to help clear a backlog of inventory. Basically, we’ve stopped buying fun things like clothes and kitchen goods because we’re spending too much on food and fuel.\n\naffordable splurge for some or a nutritional necessity for others, especially when grocery prices are up an average of 12% for the year. McDonald’s, meanwhile, saw sales pop even as it raised menu prices . We’re at a point when McD’s is anaffordable splurge for some or a nutritional necessity for others, especially when grocery prices are up an average of 12% for the year.\n\nAmericans are pissed off. A closely watched survey showed consumers growing even more pessimistic about the economy for the third month in a row.\n\nThat’s important because our collective obsession with splurging on stuff we don’t need is, like, the No. 1 thing that fuels America’s giant, world-dominating economy.\n\nTheme 3: Supply chains are still broken.\n\nIt’s been over two years and the global supply chain hasn’t fully recovered from the turducken of chaos that knocked it offline in the spring of 2020.\n\nSee here: General Motors saw its net profit fall 40% in the second quarter, blaming supply chain snarls that have made it difficult for virtually all industries to secure essential computer chips for the better part of two years.\n\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nSadly, I don’t have a crystal ball. Best I can offer is a Magic 8 Ball answer to any question about whether we’re bound for a recession or an extended period of inflation: Reply hazy, try again.\n\nAs we wrote yesterday, stuff’s real weird right now, and technical definitions aside, many Americans already feel like it’s a recession. And it’s worth remembering, my colleague Paul R. La Monica writes, that not all recessions are created equal. Most investors aren’t expecting a 2008-level disaster, and the Fed could always reverse course and begin cutting rates to spur growth, as it did in 2001 following the dot-com crash.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 3.2%\n\nThe International Monetary Fund offered a new and fairly grim forecast for global growth this year and next. The agency now expects major slowdowns in the three biggest economies — the United States, China and Europe — and says the global economy is likely to grow just 3.2% this year, down from 6.1% in 2021. Next year might be even worse: just 2.9%, only slightly above the 2.5% growth level that the IMF has typically considered a global recession.\n\nKEY QUOTE: “The outlook has darkened significantly,” wrote Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s director of research. “The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one.”\n\nSUPERSIZE ME\n\nEven in a bear market, where most investors are keeping their heads down and fleeing risk, there are always a few adrenaline junkies ready to shout YOLO and do something stupid.\n\nEnter the single-stock ETF.\n\nHere’s the deal: An asset management firm called AXS Investments recently launched funds that let investors make supersized bets on — or against — the daily performance of individual stocks, my colleague Paul R. La Monica reports. The gist is, you can turn small bets into big gains if you can stomach the risk. (And it’s a big risk, as AXS itself takes pains to explain in its own literature about the funds.)\n\nHow it works: First off, a regular ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is nothing too exotic or especially risky. It’s a pooled investment that’s similar to a mutual fund, usually tracking a particular index or sector.\n\nBut there’s a new spin on the ETF that uses derivatives contracts to let traders amplify their positions.\n\nFor example, if you don’t buy the Tesla hype, you could short the stock, which basically means you place a wager that the share price will go down, and if you’re right you can make a tidy profit. But if you really, really believe Tesla is going down, now you can buy an ETF that offers only super-short positions on that stock.\n\nThink of it as a turbo boost on whatever short or long position you’re taking, juicing both the risk and the rewards.\n\nHere’s another example: Say you own a single share of Pfizer.\n\nOn Monday, your share would have gone up 1.1%.\n\nBut if you instead bought a long single-stock ETF, you’d be up 2.4%\n\nIf you had a short single-stock ETF, you’d be down 2.3%\n\nThe risks are basically endless. The Securities and Exchange Commission knows that, but it approved the products anyway. YOLO, you know?\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nAXS, the SEC and pretty much any professional financial adviser would say these things are dangerous even for seasoned traders and should be used with caution.\n\nBut, like, everyone has access to them now via brokerage apps on their phones, so, I don’t know why we should expect that inexperienced traders won’t dip their toe, or go full swan-dive, into these assets.\n\nRemember GameStop?

The 15,000-word article portrayed him as an ineffectual leader presiding over a \"meltdown\" at the news organization, including a widely-criticized town hall featuring former President Donald Trump, plummeting ratings and crashing morale among top anchors and correspondents.\n\nLicht took the reins of CNN last year after the network's then-parent company WarnerMedia merged with Discovery. The new company made swift changes at the network, immediately shuttering CNN+, a streaming service that had launched only a month earlier, laying off hundreds of workers and announcing plans to cut back on non-news programming. Licht, appointed by CEO David Zaslav, arrived with a mandate to make CNN more middle-of-the-road in its coverage, which many interpreted as more right-wing. In the Atlantic profile, Licht wavers about the mission of CNN and the definition of \"absolute truth.\"\n\nOpinion:After devastating Chris Licht profile, CNN should report only on its own drama!\n\nIn a staff meeting Wednesday, Zaslav told CNN employees, \"I met with Chris and he will be leaving CNN. ...

Zucker was forced out of the company in February 2022 after admitting that he had violated corporate rules by not revealing his romantic relationship with a key deputy, CNN marketing chief Allison Gollust. Filling Zucker's shoes was no easy task, and Licht had an unconventional – and perhaps underqualified – background for the job, coming directly from CBS, where he was executive producer of the late-night talk show, \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\" He had also previously worked in morning television, producing \"CBS This Morning\" and MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nLicht's primary initiative in his short tenure at CNN was the relaunch of its morning show \"CNN This Morning,\" naming Don Lemon, Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow as co-anchors. But in April, Lemon, who had a history of controversial and embarrassing comments, was ousted by the company in a messy firing that spilled over onto Twitter. And he threw Collins into battling Trump in a contentious town hall, stocked with an audience of loyal supporters of the former president who hissed at her and cheered him on.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/06/07/relief-chris-licht-out-at-cnn/70299362007/", "title": "CNN fired its CEO. Here's why the network needs to get it together", "text": "Chris Licht, CNN’s CEO so mired in controversy and bad decisions that the term “embattled” would have sounded like a welcome relief, is gone from the network after little more than a year.\n\nGood.\n\nHe clearly wasn’t up to the task of running the place. Now maybe they can find someone who can.\n\n“I met with Chris and he will be leaving CNN,” David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company that owns CNN, told employees Wednesday morning, according to the network’s website. It was an ignominious end to a rocky tenure that often seemed doomed from the start.\n\nRead the story:Embattled CNN CEO Chris Licht stepping down after controversial year\n\nWhy is Chris Licht leaving CNN?\n\nIf you want an idea of how things were going, this is from the network’s own story about Licht’s exit: “Licht’s departure, which came days after a devastating 15,000-word profile in The Atlantic, capped a tumultuous year for CNN, marked by layoffs, historically low ratings, and rock-bottom employee morale.”\n\nIt doesn’t get much uglier than that. And it doesn’t even include the network’s disastrous Donald Trump town hall, in which the former president spent more than an hour lying and trying to bully moderator Kaitlan Collins.\n\nAccording to the brutal Atlantic story, Licht had said the crowd would be “extra Trumpy.” And it played like a Trump rally, not an exercise in journalism.\n\nOf course, ratings are the one truly unforgivable sin in TV. CNN’s are awful under Licht; two days after the town hall temporarily boosted ratings, Newsmax had more viewers in prime time. Newsmax!\n\nIt’s a bizarre turn for the original cable news network, which seems to be lost in terms of its mission.\n\nZaslav’s marching orders for Licht were to push CNN more toward the political middle. It makes some sense — Fox News is a right-wing propaganda machine; MSNBC is basically the same thing for the left. You’d think there would be a fair amount of room right down the center.\n\nBut maybe not. Maybe the nation is too polarized, and no longer turns to news outlets for anything other than confirmation of their preexisting beliefs.\n\nIf that’s the case it’s tragic — not for TV news, but for democracy.\n\nLicht botched the shift. His entire tenure was marked by bold moves that were at best questioned, often ridiculed. He shut down CNN+ shortly after his arrival. He rebuilt the network’s morning show, with Collins, Poppy Harlow as co-hosts; their chemistry, crucial in morning TV, was non-existent.\n\nDon Lemon was fired not long after saying on-air that Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, “isn’t in her prime, sorry.” He also said that a woman is “considered to be in her prime in her 20s and 30s and maybe 40s.”\n\nThose are Lemon’s words, not Licht’s, obviously. But it was just another blow to the network’s reputation.\n\nDonald Trump soured Republicans on CNN for years\n\nLicht clearly wanted to mend fences with Republicans. And, after years of Trump bashing the network and calling it “fake news” and an enemy of the people, the thought of appearing on CNN became a form of betrayal for some Republicans.\n\nLicht is right, both sides should be heard — if both sides are dealing with reality. Bringing on election deniers in an attempt to appear fair to both sides of a political argument, as Licht did, is not objective reporting. It’s irresponsible, because for the deniers, reality is not a constraint.\n\nIt’s simple: Don’t give liars a platform.\n\nWho will replace Chris Licht as CNN CEO?\n\nZaslav told employees Wednesday the company was looking for a new CEO, and that it would take some time to find one.\n\nWhoever it is, they would do well to remember that bothsideism isn’t journalism. It’s pandering. It’s weak, and it doesn’t deserve to be rewarded with an audience.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you should demonize one side or another — unless it does something that deserves to be demonized. If one side is attacking the structures of democracy, it’s fine to say so. In fact, it’s essential to.\n\nIt’s the old adage about journalism, repeated often: If one person tells you it’s raining and another tells you it’s not, it isn’t your job to quote them both. It’s your job to look out the window and report the truth.\n\nLicht uses a form of that analogy often in the Atlantic story.

Why let other news organizations rake in ratings and page views with their coverage of a network trying – and failing – to redefine itself?\n\nCNN's hopeless quest for middle ground seems to make everyone angry\n\nAside from Licht, who according to The Atlantic profile and other reports seemed simultaneously overconfident and in over his head, CNN has been struggling with staking out an identity between the left-leaning MSNBC and far-right-leaning Fox News.\n\nThat explains the network’s willingness to host a town hall that allowed former President Donald Trump, now a GOP presidential candidate, to lie and lie and lie some more in prime time while also lambasting the media, including CNN itself. It was an embarrassment, hated by both the left and right and people at the network.\n\nPlease explain where there's middle ground between believing in facts and believing in nonsense\n\nThat’s the problem with seeking a middle ground in this political climate: What is the middle ground between “the 2020 presidential election was legitimate” and “the 2020 presidential election was rigged and stolen by a liberal Deep State hellbent on destroying America”?\n\nWhere exactly is the middle ground between “LGBTQ+ people exist and should be able to live their lives safely and authentically” and “A DISNEY MOVIE HAD A GAY CHARACTER SO I’M GOING TO LABEL THE WHOLE CORPORATION AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS IT A PEDOPHILE”?\n\nCNN could try to find a rational space between conservative voters who reject the hardcore-MAGA conspiracy/culture war nonsense and liberal-minded viewers seeking balance. But that doesn’t seem to be in the network’s plans. Instead, it keeps trying to get the people who chant “CNN SUCKS!” to like it, like a lonely kid hoping a handful of bologna will get the dog to love him.\n\nIt's time for CNN to lean into its own soap opera and give people what they want\n\nThe most compelling thing about CNN right now is the reality-show-style mess CNN has created. So THAT’S where the network’s bosses need to focus their attention. All CNN, all the time. They’ve got reporters right there in the studio! Let them do their jobs and give the people what they want.\n\nAnderson Cooper’s nightly show “Anderson Cooper 360°” could be renamed “Anderson Cooper 180°.” It would feature Cooper spinning around 180-degrees and looking to see what kind of zaniness and absurd miscalculations are happening in the studio behind him.\n\nMaybe CNN could bring back Chris Cuomo and Jeff Zucker for some insight\n\n“CNN Tonight” could keep its name, as it would focus on what new mess CNN finds itself in each night. Fired CNN host Chris Cuomo could be rehired to host, perhaps alongside former network head Jeff Zucker, who was forced to step down last year for not revealing a romantic relationship with another senior executive.\n\nAnd Wolf Blitzer’s “The Situation Room” could be called “A Room Full of Situations at CNN,” featuring Blitzer thoughtfully caressing his beard while recounting the poor decisions being made around him.\n\nInstead of being “The World’s News Leader,” CNN can become “The World’s News-About-CNN Leader.”\n\nThink about it, Mr. Licht and Co.

According to the newspaper, the audio details a conversation between Martinez, Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera.\n\nMuch of the conversation focused on maps proposed by the city’s redistricting commission and the councilmembers’ frustration with them, as well as the need to “ensure that heavily Latino districts did not lose economic assets” in the once-in-a-decade process, according to the Times.\n\nThe councilmembers then discussed Councilmember Mike Bonin, a White man. In clips of the leaked audio posted by the Times, Martinez is heard recounting a conversation and says “Bonin thinks he’s f**king Black.”\n\nAccording to the Times, Martinez says Bonin appeared with his son on a float in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade and he “handled his young Black son as though he were an accessory.” The boy is 8 years old, according to a Facebook post by his father.\n\nThe Times reported that Martinez also said of Bonin’s child, “Parece changuito,” or “He’s like a monkey.”\n\nIn the leaked audio, Martinez can be heard speaking about Bonin’s son allegedly misbehaving while at the parade by hanging from a railing of their float, saying “this kid is going to tip us over.”\n\n“They’re raising him like a little White kid,” Martinez said in the audio released by The Times. “I was like, this kid needs a beatdown. Let me take him around the corner and then I’ll bring him back.”\n\nThe audio, according to The Times, was part of a conversation that took place in October 2021. CNN has not been able to verify the audio recording.\n\nIt surfaced just weeks before the November 8 election that will decide the next mayor of Los Angeles and several city council seats. It is unclear who recorded the audio.\n\n“The context of this conversation was concern over the redistricting process and concern about the potential negative impact it might have on communities of color. My work speaks for itself. I’ve worked hard to lead this city through its most difficult time,” Martinez said in a statement to CNN, made before her resignation.\n\nBonin and his husband, Sean Arian, had asked the City Council to remove Martinez as council president and said she needs to resign from office.\n\n“We are appalled, angry and absolutely disgusted that Nury Martinez attacked our son with horrific racist slurs, and talked about her desire to physically harm him. It’s vile, abhorrent, and utterly disgraceful,” the couple said in a joint statement.\n\nOur family statement about today's ugly and hateful news. pic.twitter.com/0fPPXwsS5B — Mike Bonin (@mikebonin) October 9, 2022\n\nBonin and Arian added that they are “equally angry and disgusted by the ugly racist comments about our son from Kevin de León and Ron Herrera, who should also resign their posts, and by the tacit acceptance of those remarks from Gil Cedillo.”\n\nThe California/Hawaii State Conference of the NAACP and the Los Angeles Branch of the organization are calling for the resignation of all council members involved in that conversation and asking the city to investigate “how far the racial animus has impacted hiring and other decisions of the City Council,” they said in a joint statement.\n\n“We will not sit idly by and allow our elected representatives to engage in these kinds of disgusting and racist behaviors,” said Latricia Mitchell, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP.\n\nCouncil member Nithya Raman, who according to The Times was also referenced in the leaked audio, released a statement to CNN Sunday also calling for resignations.\n\n“Racist, homophobic, and deeply cruel statements like these are disqualifying for elected office in LA. The people who made them should resign. If they don’t, I’ll vote to remove them from Council leadership at the first opportunity,” Raman said.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Cedillo called the comments about Bonin’s son “simply unacceptable.”\n\n“I want to start by apologizing. While I did not engage in the conversation in question, I was present at times during this meeting last year,” Cedillo said. “It is my instinct to hold others accountable when they use derogatory or racially divisive language. Clearly, I should have intervened. I failed in holding others and myself to the highest standard. The hurtful and harmful remarks made about my colleague’s son were simply unacceptable. We choose public life, but our families should always be off limits and never part of the political discourse.”\n\nHerrera has not responded to CNN’s request for comment, but the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO tweeted an apology from him to Bonin and his family and Black and Oaxacan community members.\n\n“There is no justification and no excuse for the vile remarks made in that room. Period,” the apology said. “And I didn’t step up to stop them and I will have to bear the burden of that cross moving forward.”\n\nDe León released a statement to CNN Sunday saying, “On that day, I fell short of the expectations we set for our leaders – and I will hold myself to a higher standard.\n\n“There were comments made in the context of this meeting that are wholly inappropriate; and I regret appearing to condone and even contribute to certain insensitive comments made about a colleague and his family in private. I’ve reached out to that colleague personally,” de León said.\n\nDespite the apologies, Bonin and Arian point to what they call a coordinated effort to weaken Black political representation in Los Angeles.\n\n“The conversation revealed several layers of contempt for the people of Los Angeles, and a cynical, ugly desire to divide the City rather than serve it,” Bonin and Arian said in their statement.\n\nIn her statement announcing her resignation, Martinez apologized to Bonin and his family.\n\n“As a mother, I know better and I am sorry. I am truly ashamed. I know this is the result of my own actions. I’m sorry to your entire family for putting you through this,” Martinez said.\n\n“As someone who believes deeply in the empowerment of communities of color, I recognize my comments undercut that goal,” the statement said. “Going forward, reconciliation will be my priority.”\n\nMartinez represents the city’s 6th district, which includes Hollywood, Panorama City and other parts of the San Fernando Valley.", "authors": ["Camila Bernal Sarah Moon", "Camila Bernal", "Sarah Moon"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-friday/index.html", "title": "Uvalde school shooting: School police chief says he didn't keep ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn his first extensive public comments about his actions during last month’s Texas school massacre, the Uvalde school police chief has contradicted previous narratives about his role, telling the Texas Tribune he didn’t consider himself the incident commander and did not instruct officers to refrain from breaching the scene.\n\nChief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who has faced widespread criticism for his role, portrayed a locked, jamb-reinforced classroom door as one of the main obstacles delaying the breach – and the interview published Thursday adds another complication in officials’ often-shifting and sometimes opposing narratives of how law enforcement officers responded to the gunman at Uvalde’s Robb Elementary School on May 24.\n\n“I didn’t issue any orders,” he told the Tribune, though the outlet reports the chief did instruct officers to start breaking the outside windows of other classrooms and begin evacuating students. “I called for assistance and asked for an extraction tool to open the door” of one of the classrooms where the shooting happened, he said.\n\nArredondo “assumed that some other officer or official had taken control of the larger response,” the Tribune wrote. “He took on the role of a front-line responder.”\n\nThe Tribune said it collected the chief’s comments in a phone interview and in statements given through his attorney, George E. Hyde.\n\nIt adds to a pile of differing explanations officials have given about the police response at the school, where authorities say an 18-year-old man shot dead 19 fourth-graders and two teachers in two adjoining classrooms, and remained there for more than an hour until a Border Patrol tactical response team entered and shot him dead. During those 70-plus minutes, some kids were still alive and calling 911 for help; one student told CNN she smeared herself with her friend’s blood and played dead.\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety director Col. Steven McCraw had said May 27 the school police chief – Arredondo – was the incident commander, and the chief believed “there was time to retrieve the keys and wait for a tactical team with the equipment to go ahead and breach the door and take on the subject.”\n\nPete Arredondo, left. CNN\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision,” McCraw said last month about what he said was the supervisor’s call not to confront the shooter. “It was the wrong decision. Period. There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nAlso Thursday, The New York Times reported while law enforcement decided how to breach the two classrooms, they were aware injured victims still were trapped inside with the shooter. The Times cited a transcript of law enforcement body camera footage included in investigative documents and videos from law enforcement reviewed by the Times.\n\nArredondo has not given a public information update or official statement since the day of the attack and declined to answer substantive questions posed by CNN last week, saying he would not release any information while victims’ funerals were ongoing.\n\nArredondo’s attorney, Hyde, texted CNN he and his client are not currently granting more interviews.\n\n“My client needs some time as this has been very difficult for him. At this point we will not be granting any interviews immediately,” Hyde told CNN by text.\n\nMultiple investigations and legislative reviews have been launched after the attack, including by a Texas House investigative committee, but details of the massacre have still been slow to emerge.\n\nWhat the reports reveal about the timeline\n\nAccording to CNN’s analysis of the timeline of events, three Uvalde Police Department officers entered the school at 11:35 a.m., just minutes after the shooter invaded the building. Arredondo also told the Tribune he arrived at the school around 11:35 a.m.\n\nArredondo told the Tribune he left his two radios outside the school because he wanted his hands free to hold his gun. He thought they would slow him down because of a faulty clip and an antenna which might hit him as he ran, the Tribune reported.\n\nOnce the chief and a group of Uvalde officers approached the doors to the adjoining classrooms where the shooter had entered, they found the doors were locked, Arredondo told the Tribune. The gunman then fired shots from inside the classroom that penetrated the classroom door and wall, grazing some of the Uvalde police officers and lodging into the wall next to the hallway where there were other classrooms, according to the report.\n\nBecause the classroom door was reinforced with a steel jamb, officers were unable to kick the door in, Arredondo told the Tribune. The chief said he used his cellphone to call police dispatch and asked for a SWAT team, snipers and tools to open the door.\n\nIt’s unclear at what time Arredondo made the request or ordered officers to begin evacuating students, but CNN has previously reported at about 11:44 a.m. officers were calling for additional equipment, body armor and negotiators, and evacuating students and teachers.\n\nBy 12:03 p.m., as many as 19 officers were in the hallway of the school, officials have said.\n\nAt that time, a student trapped inside one of the besieged classrooms called 911 identifying herself and the classroom she was in. She called two more times several minutes later, telling dispatchers eight to nine students were still alive, according to authorities. Arredondo told the Tribune he was not aware of the 911 calls because he did not have his radios and says no one relayed them to him.\n\nNevertheless, the Times has reported, officers on scene knew injured people were inside. The paper previously reported slain teacher Eva Mireles had called her husband – a Uvalde school police officer – to tell him she was injured and dying.\n\n“People are going to ask why we’re taking so long,” a law enforcement official said at the scene of the shooting, according to Thursday’s Times report, which cites a transcript of law enforcement body camera footage. “We’re trying to preserve the rest of the life,” the transcript reads, according to the Times.\n\nAt some point, the Tribune reports, a janitor provided six keys that were unable to open the door and another key ring with as many as 30 keys was brought to the chief later, but those were unsuccessful as well. It’s unclear at what time Arredondo received the keys.\n\nThe Times reports at around 12:30 p.m., Arredondo said, “We’re ready to breach, but that door is locked,” citing a transcript.\n\nBy then, officers had grown impatient and were voicing concerns, according to the Times. “If there’s kids in there, we need to go in there,” one officer could be heard saying, according to the Times, citing investigative documents.\n\n“Whoever is in charge will determine that,” another officer responds, according to the Times.\n\nStudents run to safety after escaping from a window at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday, May 24. Pete Luna/Uvalde Leader-News\n\nAt 12:50 p.m., a tactical team breached the classrooms using a key from a janitor and fatally shot the gunman, CNN has reported.\n\nArredondo says reinforced door dictated they wait for way to open it, and he didn’t order anyone not to breach\n\nMcCraw, the Texas DPS director, had told reporters May 27 Arredondo had believed the scene had become a “barricaded subject situation” and not an active shooter situation, and it was part of why he said the chief decided not to breach the classroom.\n\nArredondo told the Tribune he did believe the situation had changed from that of an active shooter to that of a barricaded gunman. But, he said, because of the locked, reinforced door, officers couldn’t kick their way in and had little option left but to call for help and wait for other methods to enter.\n\nAnd, he said, he didn’t order anyone not to breach, according to the Tribune.\n\nHis attorney, Hyde, also told the Tribune Arredondo did not issue any orders to other law enforcement agencies.\n\nOn Friday, one of the members of the Texas legislative committee investigating the shooting acknowledged there were conflicting public reports about whether Arredondo was in charge and whether he kept officers from confronting the gunman.\n\n“Some of the tasks that we’re going to have … (will be) to understand what the norm is in those situations, how those decisions are made. And then (we’ll) make our report public when our investigation is concluded,” Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody told “CNN Newsroom.”\n\n“There’s confidential information we’re going to have access to. So our goal is to … survey all of that, and my hope is that we get to talk to Chief Arredondo when we visit Uvalde in the coming weeks, so that we can hear everything and understand everything and compare those statements to the objective evidence that we have,” Moody said.\n\nDPS said on May 31 Arredondo had not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the massacre. The next day, Arredondo told CNN, “I am in contact with DPS every day.”\n\nArredondo’s attorney told the Tribune the chief participated in multiple interviews and follow-up calls with DPS in the days following the shooting and also briefed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other state officials.\n\nBut after the DPS director alleged on May 27 Arredondo made the wrong decision, Arredondo “no longer participated in the investigation to avoid media interference,” Hyde said.\n\nIn a statement responding to the Times report, Abbott’s press secretary Renae Eze said, “The investigations being conducted by the Texas Rangers and the FBI are ongoing, and we look forward to the full results being shared with the victims’ families and the public, who deserve the full truth of what happened that tragic day.”\n\nCNN has reached out to DPS and the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District for comment. CNN has also reached out for comment to The National Incident Management System, which guides all levels of government on how to respond to mass emergency events.\n\nSteve McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, arrives at a meeting of the House Investigative Committee on the Robb Elementary School shooting. Jay Janner/AP\n\nInvestigative committee digs for answers\n\nOn Thursday, the Texas House investigative committee held its first hearing in its probe into the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nThe panel may release its preliminary findings before the full probe is complete, Republican state Rep. Dustin Burrows, the committee chairman, said in the panel’s opening remarks. The preliminary report is expected to be complete by the end of the month, a source close to the committee told CNN.\n\nBurrows, along with the two other committee members – Moody and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman – heard private testimony from top Texas Department of Public Safety officials Thursday, including from McCraw, according to a witness list provided by the committee.\n\nBoth Moody and Burrows declined to share details about Thursday’s closed-door session. When asked how it felt reviewing the evidence, Moody told CNN Thursday, “Like every other parent in this state, I’m sad. I’m scared. I’m shocked.”\n\nThe committee will have two days of hearings next week, where they’ll hear from witnesses behind closed doors. A public notice of the hearings did not list the specific witnesses but noted the panel will hear “invited testimony from law enforcement authorities and other affected parties related to” the attack.\n\nThe panel will meet again next week to review more evidence and conduct more interviews, Burrows said.\n\nState and local agencies are also conducting investigations into the massacre and law enforcement response, though residents and officials alike have become frustrated with the apparent lack of transparency and cooperation.\n\n“It’s clear that the state and local officials now are not cooperating with each other,” US Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, told CNN Saturday, noting he’s asked the FBI to take the full lead on the investigation.\n\nThe US Department of Justice will also conduct a federal review of the law enforcement response at the request of Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, the agency announced last week.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe Elizabeth Joseph", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Elizabeth Joseph"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/us/uvalde-shooting-police-chief-pete-arredondo/index.html", "title": "Pete Arredondo: Uvalde school district police chief declines to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPedro “Pete” Arredondo, the embattled Uvalde school police chief who led the flawed law enforcement response to last week’s school shooting and has remained out of the public eye since, spoke exclusively to CNN on Wednesday and declined to answer substantive questions about the massacre.\n\nAccording to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Arredondo has not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the shooting at Robb Elementary.\n\nYet outside his home Wednesday, Arredondo told CNN’s Aaron Cooper, “I am in contact with DPS everyday.”\n\nAnd outside his office minutes later, he told CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz that he’s not going to release any further information while funerals are ongoing.\n\n“We’re going to be respectful to the family,” he said. “We’re going to do that eventually. Whenever this is done and the families quit grieving, then we’ll do that obviously.”\n\nIt’s the first time Arredondo has commented since two brief press statements on the day of the attack, in which he said the gunman was dead but provided little information on the shooting, citing the ongoing investigation. He took no questions at the time and has not appeared in a public forum since.\n\nNineteen children and two teachers were killed in the attack last Tuesday, and officials have so far failed to answer major questions about why police took about 80 minutes to breach two locked classroom doors and confront the gunman.\n\nThe school police chief was identified last week by DPS as the commanding officer who decided not to force their way into the rooms and instead to stand back and wait for reinforcements – even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged police for help.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection tactical team ultimately entered the rooms using a janitor’s keys and fatally shot the suspect, DPS said.\n\nDPS Director Steven McCraw did not identify Arredondo by name, but he said the chief made the “wrong decision” not to engage with the gunman sooner. He said the commanding officer decided to treat the situation like a barricaded suspect rather than an active shooter.\n\nEstablished law enforcement policy, created in the wake of the Columbine school shooting of 1999, calls for police to stop the gunman as fast as possible in an active shooter situation.\n\nArredondo has worked in law enforcement for nearly 30 years and became chief of police of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (CISD) Police Department in March 2020.\n\nIn that role, he completed a school-based law enforcement active shooter training course in December 2021, according to his professional training file obtained by CNN. He also completed a school-based law enforcement active shooter training course with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office in August 2020.\n\nFurther, he completed an Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) program Terrorism Response Tactics course in June 2019, according to the document. The ALERRT program is designed to teach officers techniques to save lives after an active shooting, such as how to apply tourniquets, according to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center.\n\nArredondo sworn in to city council in secret ceremony\n\nArredondo was elected to the Uvalde city council earlier this month, and a special city council meeting to swear him and others in had been set to take place Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Mayor Don McLaughlin said in a statement Monday that the meeting “will not take place as scheduled,” adding “our focus on Tuesday is on our families who lost loved ones.”\n\nInstead, Arredondo was sworn in privately without advance notice to the media. Although there was no formal ceremony, McLaughlin said that members of the council came to City Hall “at their convenience” during the day to be sworn in, adding that Arredondo appeared in person to receive the oath and sign paperwork.\n\n“Out of respect for the families who buried their children today, and who are planning to bury their children in the next few days, no ceremony was held,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.\n\nIn his Monday statement, the mayor said Arredondo was “duly elected” and that there is “nothing in the City Charter, Election Code, or Texas Constitution that prohibits him from taking the oath of office. To our knowledge, we are currently not aware of any investigation of Mr. Arredondo.”\n\nIn his short comments Wednesday, Arredondo said the swearing-in was “a private thing” out of respect for the families, saying the families are the focus right now.", "authors": ["Aaron Cooper Shimon Prokupecz Eric Levenson", "Aaron Cooper", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}]}

The merger aims to create \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity to ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game’s best players.\"\n\nThe terms of the agreement are not fully finalized and are scheduled to be completed in the coming months.\n\n\"After two years of disruption and distraction, this is a historic day for the game we all know and love,\" PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"Going forward, fans can be confident that we will, collectively, deliver on the promise we’ve always made — to promote competition of the best in professional golf and that we are committed to securing and driving the game’s future.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the merger agreement.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: 'I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players'\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who is among the most notable names who bolted from the PGA Tour to join LIV Golf last year, appeared on \"CNN Primetime\" for an interview with anchor Kaitlan Collins to discuss Tuesday's stunning news of a merger between the Tour and LIV.\n\n\"There’s a lot more behind closed doors that’s been going on. What I can tell you is that H-E, Yasir, has always been a staunch supporter of golf globally and wanting to grow the game,\" DeChambeau said, referring to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who is the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. \"That’s been his vision from the start, when we first started talking a few years ago. As it’s come to fruition now I think this is the best thing that could ever happen for the game of golf. And I'm extremely proud to be part of that because of the fact that the fans are going to get what they want, the players are going to experience something a little different, a little new on the PGA Tour side, but I truly believe, in the end, the game of golf wins in this scenario.\"\n\nCollins then asked DeChambeau if he thought that Jay Monahan was a hypocrite after the PGA Tour commissioner had been critical of the Saudi-back golf league and the players who bolted the Tour for LIV.\n\n\"I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players because they were told one thing and something else happened, and our side, we were told one thing and it’s come to fruition. In the end, for me, I want the players, the fans and the game of golf to win,\" DeChambeau said. \"It does stink a little bit from my perspective that the PGA Tour players are not necessarily winning. I hope they can find a way to make sure they are valued in the same way that we are over at LIV. I think that’ll happen, it’s just going to take some time with players pushing back a little bit and trying to figure out what gives them the best opportunity to be successful on their own end. Eventually, we all come back together now and play as one group, and I think that's the best thing.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner: 'People are going to call me a hypocrite'\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday he's well aware \"people are going to call me a hypocrite\" after he made a stunning reversal and merged with LIV Golf having previously denounced the Saudi-backed league over its ties to the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, Monahan described Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as \"a great and world-class investor.\"\n\n“I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite. Anytime I said anything, I said it with the information that I had at that moment, and I said it based on someone that’s trying to compete for the PGA Tour and our players. I accept those criticisms,\" Monahan said in a conference call on Tuesday, according to Golf Week. \"But circumstances do change. I think that in looking at the big picture and looking at it this way, that’s what got us to this point.”\n\nMonahan said the deal has been in the works for seven weeks: \"We just realized that we were better off together than we were fighting or apart, and by thinking about the game at large and eliminating a lot of the friction that’s been out there and doing this in a way where we can move forward.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner held 'intense' player meeting after merger\n\nJay Monahan held a players-only meeting at the Canadian Open Tuesday afternoon following the surprise announcement merger of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf that blindsided many players. Many top players were not present at the meeting, which Monahan described as \"intense, certainly heated,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m not surprised,” Monahan said. “This is an awful lot to ask them to digest. This is a significant change for us. As I’m trying to explain as we go forward, this ultimately was a decision in the best interests of all at the PGA Tour.”\n\nMonahan said that although he expects \"a lot of questions and criticism\" right now, \"players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways\" in the long run.\n\nMichael Kim attended the meeting and said he was \"disappointed as all of you.\" He tweeted, \"Well… the meeting happened… Came in very excited… but not a whole lot happened, too many details still up in the air.\"\n\nGolf Channel's Brandel Chamblee 'disappointed' in PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger\n\nFormer men's pro golfer and current Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee has been one of the most outspoken critics of LIV Golf and its disruption to the sport. After news of the merger broke, Chamblee spoke about the matter and expressed his displeasure with the PGA Tour.\n\n\"After the shock sort of ebbed away, I was hugely disappointed,\" Chamblee said Tuesday during an appearance on the Golf Channel. \"I think this is one of the saddest days in the history of professional golf. I do believe the governing bodies, the entities, have sacrificed their principles for profit.\"\n\nChamblee said he suspected there were three key reasons behind the decision to merge: legal issues over previously-pending antitrust litigation; \"entanglements\" some PGA Tour sponsors have with PIF capital; and the sheer amount of Saudi money that became available to the PGA Tour with the merger.\n\nWhat do we know about the terms of the merger agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf?\n\nThere are still several key details that are unknown about the merger. For starters, the new entity does not have a name yet.\n\nA key element in the merger is financial. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established board of directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments. PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will be part of the new entity's board of directors and will be on its executive committee. The announcement of the full board will come at a later date.\n\nAdditionally, the merger will lead to \"a mutually agreed end to all pending litigation between the participating parties.\" In August 2022, a number of golfers who joined the LIV tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions.\n\nThe merger stipulates that after the conclusion of the 2023 season, the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour \"will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process\" to allow players who left the PGA Tour and DP tour to re-apply for membership.\n\nLIV Golf only part of Saudi 'sportswashing'\n\nIt's not just golf that is being upended by Saudi money.\n\nIn addition to financing Tuesday's merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced this week that it has effectively seized controlling stakes in four of the largest teams in the country's pro soccer league, in an effort to lure top European talent there.\n\nFreelance reporter Fabrizio Romano reported for The Guardian on Tuesday that the one of those teams, Al-Ittihad, is signing Real Madrid star Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante of Chelsea, each for exorbitant sums. Benzema is due to make roughly $213 million per year over two seasons, according to Romano, while Kante's contract is reported to be in excess of $106 million per year.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is making more than $200 million per year with another Saudi team, Al-Nassr, and Romano reports that Lionel Messi has been offered more than $370 million to play for Al-Hilal. The PIF also owns Newcastle United, a prominent English team.\n\nActivists and academics have pointed to the PIF's investment in soccer and golf as part of a broader campaign of Saudi \"sportswashing,\" or using sports to polish a country's otherwise problematic reputation. Saudi Arabia has a track record of human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. — Tom Schad\n\nU.S. Senators call out PGA Tour for 'hypocrisy' over merger with LIV Golf\n\nTwo United States senators took to social media on Tuesday to address the monster news that the PGA Tour was merging with LIV Golf.\n\nOregon’s Ron Wyden, who serves as the chairman of the Committee on Finance, blasted the deal, vowing to explore its economic impact. The merger means that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will be backing professional golf stateside and abroad.\n\n\"Hypocrisy doesn’t begin to describe this brazen, shameless cash grab,\" he said on Twitter. \"I’m going to dive into every piece of Saudi Arabia’s deal with the PGA. U.S. officials need to consider whether a deal will give the Saudi regime inappropriate control or access to U.S. real estate.\"\n\nConnecticut’s Chris Murphy expressed surprise at the deal. He said representatives from the PGA recently visited his office and were upset at the track record of social justice violations by the Middle Eastern country.\n\n\"So weird. PGA officials were in my office just months ago talking about how the Saudis' human rights record should disqualify them from having a stake in a major American sport,\" he said while retweeting a news post of the unification.\n\n\"I guess maybe their concerns weren't really about human rights?\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhat was Phil Mickelson's LIV Golf deal worth?\n\nAlthough Phil Mickelson has not revealed the exact amount of his signing bonus to join the LIV tour, it was widely expected that his deal exceeded the $125 million figure that fellow golfer Dustin Johnson took. Reports later emerged that Mickelson's contract was worth $200 million, which was the largest contract issued by the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nLIV Golf, PGA Tour merger shines spotlight on 'sportswashing'\n\nOver the past six years, the term has been used to describe everything from the 2018 World Cup in Russia to a 2019 heavyweight boxing match in Saudi Arabia to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAnd at a news conference ahead of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league's first event last summer, it came up twice.\n\n\"Isn't there a danger,\" one reporter asked Phil Mickelson, \"that you're also being seen as a tool of sportswashing?\"\n\nThat term — \"sportswashing\" — is still relatively new. But the strategy it represents has been employed by governments around the world, in some form or fashion, for a century or more.\n\nFor world leaders, it is a way to improve their nation's reputation by hosting a prestigious sporting event, or financing a popular team. — Tom Schad\n\nWhat is going on with the antitrust lawsuit filed against the PGA Tour?\n\nIn August 2022, 11 players who left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf filed an antitrust lawsuit to challenge their suspensions from the PGA Tour.\n\nThis followed a report from the month before that the United States Department of Justice was investigating the PGA Tour for possible anticompetitive behavior. Augusta National Golf Club, which operates the Masters Tournament, the United States Golf Association and the PGA of America were later revealed to also be part of the investigation.\n\nSince then, lawyers on both sides have battled in various court proceedings to gain leverage. With the merger, however, both sides are mutually agreeing to end all pending litigation against the other.\n\nWho is on the PGA Tour board of directors?\n\nJay Monahan is currently serving as the PGA Tour commissioner and will retain a large presence after the merger. Ed Herlihy is serving as the 2023 PGA Tour policy board chairman and the co-chair of the board of directors. Jimmy Dunne is acting as the vice chair and senior managing principal on this year's board of directors. Under the merger, however, the board of the new entity will look a little different.\n\nAccording to the news release, PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will serve as chairman. Al-Rumayyan will also join the PGA Tour's policy board and will be part of the board of directors' executive committee. Monahan will serve as the CEO of the board of directors.\n\nAl-Rumayyan, Monahan, Herlihy and Dunne will all serve on the executive committee of the board.\n\n9/11 families group slams PGA Tour over LIV Golf merger: 'Paid Saudi shills'\n\nAn organization representing families of 9/11 victims ripped the PGA Tour's decision Tuesday to merge with Saudi-funded LIV Golf, describing the PGA and its commissioner, Jay Monahan, as hypocrites who have become \"paid Saudi shills.\"\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, 9/11 Families United said it was \"shocked and deeply offended\" by the news of the merger, which will see the PGA, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour all operating under a single business umbrella, funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The chair of 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, said she and the other family members who make up the group felt \"betrayed\" by the PGA Tour and Monahan individually.\n\n\"Mr. Monahan talked last summer about knowing people who lost loved ones on 9/11, then wondered aloud on national television whether LIV Golfers ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour. They do now — as does he,\" said Strada, whose husband, Tom, died at the World Trade Center.\n\n\"PGA Tour leaders should be ashamed of their hypocrisy and greed. Our entire 9/11 community has been betrayed by Commissioner Monahan and the PGA as it appears their concern for our loved ones was merely window-dressing in their quest for money — it was never to honor the great game of golf.\" — Tom Schad\n\nThe White House is staying out of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf partnership\n\nAs news of the PGA Tour's merger with LIV Golf spread, the White House is opting not to weigh in, when reporters at a briefing asked about the agreement in light of Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"I have no comment on that,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday during a briefing. — Joey Garrison\n\nAs PGA Tour and LIV announce merger, the current standings and top players on each tour\n\nLIV golfers Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson have been hard to miss near the top of major tournament leaderboards this year – especially with Koepka collecting his fifth major at the PGA Championship.\n\nBut what about all the other players who left the PGA for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour in past months?\n\nWith the surprise announcement Tuesday morning of the merger of the two tours' business operations, here's a look at the top 52 players of each tour in 2023. — Jim Sergent\n\nTune in for 'Full Swing' Season 2\n\nA producer on the Netflix docuseries \"Full Swing,\" which follows the lives of several men's pro golfers, said that the cameras were rolling when the news of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf agreement came through.\n\n\"You better believe we were filming when this broke,\" producer Chad Mumm wrote Tuesday in a tweet.\n\nSeason 2 drops in 2024.\n\nPGA Tour golfers frustrated they didn't know about deal with LIV Golf beforehand\n\nThe golf world was stunned by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf deal, and apparently, so were the ones on the tours.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday morning was a shocker since the PGA Tour and its players have been critical of the LIV Golf Invitational Series, primarily because it is funded entirely by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, which has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners.\n\nWhen the announcement was made, PGA Tour golfers voiced their displeasure on Twitter with how they found out about the deal, with many saying that they found out through social media. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Nicklaus says PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger 'good for the game of golf'\n\nJack Nicklaus is thankful the infighting is coming to a close.\n\nNicklaus, who said he was offered but turned down $100 million to be the CEO of the LIV Golf series and said LIV Golf \"wasn't for me,\" reacted to the stunning news that the PGA Tour and LIV Golf will merge.\n\n“The last three years have been difficult for the game and the players,\" said Nicklaus, who lives in North Palm Beach. \"I spoke with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan this morning. He seemed pleased with the arrangement that will once again bring together the best players in the world. I agree that this is good for the game of golf.\"\n\nThis came just one week after Nicklaus spoke ahead of the Memorial Tournament about the LIV players who had decided to split off from the PGA Tour.\n\n“I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore,\" he said then. \"I don’t mean that in a nasty way. This is a PGA Tour event, and we have the best field we can possibly have for a PGA Tour event for those who are eligible to be here. The other guys made a choice of what they did and where they’ve gone and we don’t even talk about it.\" — Tom D'Angelo, Palm Beach Post\n\nAugusta National, Royal and Ancient weigh in on merger\n\nFred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, which is the home of the Masters, said the club is \"encouraged\" by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger, and said it \"represents a positive development in bringing harmony to men’s professional golf.\"\n\nRidley added that August and the Masters are \"devoted to developing the game and celebrating its many virtues.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Martin Slumbers, the CEO of R&A, said the club was \"pleased that an agreement has been reached which will help men’s professional golf move forward in a collaborative, constructive and innovative fashion. ...\n\n\"We care deeply about golf’s future and are committed to ensuring that the sport continues to thrive for many years to come,\" Slumbers continued. \"This agreement represents a hugs step toward achieving that goal for golf and we look forward to working with the new entity for the benefit of the sport globally.\" — Casey Moore\n\nOPINION: PGA Tour sold out to LIV Golf and the Saudis. Pro golf will never be the same.\n\nFrauds, all of them. But frauds now united in the only thing that actually matters to the world of professional golf: Making money.\n\nIn the end, it didn’t actually matter to PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan that the money came from a country, Saudi Arabia, that treats human rights like an inconvenience. The tradition and history of the PGA Tour, in fact, didn’t matter all that much to those who argued that LIV Golf was an unworthy, unserious rival whose guaranteed money and 54-hole events were mocking competition.\n\nAnd as for the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Greg Norman, they did not, in fact, care all that much about growing the game. They wanted to own it. Now they do: The PGA Tour, brought to you by Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.\n\nThey sold out. Professional golf will never be the same.\n\nRead the rest of Dan Wolken's column here.\n\nJay Monahan, Yasir Al-Rumayyan discuss PGA Tour and LIV Golf merger on CNBC\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan sat down for a joint interview on CNBC on Tuesday morning to discuss the merger news that rocked the golf world.\n\nMonahan called it a historic day.\n\n\"There’s been a lot of tension in our sport over the last couple of years,\" Monahan said, \"but what we’re talking about today is coming together to unify the game of golf and to do so under one umbrella.\"\n\nConversations began in London over golf and lunch, said Al-Rumayyan, who noted that had the two tours met two or three years ago for those same discussions, the impact on the game would not have been as significant.\n\n\"Because it would be something small,\" he continued. \"But the way we’re doing our partnership, it’s going to be really big, in many senses.\"\n\nAl-Rumayyan said the PIF is committed to investing \"whatever it takes\" to ensure success, later noting that they wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t think it would be profitable.\n\n\"If you look at the size of golf, monetary-wise, it’s about $100 billion today,\" said Al-Rumayyan. \"And I think the growth, it’s there. I think working together we can have a faster growth rate than it was for the past 10 or 20 years.\" — Casey Moore\n\nPGA Tour will retain oversight over tour\n\nAs part of the agreement, PGA Tour Inc. will remain in place as a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, which means it will continue to have oversight over its tour. During an interview with CNBC, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan offered more insight into the breakdown and Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan confirmed that PIF is prepared to invest billions.\n\n\"The c6 still stays in place and out of the c6 we’ll continue to operate our tours,\" Monahan said. \"We’ll put our player retirement plans and assets there. So that stays in place. One of the things that’s important to both of us is every single week we’re playing tournaments, we’re making a huge impact on the communities where we’re invited guests. That continues.\n\n\"At the c6 level — you take the assets of the PGA Tour, the PIF assets, and LIV and the Asian Tour and the DP World Tour, take all of those commercial assets and drop them down into that for-profit LLC … we’re going to go through an evaluation of all of the businesses and the PIF will invest … there will be additional investment and growth initiatives. That’s what’s really exciting here.\" — Casey Moore\n\nWhat has former U.S. President Donald Trump said about LIV Golf?\n\nDuring a pro-am event at his Trump National Golf Club May 25, Trump praised LIV Golf and defended his business relationship with the controversial Saudi-funded tour.\n\n\"They've been great for golf. The Saudis have been fantastic for golf,” Trump said then. “And they're going to make it a big part of, inside their country, they're going to do some great courses.\"\n\nLIV Golf also has upcoming stops scheduled at Trump courses in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Miami, Florida, later this year.\n\nAfter the news Tuesday, Trump celebrated the merger on his Truth Social platform, according to CNBC. “Great news from LIV Golf. A big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf. Congrats to all!!!”\n\nIs the PGA Tour a nonprofit?\n\nWhile the merger announced the creation of \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity,\" the PGA Tour is retaining its position as \"a 501(c)(6) tax exempt organization.\"\n\nThe difference with the merger, however, is that — in the threat of continued disruption in men's professional golf — the PGA Tour reversed course and is aligning with the massive influx of Saudi capital.\n\nIn an interview on CBS in June 2022, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan ripped the LIV tour over links between the Saudi government and the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the interview, Monahan spoke about players who joined LIV Golf needing to apologize to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and asked: \"Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?\"\n\nWhat is LIV Golf?\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational Series made its debut in June 2022 after the tour lured some notable players from the PGA Tour such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Others like Brooks Koepka, the winner of the most recent PGA Championship, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith have since joined. The LIV tour presented a disruption in the dynamics of the sport.\n\nThe format of play of the tour also presented a shakeup to the PGA Tour.\n\nEvents were designed as 54-hole, three-round, no-cut competitions. LIV Golf incorporated shotgun starts to expedite play. Players were split into four-person teams. Purses were divided between individual placement and team placement, offering players more financial incentives to participate.\n\nWhat has Phil Mickelson said about the PGA Tour merger with LIV Golf?\n\nThough he has not made public comments yet, Mickelson, one of the most high-profile players on the LIV tour, posted a message on Twitter to celebrate the news of the merger.\n\n\"Awesome day today 😊,\" he wrote.\n\nWhy is LIV Golf so controversial?\n\nThe LIV tour drew criticism because it is funded entirely by the PIF, the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\nWhat has been Tiger Woods' stance on LIV Golf?\n\nIn May 2022, Tiger Woods reaffirmed his commitment to the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Phil has said some things that I think a lot of us who are committed to the Tour and committed to the legacy of the Tour have pushed back against, and he's taken some personal time, and we all understand that,\" Woods said ahead of the 2022 PGA Championship. \"Some of his views on how the Tour could be run, should be run, been a lot of disagreement there.

If LIV went away tomorrow, I’d be super happy.”\n\nWhat is the timeline of how LIV Golf got started?\n\nLIV Golf first teed off last June after rattling the golf world with the news that it would offer players larger purses backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. The inaugural tournament was held in London and then the tour traveled to its first stateside event in Portland.\n\nDustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Sergio García were among the leading PGA Tour players to leave for LIV. The PGA suspended the players for participating in the new series.\n\nLIV Golf was met with much criticism from Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and others for accepting support from a country with a history of human rights violations and for breaking tradition.\n\nAt the end of the first LIV Golf season, Johnson was crowned the champion, earning a prize of $18 million.\n\nIn January, LIV Golf signed a broadcast deal with CW Network to air 14 events of the 2023 season.\n\nA month later, the PGA invited LIV golfers to participate in the Masters.

For starters, the new entity does not have a name yet.\n\nA key element in the merger is financial. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established Board of Directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments. PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will be part of the new entity's Board of Directors and will be on its executive committee. The announcement of the full board will come at a later date.\n\nAdditionally, the merger will lead to \"a mutually agreed end to all pending litigation between the participating parties.\" In August 2022, a number of golfers who joined the LIV tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions.\n\nThe merger stipulates that after the conclusion of the 2023 season, the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour \"will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process\" to allow players who left the PGA Tour and DP tour to re-apply for membership.\n\nWhat does the merger with LIV Golf mean for the PGA Tour?\n\nWhile the merger announced the creation of \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity,\" the PGA Tour is retaining its position as \"a 501(c)(6) tax exempt organization.\"\n\nThe difference with the merger, however, is that — in the threat of continued disruption in men's professional golf — the PGA Tour reversed course and is aligning with the massive influx of Saudi capital.\n\nIn an interview on CBS in June 2022, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan ripped the LIV tour over links between the Saudi government and the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the interview, Monahan spoke about players who joined LIV Golf needing to apologize to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and asked: \"Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?\"\n\nWhat does the merger mean for the 2024 PGA Championship at Louisville's Valhalla Golf Club?\n\nIt's too early to tell how majors such as the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville will be impacted by the merger as the terms of agreement are finalized in the months to come.\n\nGolfers who made the switch to LIV were allowed to compete in the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York, as long as they met the following eligibility requirements:\n\nAll former winners of the PGA Championship\n\nWinners of the last five Masters (2019-23)\n\nWinners of the last five U.S. Opens (2018-22)\n\nWinners of the last five Open Championships (2017-22)\n\nWinners of the last three THE PLAYERS Championships (2021-23)\n\nThe top three on the OWGR’s International Federation Ranking List as of April 24, 2023\n\nWinner of 2022 Senior PGA Championship\n\nThe top 15 finishers and ties from the 2022 PGA Championship\n\nThe top 20 finishers from the 2023 PGA Professional Championship\n\nThe top 70 players who are eligible and have earned the most PGA Championship points from the 2022 AT&T Byron Nelson through the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship (ending May 7, 2023)\n\nPlaying members of the last named U.S. and European Ryder Cup teams (2021), provided they remain in the top 100 on the Official World Golf Rankings as of May 7, 2023\n\nWinners of PGA TOUR co-sponsored or approved tournaments whose victories are considered official, from the 2022 Charles Schwab Challenge through the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson\n\nTickets on sale:Here's how to get tickets for the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla\n\nEighteen LIV golfers qualified for the 2023 PGA Championship: Brooks Keopka; Phil Mickelson; Martin Kaymer; Dustin Johnson; Joaquin Niemann; Talor Gooch; Patrick Reed; Harold Varner III; Dean Burmester; Anirban Lahiri; Mito Pereira; Abraham Ancer; Brendan Steele; Cameron Smith; Bryson DeChambeau; Sihwan Kim and Paul Casey.\n\nThe 2024 PGA Championship is scheduled for next May.

PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan was at the Canadian Open that week and said pointedly about any player who joined LIV or was thinking about it: “Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?”\n\nNow they are partners, giving Saudi Arabia a commercial voice in golf’s premier organization.\n\n“I recognize everything I’ve said in the past. I recognize people will call me a hypocrite,\" Monahan said in a conference call Tuesday evening. \"Any time I’ve said anything, I’ve said it with the information I had, and I said it with someone trying to compete with our tour and our players.”\n\nMost PGA Tour players were bewildered by the shocking turnaround. It didn't help that a news outlet broke the embargoed announcement before Monahan could send a memo to the players. Most learned of the development on social media.\n\n“I love finding out about morning news on Twitter,” two-time major champion Collin Morikawa tweeted.\n\nMany were not happy. Wesley Bryan tweeted, “I feel betrayed, and will not ... be able to trust anyone within the corporate structure of the PGA Tour for a very long time.”\n\nByeong Hun An added on Twitter: “I’m guessing the liv teams were struggling to get sponsors and pga tour couldn’t turn down the money. Win-win for both tours but it’s a big lose for who defended the tour for last two years.”\n\n“They were going down their path, we were going down ours, and after a lot of introspection you realize all this tension in the game is not a good thing,” Monahan said in a phone interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“We have a responsibility to our tour and to the game, and we felt like the time was right to have that conversation.”\n\nMonahan held a player meeting at the Canadian Open, though most top players are not there. He described the meeting as “intense, certainly heated.”\n\nAnd while this likely will only lead to greater riches in golf, there still was explaining to do on why the tour would merge with a group that tried to take away some of the PGA Tour's best players and was seen as the latest example of “sportswashing.”\n\nThe deal was in the works for the last seven weeks, when Monahan first met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund. Players typically approve changes to the schedule and other competition matters. On this one, they were left out.\n\n“No one had word of this,” Monahan said. “Our players expect us to operate in the best interests of the tour.”\n\nInstead, he cited guidance from corporate members of the PGA Tour board.\n\nStill, Monahan has his toughest work ahead of him.\n\nHe sought loyalty from his players against a league accused of taking part in sportswashing, an attempt by Saudi Arabia to shift focus away from its human rights abuses, such as the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNow the very group that posed such a threat is the commercial partner of the PGA Tour and European tour.\n\n“The divisiveness is now over, and two years of disruption and distractions ... is over and now we can concentrate on building our respective tours,” said Keith Pelley, CEO of the European tour. “And we are building it with PIF, who is clearly committed to the game.”\n\nAlong the way, PGA Tour players also got rich. The tour raised prize money at elite events to $20 million, the same purse for LIV’s individual competition. The 2024 schedule has been reshaped for roughly 16 tournaments like that.\n\n“In the short term, I expect a lot of questions and criticism,” Monahan said. “In the long run, players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways.”\n\nThe agreement combines the Public Investment Fund's golf-related commercial businesses and rights — including LIV Golf — with those of the PGA and European tours. The new entity has not been named.\n\nAl-Rumayyan will join the board of the PGA Tour, which continues to operates its tournaments. The PIF will invest in the commercial venture.\n\n“From the very beginning, the whole initiative was how to grow the game of golf,” Al-Rumayyan said. “And I think what was achieved today was exactly that.”\n\nAugusta National and the Royal & Ancient welcomed the news because it ends a bitter feud. Augusta National said the deal “represents a positive development in bringing harmony to men's professional golf.” R&A CEO Martin Slumbers said it would help golf “move forward in a collaborative, constructive and innovative fashion.”\n\nAs for the new role of Greg Norman, Al-Rumayyan said only that Norman is LIV Golf's commissioner and details of his future role would be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nMonahan's memo to players indicated a strong Saudi Arabian presence. He said PIF would make a financial investment to become a “premier corporate sponsor” of the PGA Tour, the European tour and other international tours.\n\nThe PIF initially will be the exclusive investor in the new entity and will have the exclusive right to further invest, including a right of first refusal on any capital that may be invested.\n\nAl-Rumayyan has been spotted wearing a “MAGA” hat during LIV events at courses owned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump predicted last July that a merger was inevitable and said anyone not signing with the Saudi league would be losing out. He weighed in Tuesday and called it a “glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf.”\n\nMonahan said the merger came together the last seven weeks, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne responsible for bringing together Monahan and Al-Rumayyan. Dunne and Ed Herlihy, chairman of the PGA Tour's board, will serve on the board of the commercial venture.\n\nPhil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau were among 11 players who filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour last August. LIV joined as plaintiffs, and the PGA Tour countersued.\n\nThe concern for PIF was whether its leaders could be deposed, which Saudi Arabia wanted to avoid. Being open to depositions would leave the kingdom's leaders more vulnerable to legal action, including lawsuits demanding they reveal business deals in the United States.\n\nA federal judge had ruled the PIF could not claim immunity from the Foreign Service Immunity Act because of its commercial work with LIV Golf in the U.S.\n\nThe PIF appealed the ruling to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which was likely to extend the lawsuit deep into 2024 if not longer.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington and AP Sports Writer Steve Douglas in Stockholm contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/golf/961173/pga-tour-liv-shock-merger-winners-losers-golf", "title": "PGA Tour-LIV shock merger: golf's big winners and losers | The ...", "text": "It was an announcement that shocked the world of golf. After a bitter civil war, the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf series revealed yesterday that a “landmark agreement” had been reached to “unify the game of golf” on a “global basis”. The parties have agreed that the “golf-related” commercial businesses and rights of the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), including LIV Golf, will be “combined” with those of the PGA and DP World tours into a “new, collectively owned, for-profit entity”. Following two years of “disruption and distraction”, this is “a historic day for the game we all know and love”, said Jay Monahan, commissioner of the PGA Tour. Keith Pelley, chief executive of the DP World Tour (formerly the European Tour), described it as a “momentous day”, while PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said the partnership “represents the best opportunity to extend and increase the impact of golf for all”. Former US president Donald Trump, who has hosted LIV competitions at his golf courses, “hailed the deal” on his Truth Social platform, said the Financial Times. Trump posted that it was a “big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf”. How the golf pundits reacted The formation of an “industry powerhouse” is “expected to transform the sport”, said Alan Blinder in The New York Times. It all “came together so quickly” that the new entity “does not yet even have a name”. However, it will be controlled by the PGA Tour and “significantly financed” by the PIF, the sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Al-Rumayyan will be the new company’s chairman and Monahan will be CEO. When yesterday’s email “dropped” it was like “reading an April Fools’ Day spoof”, said Iain Carter, the BBC’s golf correspondent. The notion of the established golf tours “harmoniously joining forces” with the “breakaway” LIV circuit was “so far-fetched”. While there is “now peace between rival factions”, there will “still be plenty of turmoil ahead”. Skip advert There are “plenty of questions left unanswered” following the announcement, which “rocked the sports world and the golf landscape”, said Kyle Porter on CBS Sports. In his 11 years of covering professional golf, “no single piece of news has been more shocking”.\n\nWith golf fans, pundits and officials still digesting the fallout of the shock merger, we break down the winners and losers from the sport’s unification. Winners: the breakaway LIV players When LIV Golf launched in 2022 it was able to “lure some of golf’s biggest names away” from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour by offering “staggering sums of money”, said Sky Sports. Stars who joined the breakaway included Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia and Ian Poulter. This year’s LIV schedule will “continue as planned”, but golfers who were “suspended indefinitely” by the PGA and DP World tours will be able to “re-apply for membership” from the end of the 2023 season. Mickelson and the other LIV golfers “who got paid” are winners from the “blockbuster” deal, said Tim Crean on ClutchPoints. It seems as though all these players will come back to the “now-larger Tour” and “be able to compete as they had in the past”. The “only real difference” is that the superstars who jumped ship “are now nine figures richer”. Mickelson called it an “awesome day” on Twitter. Losers: the loyal PGA players “Stunned” PGA loyalists who “rejected lucrative paydays” to snub the Saudi-backed series “must be sick”, said Daniel Davis in the Daily Mail. Ultimately, “household names” opted to remain on the PGA Tour, “even in spite of the eye-watering packages” being tabled by LIV. Golf icon and 15-time major winner Tiger Woods turned down between $700 and $800m (£575m-£650m) to switch, according to LIV chief Greg Norman. Rory McIlroy is said to have declined £400m and Jon Rahm “waved away” £321m, Davis added. McIlroy and Woods had “established themselves as the biggest supporters” of the PGA Tour in its battle with LIV Golf, said Sky Sports. However, “both were kept in the dark” about the stunning deal. Winners: Saudi Arabia The PGA’s merger with LIV “can’t be seen as anything other than a Saudi victory”, said Ewan Murray in The Guardian. “Forget the talk of released tension”, this deal is “merely a depressing illustration that money can disrupt and distort everything in sport”. Skip advert This victory for Saudi Arabia is “another sign that money can overwhelm almost any other force in sports”, said David Leonhardt in The New York Times. As part of the deal, the Saudi investment fund will “have the right of first refusal for future investments in the tour, allowing it to expand its stake”. Losers: Jay Monahan and Greg Norman PGA Tour boss Monahan accepts that he will be labelled a “hypocrite” as he had previously ruled out any merger. And after also admitting that players could be compensated for turning down millions to join LIV, Monahan is facing “calls to resign”, said Sky Sports. Following a “contentious” players’ meeting, Tour Advisory Council member Johnson Wagner revealed there were “many moments” where certain players were “calling for new leadership” of the PGA Tour and “even got a couple of standing ovations”.\n\nAnother official whose role is expected to be under threat is Greg Norman. The Australian has been a “divisive figurehead” as chief executive of LIV, but the former world No.1 “was not mentioned” during the official announcement, said Ben Collins on BBC Sport. In the 973-word statement, “none of these shocking words were Greg, or Norman”, Jacob Polychronis added on Fox Sports. Having fought a “bitter crusade” as the “frontman” of LIV for nearly two years, Norman’s omission was “curious”. “Chewed up” and “spat out”, he became a “pawn” in golf’s great war “and still lost”. Winners: sportswashing The term “sportswashing” means “the use of games and teams and stadiums to cleanse an image and launder a reputation”, said Jon Wertheim on CBS News. A country that has “never won an Olympic gold medal”, Saudi Arabia has “suddenly emerged as a major player in global sport” – hosting events, buying teams, and luring athletes with “staggering” contracts. PIF already owns Premier League club Newcastle United and in recent years has “poured billions into one-off spectacles” for individual sports, said DJ Dunson on Deadspin. The impending golf merger has brought Saudi sportswashing efforts to an American pro sport and is their “boldest foothold into the American market yet”. This is a “gigantic victory” for sportswashing, said Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. He told The Guardian that “in fact, it is the biggest sportswashing win that any authoritarian regime has ever had”. The PIF have “effectively bought the whole of international golf in one swoop”. Skip advert “Sportswashing works, kids,” said Murray in The Guardian. The cost of this chapter is to “the tune of several billion dollars”, which is “chump change” to the PIF. Losers: human rights The PGA Tour has rolled out a “blood-red carpet” for the Saudis and LIV Golf, said Dave Zirin on MSNBC. The tour and its commissioner have “suddenly decided to ignore all the negative implications” that he said would come with working with Saudi Arabia. As recently as Monday, the “official position” of the PGA Tour was that its competitor was a “scandalous, even odious, operation”, said Zirin. Referring to Saudi Arabia’s horrific human rights record, Monahan said last June: “You’d have to be living under a rock to not understand the implications of involving yourself with the Saudis.” Monahan’s “strong comment” is now “just a reminder that pencils have erasers”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/08/jimmy-dunne-pga-tour-liv-golf-merger-participation/70301457007/", "title": "Jimmy Dunne explains why he got involved in PGA Tour-LIV Golf ...", "text": "The deal that could fundamentally reshape the world of professional golf had a simple beginning: PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne said he reached out to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, via WhatsApp.\n\n\"I thought it made sense to understand who he was and what he was trying to do, and what his view was for the game of golf,\" Dunne told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview Thursday morning. \"And I went to meet him.\"\n\nNearly two months later, that initial reachout culminated in a stunning announcement Tuesday from the PGA Tour and Saudi-funded LIV Golf. After more than a year of acrimony and a pricey legal fight, the two golfing entities agreed to join the Europe-based DP World Tour under a singular corporate umbrella, led by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan but funded by the PIF, which is effectively the financial arm of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nThe deal drew immediate backlash from PGA Tour players, many of whom remained loyal to the tour last year despite receiving lucrative overtures from LIV. And it's been heavily criticized by human rights activists and some members of Congress, who view the PIF's involvement as a clear example of \"sportswashing\" − an attempt by the Saudis to use sports to polish their international reputation and draw attention away from their human rights abuses.\n\nDunne, the vice chairman and senior managing principal at investment banking firm Piper Sandler, played a key role in the negotiations, along with PGA Tour board chairman Ed Herlihy.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nDunne is a familiar face in the game, someone who is a member at Augusta National and friendly with several tour pros. He was appointed to the PGA Tour's policy board in November.\n\nHe said Thursday that he was cognizant of how the deal would be perceived, including by PGA Tour players, but his primary focus was \"trying to do something that would benefit the game of golf.\"\n\n\"I went on the board hoping that I could be part of a solution,\" said Dunne, 66. \"Everyone will have their own point of view. I’m confident that what we came up with is the best long-term for the game. It's true. That’s it. I’m not trying to get more shares of this company. ... I'm not trying to make anybody look bad or good. I’m just dealing with the facts, as we have them. And I’m trying to find a way that we can go forward, positively.\"\n\nThe fact that Dunne made the initial reachout to the PIF came as a surprise to many, given the personal tragedy he experienced on Sept. 11, 2001. His firm was based in offices on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower, and 66 of his coworkers died in the terrorist attack that day − including his longtime friend Christopher Quackenbush and mentor Herman Sandler. Dunne would have been there, too, had he not decided to go to an area golf course in an attempt to qualify for the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship.\n\nGiven that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the attack were Saudi nationals, groups like 9/11 Families United have been extremely critical of sports groups like LIV taking Saudi money.\n\nWhen asked about what he would say to people who are having trouble squaring his involvement in the deal and his experience on 9/11, Dunne said he believes golf is \"a force for good.\" He said what happened on 9/11 is still the first thing he thinks about every morning, the last thing he thinks about every night and something that crosses his mind in several moments in between.\n\n\"But my guys − Chris Quackenbush, Herman Sandler, those guys − thinking about it and remembering it will not be enough for them. They would want me to do something about it,\" Dunne said. \"And to the degree that we can reach out to people that are different than us (and) share experiences, we might be reducing the chances of some other thing happening, that’s equally horrific, down the road.\n\n\"So it isn’t a matter of just remembering. My guys are going to want me to remember − and act. So the game of golf, to the degree we can use it, can be a really important gift.\"\n\nDunne likened the sport, at another point, to a bridge between people. And he said he believes all the parties involved in Tuesday's deal \"wanted to do good and loves the game of golf.\"\n\nWhen asked what gives him confidence that those intentions are genuine and that golf is not being used as a form of \"sportswashing\" by the PIF, Dunne said: \"I believe that, based on the people I’ve met with, the multiple times I’ve been with them, the golf we played with each other. That’s my belief.\"\n\nDunne spoke generally about the PGA Tour's deal with LIV Golf in the context of the broader golfing ecosystem. Ultimately, he said, he wanted to stop the \"distractions and unpleasantness\" that have run through the sport over the past few years. He said he wants the sport to be more accessible to more people around the world.\n\nWill Tuesday's deal accomplish that?\n\n\"I know it will,\" Dunne said, \"if we can all move forward.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/02/16/comcast-time-warner-cable-merger-tellusatoday-your-say/5536401/", "title": "Cable merger can create headache for customers: #tellusatoday", "text": "Comcast announced last week that it wants to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45 billion.

The companies own dozens of chains, including Safeway, Vons, Harris Teeter and Fred Meyer and reach a combined 85 million households.\n\nKroger (KR) and Albertsons, which both employ mostly union workforces, want to merge to be more competitive against non-union giants such as Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). The grocers are also facing increased pressure from Aldi, the fast-growing German discount supermarket chain.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger could reshape the grocery industry. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThere’s no guarantee the deal will go through, however.\n\nThe merger will face intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators. Opponents, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have already called on regulators to block the deal. The companies say they will divest hundreds of stores in areas where they overlap to win regulatory approval.\n\nHere’s how the mega-merger could impact grocery shopping in America.\n\nLower prices…for now\n\nPrices at the grocery store are a major concern for shoppers right now.\n\nGrocery prices increased 13% in September over the last year, the fastest pace in decades.\n\nThe companies say that they will be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They will also invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, including on lowering prices.\n\n“Our expanded portfolio, along with more personalized promotions and benefits, will help customers save… and help to relieve the inflationary pressures facing shoppers across the country,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday.\n\nAlbertsons stores are concentrated more on the West Coast, while Kroger is dominant in the Midwest.\n\nAlbertsons has higher prices than Kroger and other grocers, analysts say, and they predict Kroger will try to reduce Albertsons prices to be more competitive against discount chains like Aldi.\n\n“This deal could provide some food pricing relief for consumers,” said Ken Fenyo, a retail analyst at Coresight Research. “With Aldi, Lidl and other discount grocers coming in, this positions Kroger to drive the market forward.”\n\nBut supermarket mergers can also lead to higher prices for shoppers.\n\nA 2012 study published in the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy found that “mergers in the supermarket industry can result in significant increases in consumer prices and thereby harm consumers” in highly concentrated markets.\n\nMergers in less concentrated markets are most often associated with price decreases, the study found.\n\nAntitrust advocates say the merger would force out competition and concentrate power among the largest chains, driving up prices.\n\n“A Kroger-Albertons deal would squeeze consumers already struggling to afford food,” said Sarah Miller, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a policy group against concentrated economic power.\n\nMore store brands\n\nKroger and Albertsons have each been building out their own exclusive food brands in recent years as alternatives to big-name brands.\n\nKroger, for example, offers its own brands such as Private Selection and Simple Truth, while Albertsons has O Organics, Open Nature and others.\n\nThe two companies’ brands generated a combined $43 billion in sales last year.\n\nThis is an important strategy for these stores because it’s more profitable to sell their own brands than national labels, and it helps keep big brands’ prices in check.\n\nBy merging, the companies plan to expand their own brand selection and lower production costs.\n\nStore closures and pain for mom-and-pops\n\nGrocery stores in the United States are on the decline.\n\nThe number of US grocers fell by roughly 30% from 1993 to 2019, according to a report last year by Food & Water Watch, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nAnalysts say that Kroger and Albertsons are likely to close some of their overlapping stores, particularly in some cities where they are heavily concentrated, such as Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n“There will, no doubt, be some closures if a merger goes ahead,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. “Over time, the rate of closures may be more pronounced as the combined chains seek to minimize duplication,” he said.\n\nAdvocates fear the merger would harm small grocery stores. Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts and advocates also say that a merger would make it harder for smaller grocers and mom-and-pop stores to stay in business.\n\nThe National Grocers Association, which represents small retailers and wholesalers, said the merger would put smaller competitors at an “unfair disadvantage” and increase “anticompetitive buyer power over grocery suppliers.”\n\nThis would disproportionally hurt cities and rural areas, where independent stores are typically located.\n\n“This deal would almost certainly put more rural towns and Black and Latino neighborhoods in cities at risk of becoming ‘food deserts’ as more local grocers are driven out of business,” said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration.\n\nMerger frenzy\n\nThe food industry in America has consolidated in recent decades.\n\nThe top five grocers – Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Ahold Delhaize and Amazon – control about half the market, according to UBS.\n\nA Kroger-Albertsons merger would spark a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to keep up, analysts predict.\n\nThe proposed deal “accelerates the ongoing consolidation of the sector,” said UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser.\n\nAmazon “has aspirations to be larger in the space,” he said. “The warehouse clubs, hard discounters, strong [regional grocers] and specialty players will look to fortify their positions.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/media/cnn-shutting-down/index.html", "title": "CNN+ will shut down at the end of April | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCNN+, the streaming service that was hyped as one of the most significant developments in the history of CNN, will shut down on April 30, just one month after it launched.\n\nCNN+ customers “will receive prorated refunds of subscription fees,” the company said.\n\nThe decision was made by new management after CNN’s former parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery earlier this month.\n\nThe prior management team’s vision for CNN+ runs counter to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s plan to house all of the company’s brands under one streaming service. Some CNN+ programming may eventually live on through that service. Other programming will shift to CNN’s main television network.\n\n“In a complex streaming market, consumers want simplicity and an all-in service which provides a better experience and more value than stand-alone offerings, and, for the company, a more sustainable business model to drive our future investments in great journalism and storytelling,” Discovery’s streaming boss J.B. Perrette said in a statement.\n\n“We have very exciting opportunities ahead in the streaming space and CNN, one of the world’s premier reputational assets, will play an important role there,” Perrette added.\n\nPerrette and incoming CNN CEO Chris Licht notified staffers of the decision in a meeting on Thursday afternoon. Licht bluntly told employees it was a “uniquely shitty situation.”\n\nHundreds of CNN+ staffers may lose their jobs. Licht said in an internal memo that “all CNN+ employees will continue to be paid and receive benefits for the next 90 days to explore opportunities at CNN, CNN Digital and elsewhere in the Warner Bros. Discovery family.”\n\nStaffers who aren’t absorbed elsewhere in the company will receive a minimum of six months of severance, he added.\n\nAn agent for one CNN+ host, who was set to anchor a weekly show on the streaming service, described their client’s program at the network as facing an uncertain future. “It’s all TBD,” the person said.\n\nBut the agent added that the network has gone out of its way to make clear that it is committed to finding roles for CNN+ hosts.\n\nLicht said in a town hall style meeting with staffers that “this was an incredibly successful launch” but simply incompatible with the newly merged company’s plans.\n\n“It is not your fault that you had the rug pulled out from underneath you,” he said as he vowed to minimize the impacts to staff.\n\nOne CNN+ staffer at the town hall described the sentiment as “total and utter shock” that morphed into despair.\n\n“At first people were really freaking out,” explained the person, who requested anonymity to candidly describe the situation. “And then, toward the end of the meeting, it just turned to sadness. Every team was just huddling with each other.”\n\nDuring the town hall, Perrette expressed some frustration with the “prior leadership” of CNN, which was led by Jeff Zucker until February, and WarnerMedia, which was led by Jason Kilar until early April.\n\n“Some of this was avoidable,” he said, but “prior leadership decided to just keep going” with the planned March launch of CNN+ despite the impending merger, he said.\n\nThe streaming service ended up launching just two weeks before the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger completed, much to the exasperation of Discovery leadership, which had a different strategy but could not legally communicate with CNN executives before the deal was official.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has billions in debt, much of which is a result of the deal to combine the company, and executives are under pressure to find $3 billion in savings that Wall Street is expecting from them.\n\nThe executive vice president in charge of CNN+ and all of CNN’s digital businesses, Andrew Morse, who worked closely with Kilar and Zucker, will depart the company after a transition period.\n\nIn a note to employees, Morse described his nine years at CNN as an “incredible ride” and said, “As the company enters an exciting period of change, it’s clear that the vision the new leadership has for the future is different than the one we’ve had. That’s OK. That’s all part of change.”\n\nLicht said in the town hall that he wanted Morse to stay, but respected the decision.\n\nAlex MacCallum, the head of product and general manager of CNN+, will run CNN Digital and work with Licht “to determine a leadership strategy going forward,” the company said in a press release.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, CNN+ employees housed on the 16th floor of Hudson Yards, the network’s New York headquarters, broke out whiskey and wine to commiserate.\n\nThe decision to shut down CNN+ just weeks after it launched marked a stunning end to the streaming news service. Executives had touted the application as the most significant launch since Ted Turner founded CNN in 1980.\n\nCNN had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the new streaming app and lured top talent from other networks for it, including Kasie Hunt from NBC and Chris Wallace from Fox News.\n\nThe streaming service featured hours of daily live programming and weekly shows.\n\nThat programming will continue to stream through the end of the month.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy Brian Stelter", "Oliver Darcy", "Brian Stelter"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2014/04/10/revamped-pro-bowl-will-likely-hit-glendale/7538135/", "title": "Revamped Pro Bowl will likely be a hit in Glendale", "text": "Bob McManaman\n\nazcentral sports\n\nAnything the NFL wraps around its multibillion-dollar shield these days seems to turn into gold.\n\nIf the NFL decided to start packaging bologna, they'd probably outsell Oscar Mayer.\n\nIt's true. Football fans just can't get enough of the pro brand. That's why they tune in to watch anything and everything that is the NFL, be it college-aged men working out in their underwear at the scouting combine or prospects pretending that they're actually playing against somebody in their staged and scripted pro days leading up the draft, which has become a TV mega-ratings bonanza.\n\nThe NFL is so big that even the once laughable Pro Bowl is now an actual event many don't want to miss. It's been the most-watched all-star event among the four major professional sports for the past four years, and it's coming to the Valley next year.\n\nThe league formally announced Wednesday that the 2015 Pro Bowl will be played on Jan. 25 and televised live on ESPN from University of Phoenix Stadium — one week before Super Bowl XLIX is to be played there as well. Goody for Glendale.\n\nThe Pro Bowl will return to Hawaii in 2016 and 2017, but there are no commitments to Honolulu and Aloha Stadium beyond that.\n\n\"We're very excited about this,\" Cardinals President Michael Bidwill said. \"This is only the third time the game has been moved out of Hawaii, and it's the second time since the AFL-NFL merger (in 1970). … We think it's a great opportunity for our community. We've got a lot of things in place: the infrastructure, our tourism infrastructure, the stadium, and all the things we're doing around the Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's going to be a great, great event.\"\n\nThe Pro Bowl was left languishing for several years amid general disinterest — and because so many star players regularly decided to skip the game because of aches and pains and apparent apathy.\n\nLet's face it: A free trip to Hawaii wasn't exactly a dream vacation anymore for a rich football player who's been there, done that. Some players were just too tired to attend after a grueling 16-game regular season, in addition to the playoffs.\n\nThe Pro Bowl sank in popularity, always seemingly a distant fourth to the All-Star Games involving Major League Baseball, the NBA and even the NHL.\n\nIt got so bad that the NFL considered scrapping the event. It needed a facelift in the worst way.\n\nBidwill, who had been trying for the past couple of years to lure the game to Arizona, was among a contingent of NFL executives who flew to New York to meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell and discuss possible solutions.\n\nChanges have been made in recent years, though, including a big one involving this latest Pro Bowl by which the game was no longer AFC vs. the NFC, but rather an unconferenced selection process; players are picked by fans, coaches and fellow players.\n\nFor the first time, teammates actually lined up against each other, as was the case between the Cardinals' Larry Fitzgerald and Patrick Peterson.\n\nNearly 12 million viewers tuned in to watch.\n\nAdrian Peterson, the perennial Pro Bowl running back for the Minnesota Vikings, said the Pro Bowl was always a nice little postseason junket for him, but that it means more for younger players and not so much the veterans.\n\n\"But I think with the types of changes they've made, that's going to boost it up a little more,\" he told azcentral sports on Wednesday.\n\n\"Now guys get the opportunity to play with guys they'd probably never get to play with. Now you might be playing against your own teammate. I thought that was brilliant and I think that's something that's going to keep the athletes interested in it.\"\n\nIt worked this year. The 2014 Pro Bowl, competing directly with the Grammy Awards, drew 11.7 million viewers.\n\nThat's more than the All-Star Games for MLB (11 million), the NBA (8 million) and the NHL (1.3 million) from the 2012-13 seasons.\n\nBut then again, that's the NFL.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/10"}]}

In return, Bowen would hire Dawkins and Sood and sign with Adidas as a professional.\n\nBowen was suspended by Louisville and transferred to the University of South Carolina where he was eventually ruled ineligible by the NCAA for the 2018-2019 season \"based on alleged benefits received by the Bowen family at his former institution and his requirement to serve a transfer year in residence at South Carolina.\"\n\nBrian Bowen:'I'm a lot stronger mentally than I thought'\n\nDespite everything that’s happened, Bowen said he and his father still have a strong relationship.\n\n“Our relationship is even stronger than what it was before,” Bowen said. “He’s got me where I am today on the court and off the court.”\n\nIn Australia, Bowen played 15.4 minutes per game, averaged 6.3 points and shot 45.1% percent from the field.

That changed during the question-and-answer session at McDonald's annual shareholders meeting May 23, when the 9-year-old stood in front of a microphone and bawled out McDonald's CEO Don Thompson for marketing fast food to children. Sure, the 4th-grader from the city of Kelowna in British Columbia, got there with the backing of her nutritionally savvy parents as well as the activist group Corporate Accountability International. It picked up the family's travel expenses to Chicago, where the world's largest fast-food chain is based and where its annual meeting was held. But Hannah insists she wrote much of her own speech that has since gone viral on the Internet. Her first mass media interview, the day after the meeting, was with USA TODAY marketing reporter BRUCE HOROVITZ. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nQ. Why did you bawl out McDonald's CEO Don Thompson?\n\nA. Because I wanted to speak for all those kids and parents who wanted to have that voice and talk to McDonald's.\n\nQ. Can you sum up what you told him?\n\nA. I said it's not fair that big companies try to trick kids into eating food that's not good for them by giving them toys -- and with cartoon characters.\n\nQ. Do you think he heard what you said?\n\nA. Not very much. He kept saying the same thing: We sell veggies; and we want kids to eat healthy; and we don't sell junk food.\n\nQ. Was it scary to publicly address the CEO of one of America's biggest brands?\n\nA. It was very scary. I was shaking. I couldn't control my shaking, but no one could tell. So many people were there, and I was talking to the CEO of McDonald's. He's got a big reputation.\n\nQ. Who wrote your speech?\n\nA. Me and my mom wrote it together at home on the computer. It took about a day to write.\n\nQ. Who wrote the part of your speech that said that some things in life aren't fair, like when a pet dies -- or when a big company markets to kids.\n\nA. That was me. One of my pets recently died. It was a gerbil named \"Squeekers.\" I had him for two years. It didn't feel fair when he died -- it was sad. It's not fair that McDonald's markets to kids and that so many kids are getting sick because they eat junk food.\n\nQ. What's your biggest problem with McDonald's?\n\nA. My biggest problem with McDonald's is that they trick kids into eating their food by using toys and cartoon characters and sports icons.\n\nQ. What if they stopped all that?\n\nA. If they put more healthy food on their menu, I'd be OK with that. But when you think of the Golden Arches and McDonald's, you think of Big Macs, fries and nuggets.\n\nQ. How many times have you eaten at McDonald's?\n\nA. I don't know. Maybe three or four times.\n\nQ. Did you know you were going to speak at the meeting?\n\nA. Sort of. But we weren't sure. We were prepared to speak, but not guaranteed.\n\nQ. Did you practice the speech?\n\nA. Yes, three times -- at the hotel and at home. My mom was acting like she was the CEO.\n\nQ. Since you don't like McDonald's food, do you feel different from other kids?\n\nA. Sometimes I feel different. But everyone feels different once in a while.\n\nQ. Did your parents push you to do this speech?\n\nA. My parents never push me into anything.\n\nQ. What's your favorite meal?\n\nA. Spaghetti, tomato sauce, garlic bread and Caesar salad.\n\nQ. Where do you like to eat out?\n\nA. Pizza places.\n\nQ. What's your favorite dessert?\n\nA. Mangoes.\n\nQ. What's your favorite sweet?\n\nA. Gummy bears.\n\nQ. What do you think McDonald's should add to its menu?\n\nA. Healthy things like kale chips and veggies on a stick and fruit on a stick.\n\nQ. What's it like being famous at age 9?\n\nA. I was shocked that anything was written. I didn't think I would be famous.\n\nQ. Why do you think McDonald's targets kids?\n\nA.

Would you ever work for McDonald's?\n\nA.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in? Study looks at quality of life across the U.S.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

According to Statista, Pokémon Red, Green and Blue is the franchise’s most successful game, with more than 31 million units shipped worldwide.\n\nAs of July 2022, there were 905 unique Pokémon. There were also over 9,000 unique English-language Pokémon cards, according to Bulbapedia, creating substantial work for any collector trying to “catch 'em all.”\n\nAlthough you don’t need to purchase rare cards at auction in order to build a deck and battle other players, there are collectors willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on the rarest cards.\n\nHow many Pokémon are there?:We counted every generation of Pokémon, including Arceus.\n\nRemembering Kazuki Takahashi:'Yu-Gi-Oh!' creator found dead at sea at 60\n\nWhat is the most expensive Pokémon card?\n\nAs of August 2022, the most expensive Pokémon card is a Professional Sports Authenticator grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card that social media personality and boxer Logan Paul purchased for $5.275 million, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nA PSA grade of 10 means the card was in perfect condition. There is only one known PSA grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card in the world, according to Guinness.\n\nIn June 2021, Paul purchased a PSA grade 9 Pikachu Illustrator card for $1.275 million. He traded this card, along with $4 million, to obtain the PSA grade 10 card he now owns.\n\nAccording to Guinness, Paul wore his PSA 10 Pikachu Illustrator card on a chain around his neck to his April 2022 appearance at WrestleMania 38, where he was presented with a certificate for the world record.\n\nMost expensive Pokémon cards\n\nHere are some of the rarest and most expensive Pokémon cards, according to Dicebreaker:\n\n1. Pikachu Illustrator\n\nIn April 2022, it was confirmed that Logan Paul paid $5.275 million for a PSA grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card. The Illustrator card, given out to 39 winners of the 1997 and 1998 Pokémon illustration contests, is extremely rare. Only 23 have been certified by the PSA, and only one has been given a PSA rating of 10.\n\n2. 1999 First Edition Shadowless Holographic Charizard #4\n\nThis card sold for $420,000 at auction in March 2022, after breaking numerous records in the past. According to Dicebreaker, only 121 copies of the card have been rated as Gem Mint 10 by the PSA.\n\n3. Pokémon Blastoise #009/165R Commissioned Presentation Galaxy Star Hologram\n\nIn January 2021, this card was sold at auction for $350,000, making it the most valuable card at the time. This card is only two of a kind, created in 1998 by Wizards of the Coast, a company seeking a contract for the card game’s English-language release, for a sales pitch with Nintendo executives from Japan.\n\n4. Black Star Ishihara Signed GX Promo Card\n\nThis customized card featuring the Pokémon Company’s president, Tsunekazu Ishihara, was given to Pokémon employees to celebrate the executive’s 60th birthday in 2017. A copy of the card signed by Ishihara himself sold for $247,230 in April 2021.\n\n5. Kangaskhan-Holo #115 Family Event Trophy Card\n\nThis rare card sold for $150,100 in October 2020. Only three copies of the card have been sold in the last two decades, making it hard to come by. The card, given to participants in a Japanese parent/child tournament in 1998, is one of the rarest promotional cards in existence.\n\n6. 2000 Pokémon Neo Genesis 1st Edition Holo Lugia #9\n\nIn May 2021, this card sold for $144,300. Only three of these cards, which feature the legendary cover Pokémon from the Pokémon SoulSilver game, have a PSA rating of 10.\n\n7. 2006 Pokémon World Championships Promo No. 2 Trainer\n\nThis card sold for $110,100 in February 2021. The card was given as a trophy to Pokémon World Championship finalists in August 2006. Today, only three copies are said to exist.\n\n8. 1999 Super Secret Battle No. 1 Trainer\n\nThis rare card, given to finalists in an elite tournament held in a secret location in 1999, sold for $90,000 in July 2020.\n\n9. 1999 Pokémon Japanese Promo Tropical Mega Battle Tropical Wind\n\nThis card sold for $65,100 in October 2020. Only 12 copies were produced, given out as prizes at the 1999 Tropical Mega Battle tournament.\n\n10. 1996 Pokémon Japanese Base Set No Rarity Symbol Holo Venusaur\n\nThis card was sold at auction for $55,000 in November 2021. This Japanese language card is missing a stamp in its bottom-right corner, making it an extremely rare find.\n\n11. 2002 Pokémon World Championships No. 1 Trainer\n\nEach copy of this 2002 Pokémon World Championship prize card was printed with the name of its recipient, making each card one-of-a-kind. A copy sold for $31,200 in April 2021.\n\n12. Espeon and Umbreon Gold Star POP Series 5\n\nThese alternate-color “Eeveelution” cards, featured in an exclusive rewards program that required players to earn points at tournaments to exchange for Japanese-language versions of these cards, have both gone for over $20,000 at auction. In February 2021, an Espeon Gold Star card was bought for $22,000.\n\n13. Master’s Key\n\nThe Master’s Key card, given to competitors in the 2010 World Championships in Hawaii, was sold at auction for over $21,000 in November 2019.\n\n14. Prerelease Raichu\n\nRaichu was released in a 1999 card game expansion. Before its release date, copies of the card with a “Prerelease” stamp were accidentally printed. Although most copies were destroyed, some Wizards of the Coast staff reportedly received copies. Dicebreaker, reports the card was sold for $10,500 in April 2009 — though some speculate the card's existence is nothing but an April Fools' joke.\n\n15. 20th Anniversary 24-karat Gold Pikachu\n\nIn 2016, to celebrate the card game’s 20th anniversary, winners of a lottery were given the exclusive chance to buy this golden recreation of the original Pikachu card for $2,081.\n\nJust curious?:We're here to answer your everyday questions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/living-well/2014/05/10/vacation-iowa-list-eastern-iowa-events/8795651/", "title": "Vacation Iowa: Eastern Iowa events", "text": "The Des Moines Register\n\nMAY\n\n11-30 — Exhibit — I: Am Prints by Elizabeth Catlett, Maquoketa: Maquoketa Art Experience. 563-652-0295. www.maquoketa-art.org.\n\n11-31 — Photography: Antonio Scontrino, Waterloo: Waterloo Center for the Arts.

How have other stars done in MLS?", "text": "Major League Soccer has had its fair share of international soccer stars, but arguably no one greater than Lionel Messi. The 35-year-old Argentine star is planning to join Inter Miami following two seasons at Paris Saint-Germain. After speculation he would return to his boyhood club, FC Barcelona, Messi announced Wednesday he instead will head to the United States.\n\nThe move to Inter Miami comes six months after Messi achieved his greatest goal as a soccer player — winning a World Cup, Argentina’s first since 1986. Adding that achievement to his record-setting seven FIFA Ballon d'Or's solidified Messi as arguably the best soccer player of all-time. He achieved similar success with PSG, winning Ligue 1 for the second straight season. But his club floundered in Champions League competition, losing in the Round of 16 to Bayern Munich.\n\nMessi will start the next chapter of his career in the United States, joining a list of soccer icons who took their talents abroad later in their careers. That transition doesn’t always lead to immediate success. However, history says Messi is going to be just fine. Here's a breakdown of how eight former superstars fared in the league.\n\nDavid Beckham\n\nThe iconic English midfielder was the first notable name to join MLS when he made his move to the LA Galaxy in 2007. His decision to leave Spanish mega club Real Madrid in 2007 for a fledgling American league drew criticism but also helped grow MLS exponentially. It opened the door for stars to do the same in years to follow. The Galaxy reached records in merchandise sales and ESPN nationally broadcasted its first friendly against Chelsea FC.\n\nBeckham spent five years with the Galaxy, including two seasons on loan to Italian club AC Milan. In 98 MLS appearances, he scored 18 goals and had 31 assists. Injuries filled his first four seasons in Los Angeles before he had his best year in 2011, when Beckham and the Galaxy won their first of two consecutive MLS Cups. He returned to European play in 2013 to end his career with PSG. He is currently is a co-owner of Inter Miami.\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\nFrom one iconic English midfielder to another, Steven Gerrard joined LA Galaxy in 2015 after 17 seasons with Liverpool FC. The move was announced while Gerrard was in the middle of the English Premier League season. He made his debut at the conclusion of his Liverpool tenure.\n\nGerrard had a quiet stay in Los Angeles, playing in 34 games across two seasons. He scored two goals and had three assists his debut season, when he was named an MLS All-Star. Gerrard considered retirement after the 2015 season but stuck around for one more year. He had three goals and nine assists in 2016, retiring at the end of the year.\n\nThierry Henry\n\nWith his role diminishing with Barcelona, the French forward signed a multi-year deal with the New York Red Bulls in 2010. Henry had a short loan spell with Arsenal during the 2011-12 English Premier League season, which occurs while MLS is on break.\n\nHenry’s time in New York was his second-longest tenure with any club. He played in 122 matches with the Red Bulls, only playing more in nine seasons with Arsenal. Henry scored 51 goals, third-most in franchise history, and had 37 assists, the most in franchise history. His best statistical season came in 2012 when he had 15 goals and 12 assists and was a finalist for the MLS’ Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe Red Bulls never won the MLS cup with Henry, but did win the Supporters Shield in 2013, awarded to the club with the best record. Henry retired with the Red Bulls in 2014.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimović\n\nMessi isn’t the first player to go from PSG to an MLS club. Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimović made the move in 2018 when he joined the LA Galaxy. He announced his decision with a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times, telling readers: “Dear Los Angeles, you’re welcome.”\n\nIbrahimović took the league by storm, coming off the bench for his debut and scoring two goals to lead the Galaxy to a comeback win over their rival, LAFC. He had 52 goals in 56 appearances during two seasons, often calling himself “by far” the best player in MLS. He was named an All-Star both seasons and reached 500 career goals while with the Galaxy.\n\nHis 30 goals during the 2019 season were the second-most he’s ever scored in a season. The Galaxy never won an MLS Cup with Ibrahimović, but his play continued to grow interest in the league. He returned to Italian club AC Milan in 2019, playing four seasons before retiring Sunday.\n\nKaká\n\nThe Brazilian midfield star joined MLS expansion team Orlando City in 2015, citing his interest to always play in the United States. Kaká signed a $6.6 million deal that, at the time, made him the highest paid MLS player ever. His decision to play for Orlando came after a long career in Europe and a short stint at his boyhood club in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nKaká appeared in 75 games during his three seasons in Orlando, scoring 24 goals and adding 21 assists. He was named an MLS All-Star each season. His 11 assists during the 2016 season were his highest since the 2004-05 season with AC Milan. Orlando City never made it to the playoffs with Kaká, who called it a career after the 2017 season.\n\nFrank Lampard\n\nOut of all the international stars to join MLS, Frank Lampard's start may have been the bumpiest. Reports surfaced in July 2014 that Lampard signed a two-year deal with New York City FC. The parent club of New York City, Manchester City, announced a month later Lampard would be loaned to Manchester City for six months. Days before the end of his loan, it was announced Lampard's contract was extended to the end of the English Premier League season.\n\nFans expressed anger about the decision and MLS accused New York City FC of dishonesty. Lampard finally made his MLS debut in August 2015, playing 10 games that season. New York City fans jeered him in his 2016 season debut, a game Lampard’s side lost 7-0. But they turned around quickly, as Lampard scored 12 times in 19 games, including the club’s first ever hat trick. Lampard retired in February 2017, two months after New York City’s season concluded.\n\nWayne Rooney\n\nThe Manchester United legend left England for D.C. United in 2018. Rooney signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club, marking the first time he’d ever played in a league outside of England.\n\nHe only fulfilled two years of his deal, making 48 appearances with 23 goals and 15 assists. His 12 goals during his debut season earned him D.C. United’s MVP award and the club’s Golden Boot. D.C. United never advanced past the first round during Rooney’s tenure. He left MLS in 2019, retiring with his boyhood club Derby County in 2021.\n\nDavid Villa\n\nAfter 11 seasons in Spain’s top league, playing for Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, Villa decided to join newly-formed New York City FC in 2014. Villa expressed his desire to grow MLS as a reason for his move, calling it an “irresistible project.”\n\nHe dominated his four seasons with New York, scoring 77 goals and adding 20 assists.

He will join Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer, he announced Wednesday, a stunning development that brings the 2022 World Cup champion and record-setting seven-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner to one of the league's newest teams.\n\nA deal is not yet done, Messi said during a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and Sport, but he is committed to completing the transaction.\n\n\"I made the decision that I'm going to go to Miami,\" he said during the interview. \"I still haven't closed it 100% percent. I'm missing some things, but we decided to continue on the path. If the Barcelona thing didn't work out, I wanted to leave Europe, get out of the spotlight and think more of my family.\"\n\nCBS Sports and BBC journalist Guillem Balague, who wrote Messi's authorized biography, first reported earlier Wednesday that Messi had decided.\n\nWhy did Messi choose Miami over Saudi Arabia and Barcelona?\n\nWhile a move by Messi to Miami had been rumor fodder, such a transaction seemed like a dreamland scenario for MLS and a team that is in its fourth season, sits in last place in the Eastern Conference and recently sacked its coach. An offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly would have paid Messi around $400 million a year, according to The Telegraph.\n\nFC Barcelona – where Messi played 17 seasons, winning 10 La Liga titles – also was considered in the mix, with Messi's father suggesting his son would prefer a return to his old club.\n\nMessi said Wednesday there were a lot of things missing from his talks with Barcelona, and there wasn't a formal, written proposal. He didn't feel comfortable waiting on the unknown. He also said economics were not a problem for him and that if his decision was solely about money, he would have gone to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I had offers from other European teams, but I didn't even evaluate them because my idea was to go to Barcelona,\" he said. \"And if the Barcelona thing didn't come out, analyzing it, then leaving European football.\"\n\nHe added he's hopeful to focus more on family and his well-being in the United States.\n\n\"Obviously, I really wanted to (return to Barcelona),\" Messi said. \"I had a lot of desire to be able to return. But, on the other hand, having lived what I lived, and the exit that I had, I did not want to return to be in the same situation again.\"\n\nMLS and Inter Miami, which is owned by David Beckham, had to get imaginative in the attempt to lure Messi. MLS and its broadcast partner, Apple, offered Messi a share of revenue generated by new subscribers to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+, the Athletic reported citing multiple sources. Messi also was offered a profit-sharing deal with Adidas, per the Athletic. On Tuesday, Apple TV+ announced that it was developing a four-part documentary series featuring Messi.\n\n\"We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer this summer,\" MLS said in a statement. \"Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our League.\"\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW: Stay up to date with our sports newsletter\n\nMilestone moment for MLS\n\nLanding Messi will be considered a seminal moment in the history of a league that continues to strive for consistent relevance in a crowded American sports landscape. One such moment happened 16 years ago when global soccer icon David Beckham joined the Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham's arrival spawned the league's designated player rule ― also known as \"The Beckham Rule\" ― in which MLS teams can acquire players outside of the salary cap. Also part of the deal to get Beckham to join the Galaxy was an option for him to buy an MLS expansion team for $25 million. In February 2014 Beckham exercised that option to bring a team to Miami, and on March 1, 2020 Inter Miami CF finally made its debut.\n\nThe Major League Soccer that Messi will join is very different from the league Beckham joined in 2007. That season, there were just 13 teams; MLS recently announced its 30th club. MLS' regular-season attendance averaged 15,504 in 2006, the season before Beckham's arrival. During the 2023 season, five MLS teams ― each of which did not exist before Beckham's arrival ― average more than 25,000 fans a game. So far this season, the league averages more than 21,000 a game.\n\nHOW DID THEY DO? 8 major soccer stars who moved from Europe to MLS before Lionel Messi\n\nTHE MESSI EFFECT: Inter Miami CF ticket prices, popularity soar after MLS announcement\n\nRough end for Messi at PSG\n\nMessi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain expired with the end of the 2022-23 Ligue 1 season, during which PSG were league champions but had a disappointing UEFA Champions League campaign, bowing out during the Round of 16.

And you know me, sooner or later, I will be back.”\n\nBarcelona president Joan Laporta paid tribute to Piqué, calling him part of the fabric of the club.\n\n“Piqué is part of the Barca badge, he has achieved everything with the club,” Laporta said.\n\n“He will always be an icon for the culers, he has more than demonstrated what he wants from Barca. 25 years he has been linked to the club. It has been an honor to have him as a Barca player.”\n\nPiqué’s contract ran until 2024, but according to La Vanguardia newspaper the 35-year-old will forego the remaining year-and-a-half of his salary, a gesture that will help Barca given the club’s well documented financial problems.\n\nPiqué carries the UEFA European Championship trophy down the steps after the game, as he is mobbed by fans.

For me Pele remains the greatest of all time and I was proud to be on the the pitch with him. RIP Pele and thank you.”\n\nBrazil’s incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took to Twitter to pay his respects to Pelé, saying “few Brazilians took the name of our country as far as he did.”\n\n“As different from Portuguese as the language was, foreigners from the four corners of the planet soon found a way to pronounce the magic word: ‘Pelé,’” Lula added.\n\nA public wake will be held for Pelé on Monday at the Urbano Caldeira stadium, popularly known as Vila Belmiro and home to Santos football club, in Brazil’s São Paulo state, according to a Thursday statement from Santos FC.\n\nAt dawn Monday, Pele’s body will be moved from the Albert Einstein Hospital to the stadium. The soccer legend’s coffin will be placed in the center of the pitch.\n\nThe wake at Vila Belmiro will continue until Tuesday 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. ET), after which a funeral procession will carry Pelé’s coffin through the streets of the city of Santos, including the street where Pelé’s 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, lives.\n\nThe cortege will continue to Pelé’s final resting place, the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica cemetery in Santos, where a private funeral, reserved for family members, will be held.\n\nDazzling ability\n\nPelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in Três Corações – an inland city roughly 155 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro – in 1940, before his family moved to the city of Bauru in São Paulo.\n\nThe genesis of the nickname Pelé are unclear, even to the footballer. He once wrote in the British newspaper The Guardian that it likely started with school classmates teasing him for mangling the nickname of another player, Bilé. Whatever the origin, the moniker stuck.\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches. Domicio Pinheiro/Agência Estado/AP\n\nAs a child, his first taste of soccer involved playing barefoot with socks and rags rolled up into a ball – a humble beginning that would grow into a long and fruitful career.\n\nBut when he first took up the game, his ambitions were modest.\n\n“My dad was a good football player, he scored a lot of goals,” Pelé told CNN in 2015. “His name was Dondinho; I wanted to be like him.\n\n“He was famous in Brazil, in Minas Gerais. He was my role model. I always wanted to be like him, but what happened, to this day, only God can explain.”\n\nAs a teenager, Pelé left home and began training with Santos, scoring his first goal for the club side before his 16th birthday. He would go on to score 619 times over 638 appearances for the club, but it is his feats in the iconic yellow jersey of Brazil for which he is best remembered.\n\nThe world first got a glimpse of Pelé’s dazzling ability in 1958, when he made his World Cup debut aged 17. He scored Brazil’s only goal in the country’s quarterfinal victory against Wales, then netted a hat-trick in the semifinal against France and two in the final against host Sweden.\n\nBrazil players hold a banner showing support for former Brazil player Pele after the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Round of 16 match between Brazil and South Korea on December 5. Michael Steele/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n“When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding,” said Sweden’s Sigvard Parling.\n\nFor Pelé, the standout memory from the tournament was putting his country on the sporting map.\n\n“When we won the World Cup, everybody knew about Brazil,” he told CNN’s Don Riddell in 2016. “I think this was the most important thing I gave to my country because we were well known after that World Cup.”\n\nAnother World Cup victory came in 1962, although an injury sidelined Pelé for the tournament’s later stages. Further injuries hampered his next campaign in 1966 as Brazil exited the competition after the group stage, but redemption came in 1970.\n\n“Pelé was saying that we were going to win, and if Pelé was saying that, then we were going to win the World Cup,” Brazil’s co-captain Carlos Alberto said about the tournament.\n\nThat team – featuring the likes of Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Rivellino, and, of course, Pelé – is regarded as one of the greatest ever assembled.\n\nIn the final – a 4-1 victory against Italy – Brazil scored arguably the most famous World Cup goal of all time, a sweeping, length-of-the-pitch move involving nine of the team’s 10 outfield players.\n\nIt ended with Pelé teeing up Alberto, who drilled the ball into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil’s mantra of jogo bonito (the beautiful game) has never been better encapsulated.\n\nPelé, who had considered retiring before the 1970 World Cup, scored a goal of his own in the final and a total of four over the course of the tournament.\n\n“Before the match, I told myself that Pelé was just flesh and bones like the rest of us,” Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich said after his side’s defeat in the final. “Later, I realized I’d been wrong.”\n\nThe tournament capped Pelé’s World Cup career but not his time in the spotlight. In 1975, he signed a $1.67-million-a-year contract in the United States with the New York Cosmos.\n\nOne of the greatest players\n\nWith his larger-than-life personality and extraordinary dribbling skills – a trademark of his game – Pele’s helped the Cosmos win the North American Soccer League championship in 1977 before officially retiring from football.\n\nThe league, which attracted further big names like Giorgio Chinaglia and Franz Beckenbauer, wouldn’t last, ultimately folding in 1984. But around the world, Pelé’s influence endured.\n\nHe remained in the public eye through endorsement deals and as an outspoken political voice who championed the poor in Brazil. He served as a Goodwill UNICEF ambassador for many years, promoting peace and support for vulnerable children.\n\nHealth problems persisted for much of Pelé’s later life.

He was hospitalized in Sao Paulo in November as the 2022 World Cup was being played in Qatar, prompting an outpouring of support from the global soccer community and beyond.\n\nDebate will inevitably rage about whether Pelé is the greatest player of all time – whether it is possible to compare Pelé’s achievements to those of Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, who have rewritten soccer’s record books over the past 15 years, or to Diego Maradona, the late Argentinian star who captivated the footballing world in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nIn 2000, FIFA jointly named Maradona and Pelé as Player of the Century, but to some, the outright winner of the award should have been obvious.\n\n“This debate about the player of the century is absurd,” said Zico, who represented Brazil in the decade after Pelé’s retirement. “There’s only one possible answer: Pelé. He’s the greatest player of all time, and by some distance, I might add.”\n\nBefore Christmas, Pele's daughter posted a moving photo with father in hospital. Kely Nascimento/Instagram\n\nExactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored in unofficial matches.\n\nIn March 2021, he congratulated Portugal’s Ronaldo for passing his “record of goals in official matches” – 767.\n\nThere is little doubt, however, that Pelé was, and always will be, football’s first global superstar.\n\n“If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried to do my best,” he told The Talks online magazine. “My sport allowed me to do so much because it’s the biggest sport in the world.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha George Ramsay Tara John Flora Charner Rodrigo Pedroso", "Camilo Rocha", "George Ramsay", "Tara John", "Flora Charner", "Rodrigo Pedroso"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mls/2021/06/02/lionel-messi-mls-rumors-usmnt-nations-league-euro-2020-players/7516020002/", "title": "Lionel Messi to MLS rumors.

But when an iconic player of Lionel Messi's stature is being linked to a possible move to MLS, exceptions can and will be made. It’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time this year that Messi’s been linked with a move to MLS, but it is the latest episode of it.\n\nAnd, of course, David Beckham’s Inter Miami CF project is in the fray. Sport.ES, based in Spain’s Catalan region, reported that Messi’s current negotiation to re-sign for FC Barcelona as part of a 10-year deal that includes both on- and off-field roles also features a multi-year stay at Inter Miami.\n\nDoes this report have more teeth than reports this past winter of a contract with City Football Group that suggested Messi would jump to Manchester City and later to New York City FC? Who knows? But one thing we know for sure is that it’s worth keeping occasional tabs on Messi’s possible movements and that’s even more true if MLS is being mentioned alongside his name.\n\nRATINGS:UEFA Champions League final averages 3.65 million viewers in U.S.\n\nMLS news and notes\n\nLeague goes on break: With the Concacaf Nations League and World Cup qualifying taking place, MLS goes on an extended break between games, returning to full action the weekend of June 18-20. The U.S., Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico will compete in Denver in the first-ever Concacaf Nations League finals, thus completing a competition that started in 2018. For the USMNT, it represents the first meaningful games since it clinched its spot in the Nations League final with a 4-0 win over Cuba on Nov. 19, 2019. Elsewhere, the remaining Concacaf squads carry on with first-round qualification games for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The USMNT, Costa Rica, Honduras, Jamaica and Mexico already have qualified for the eight-team final round that will begin play in September.\n\nConcacaf Nations League finals schedule\n\nThursday (semifinals) Honduras vs. USMNT, 7:30 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN)\n\nMexico vs. Costa Rica, 10 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN) Sunday Semifinal winners, 9 p.m. ET (Paramount+, TUDN)\n\nMLS shows well in USMNT-Switzerland friendly: The U.S. men’s national team opened the ongoing FIFA window for international play with a 2-1 loss to world-ranked No. 13 Switzerland on Sunday. Putting the loss aside, there were plenty of positives to take from the game, including periods of impressive play from the Americans. It was an especially positive match for Major League Soccer fans as three players from the league featured in the game. Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Sebastian Lletget opened the scoring in the fifth minute to put the USMNT in front. Lletget, whose goal was the seventh of his international career, started alongside San Jose Earthquakes midfielder Jackson Yueill. Both players went for 61 minutes in the game. When they were subbed off by manager Gregg Berhalter, Colorado Rapids midfielder Kellyn Acosta entered the game. The only MLS-based player who didn’t see time in the match was Real Salt Lake goalkeeper David Ochoa.\n\nDike rejoins USMNT camp: Daryl Dike, who lit up England’s second-division Championship while on loan with Barnsley (nine goals in 19 appearances), returned to the U.S. men’s national team picture this week, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. After Barnsley declined the purchase option on Dike’s loan agreement, Dike participated in the U.S. men’s national team camp centered around the Concacaf Nations League finals, which resumed Thursday for the Americans against Honduras (7:30 p.m.). Dike is set to return to Orlando City SC, but will train in Berhalter’s camp ahead of next week’s friendly against Costa Rica, which he would be eligible to play in. Dike isn’t rostered for the purposes of Nations League play.\n\nJozy Altidore's TFC future in doubt: On-again, off-again USMNT forward Jozy Altidore was not with his Toronto FC teammates during last week's loss to the Columbus Crew after being told to train on his own following a disagreement with coach Chris Armas, according to multiple reports. \"We still are going to use the international break to discuss the situation, in-house,\" Toronto FC GM Ali Curtis told The Canadian Press. \"That conversation will be handled internally. It will be a club decision. And it will incorporate what I would say is the totality of the time that Jozy has been with the club.\" Altidore is one of three designated players for Toronto FC, along with midfielders Yeferson Soteldo and Alejandro Pozuelo, the reigning MLS MVP.\n\nInter Miami penalized: Last week, MLS announced sanctions against Inter Miami CF for salary budget and roster violations. Sure, the league has complicated and convoluted roster rules, but Inter Miami really botched this. The team had five players on its roster in 2020 that should have occupied designated player spots (the league limit is three). It also underreported the salaries for three other players. While the league fined the club $2 million and issued a $250,000 fine to managing owner Jorge Mas, it's the reduction of $2,271,250 in allocation money for the 2022 and 2023 seasons that will hinder Inter Miami's roster-building capabilities moving forward.\n\nAnother Aaronson: On the same day that the 20-year-old Brenden Aaronson started for the USMNT in the friendly against Switzerland, his 17-year-old brother Paxten made his Philadelphia Union debut in a 3-0 win over the Portland Timbers. Expectations are high for Paxten, whose brother made the move from the Union to Red Bull Salzburg – the Austrian Bundesliga champions – after the 2020 MLS season. Also, Paxten is coming up in one of the league's top developers of young talent, and his older brother wasn't the only Union product to make the move to Europe over the winter. Defender Mark McKenzie – who also started for the USMNT on Sunday – transferred from the Union to Genk in Belgium.\n\nVancouver adds firepower: The Vancouver Whitecaps (2-4-1) are currently the 10th team out of 13 in the Western Conference and have been just a few goals short of putting themselves in far better position in the standings. The ‘Caps attempted to address their offensive needs by trading for the New York Red Bulls’ 25-year-old Brian White. Vancouver sent an initial $400,000 in General Allocation Money to the Red Bulls and performance incentives could see the number rise to as much as an additional $100,000 GAM. White had 15 goals and four assists in 47 appearances in his time with New York.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n68: Squads for the postponed Euro 2020 were finalized this week, and seven Major League Soccer players made rosters for their respective nations: Chicago Fire FC midfielder Przemyslaw Frankowski (Poland); Minnesota United midfielder Ján Greguš (Slovakia); Philadelphia Union midfielder Dániel Gazdag and FC Dallas forward Szabolcs Schön (Hungary); and Minnesota United defender Jukka Raitala and midfielder Robin Lod, and CF Montreal forward Lassi Lappalainen (Finland). Those three players named to Finland's Euro squad represents the most MLS has ever had called into a single team for the European Championships. In all, 68 MLS players – representing 26 of the league's 27 teams – have been called into national team competitions, with the Columbus Crew and Toronto FC having the most players called up by their national teams (five apiece). Canada, meanwhile, is the country that has called up the most MLS players (10).\n\nEURO 2020:Complete squads for the European Championship\n\nMLS power rankings: Top 10 power poll\n\n1. Seattle Sounders: Seattle's best start in franchise history cooled off in its final two games before the three-week break, with draws at home against Atlanta United and expansion side Austin FC.\n\n2. New England Revolution: Coach Bruce Arena's Eastern Conference front-runners have won their previous three games, in large part due to the contributions of playmaking midfielder Carles Gil, an early season favorite for league MVP honors.\n\n3. Philadelphia Union: With Concacaf Champions League obligations out of the way for the time being (Philadelphia's semifinal showdown with Club America isn't until Aug. 12), the Union have been on an absolute tear that has reminded fans of why this team was Supporters' Shield winners in 2020.\n\n4. Los Angeles Galaxy: While Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez is pacing the league with seven goals scored, Jonathan Bond has been stellar in goal. Bond recorded 12 saves in last week's win over the San Jose Earthquakes, earning MLS Player of the Week honors.\n\n5. Orlando City SC: Orlando's unbeaten start to the season came to an end last week in a road loss to the New York Red Bulls. Could Daryl Dike be back with the team after the break? The striker had his option to purchase declined by Championship side Barnsley, with whom Dike had thrived.\n\n6. Sporting Kansas City: SKC sits in second place in the Western Conference and just two points behind Seattle, despite the Sounders' hot start. Fueling Kansas City's surge are Alan Pulido (third in MLS in goals scored) and Gianluca Busio, who scored a bend-it-like-Beckham-esque free kick in Saturday's win, just a day after his 19th birthday.\n\n7. New York City FC: NYCFC rallied for a late road win over Los Angeles FC after being reduced to 10 players in what coach Ronny Deila called \"by far the biggest win\" of his two-year tenure with the team.\n\n8. Colorado Rapids: Colorado collected 12 points from five games in May to enter June in the Western Conference mix. Coach Robin Fraser's team comes off the break facing FC Cincinnati and Sporting Kansas City on the road, the latter matchup being a test of this team's chances in the West.\n\n9. Nashville SC: Nashville remained one of two undefeated teams (along with the Seattle Sounders) with a dramatic road draw against Atlanta United last week. Down 2-0, Hany Mukhtar scored two goals in three minutes to stun the crowd of 41,000 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and keep Nashville's surprising unbeaten streak alive.\n\n10.

He was 49.\n\nHe “collapsed” while covering Friday’s Argentina-Netherlands match, a witness told CNN.\n\nQatar’s World Cup organizers said on Saturday that Wahl “fell ill” in the press area, where he received “immediate medical treatment on site.” He was then transferred to Hamad General Hospital, said a spokesperson for the Supreme Court Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body responsible for planning the tournament.\n\nGrant Wahl, pictured on October 10, 2014. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire/Corbis/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nHe was treated in the stadium “for about 20-25 minutes” before he was moved to the hospital, Keir Radnedge, a columnist at World Soccer Magazine, told CNN Saturday.\n\n“This was towards the end of extra time in the match. Suddenly, colleagues up to my left started shouting for medical assistance. Obviously, someone had collapsed. Because the chairs are freestanding, people were able to move the chairs, so it’s possible to create a little bit of space around him,” Radnedge said.\n\nHe added that the medical team were there “pretty quickly and were able to, as best they could, give treatment.”\n\nThe circumstances around his death are not clear.\n\n“The entire US Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl,” US Soccer said in a statement on its official Twitter account.\n\n“Grant made soccer his life’s work, and we are devastated that he and his brilliant writing will no longer be with us.”\n\nUS Soccer praised Wahl’s passion and “belief in the power of the game to advance human rights,” and shared its condolences with Wahl’s wife, Celine Gounder, and his loved ones.\n\nGounder also posted the US Soccer statement on Twitter.\n\n“I am so thankful for the support of my husband Grant Wahl’s soccer family and of so many friends who’ve reached out tonight. I’m in complete shock,” wrote Gounder, a former CNN contributor who served on the Biden-Harris transition Covid-19 advisory board.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the department was in “close communication” with Wahl’s family. The World Cup organizers also said they were in touch with the US embassy “to ensure the process of repatriating the body is in accordance with the family’s wishes.”\n\nWahl wearing a rainbow-colored t-shirt while working at Qatar 2022. Doug Zimmerman/ISI Photos/Getty Images\n\nWahl had covered soccer for more than two decades, including 11 World Cups — six men’s, five women’s – and authored several books on the sport, according to his website.\n\nHe had just celebrated his birthday earlier this week with “a great group of media friends at the World Cup,” according to a post on his official Twitter account, which added: “Very thankful for everyone.”\n\nFeeling ill\n\nIn an episode of the podcast Futbol with Grant Wahl, published days before his death on December 6, he had complained of feeling unwell.\n\n“It had gotten pretty bad in terms of like the tightness in my chest, tightness, pressure. Feeling pretty hairy, bad,” Wahl told co-host Chris Wittyngham in the episode. He added that he sought help at the medical clinic at the World Cup media center, believing he had bronchitis.\n\nHe was given cough syrup and ibuprofen, and felt better shortly afterward, he said.\n\nWahl also said he experienced an “involuntary capitulation by my body and mind” after the US-Netherlands game on December 3.\n\n“This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve done eight of these on the men’s side,” he said at the time. “And so like, I’ve gotten sick to some extent at every tournament, and it’s just about trying to find a way to like get your work done.”\n\nHe further described the incident in a recent newsletter published on December 5, writing that his body had “broke down” after he had little sleep, high stress and a heavy workload. He’d had a cold for 10 days, which “turned into something more severe,” he wrote, adding that he felt better after receiving antibiotics and catching up on sleep.\n\nWahl had made headlines in November by reporting that he was detained and briefly refused entry to a World Cup match because he was wearing a rainbow t-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights.\n\nHe said security staff had told him to change his shirt because “it’s not allowed,” and had taken his phone. Wahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium.\n\nAfterward, Wahl told CNN he “probably will” wear the shirt again.\n\nTributes pour in\n\nWahl’s death has sent shockwaves through the soccer and sports journalism community, with many sharing tributes on social media.\n\n“Only some days ago, Grant was recognized by FIFA and AIPS (the International Sports Press Association) for his contribution to reporting on eight consecutive FIFA World Cups,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino in a statement.\n\nInfantino and FIFA media director Bryan Swanson were at the hospital on Saturday to offer any kind of support needed for the family, friends, and the journalists who were also his housemates in Qatar.\n\nThe co-editors in chief of Sports Illustrated, the publication where Wahl spent the majority of his career, said in a joint statement they were “shocked and devastated at the news of Grant’s passing.”\n\nWahl at an awards ceremony in Doha, Qatar, in November this year. FIFA/AP\n\n“We were proud to call him a colleague and friend for two decades – no writer in the history of (Sports Illustrated) has been more passionate about the sport he loved and the stories he wanted to tell,” said the statement.\n\nIt added that Wahl had first joined the publication in November 1996. He had volunteered to cover the sport as a junior reporter – back before it reached the heights of global popularity it now enjoys – eventually becoming “one of the most respected soccer authorities in the world,” it said.\n\nThe statement said that Wahl also worked with other media outlets including Fox Sports. After leaving Sports Illustrated in 2020, he began publishing his podcast and newsletter.\n\nOn Friday in Philadelphia, basketball star LeBron James said he had been “very fond of Grant.” While Wahl was at Sports Illustrated, he did a cover story on James when James was in high school.\n\n“I’ve always kind of watched from a distance even when I moved up in ranks and became a professional, and he went to a different sport,” said James, speaking at a postgame press conference. “Any time his name would come up I’ll always think back to me as a teenager and having Grant in our building … It’s a tragic loss.”\n\nTennis great Billie Jean King said the American’s death was “heartbreaking.”\n\n“A talented journalist, Grant was an advocate for the LGBTQ community & a prominent voice for women’s soccer,” King tweeted Saturday. “He used his platform to elevate those whose stories needed telling. Prayers for his family.”\n\nOther current and former US soccer players, including Ali Krieger and Tony Meola, shared their condolences, as did sporting bodies such as Major League Soccer and the National Women’s Soccer League.\n\nWittyngham, Wahl’s podcast co-host, told CNN on Saturday the news of his death had been hard to fathom.\n\n“For Americans, Grant Wahl is the first person you read covering soccer. He was kind of the only person for a while … Grant was the first person who really paid genuine attention to this sport in a meaningful way,” Wittyngham said.\n\nSeveral journalists shared stories of reporting alongside Wahl, and having encountered him at multiple World Cups over the years.\n\n“Before he became the best covering soccer he did hoops and was so kind to me,” wrote famed broadcaster Dick Vitale.\n\nTimmy T. Davis, the US Ambassador to Qatar, tweeted that Wahl was “a well known and greatly respected reporter who focused on the beautiful game.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Teele Rebane Chris Eldergill", "Jessie Yeung", "Teele Rebane", "Chris Eldergill"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2023/06/06/pga-tour-liv-golf-merge-saudi-backed/70292809007/", "title": "LIV-PGA merger live updates: Monahan has heated meeting with ...", "text": "In a surprise announcement Tuesday morning that came after a year of bitter fracturing in men's professional golf, the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour announced an agreement to merge their business operations.\n\nThe ramifications of the development are still unraveling, as a 4 p.m. ET meeting was scheduled for PGA Tour players, many of whom reported being entirely unaware of the agreement.\n\nBoth the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, along with the DP World Tour, announced the move in a joint statement published Tuesday. The merger aims to create \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity to ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game’s best players.\"\n\nThe terms of the agreement are not fully finalized and are scheduled to be completed in the coming months.\n\n\"After two years of disruption and distraction, this is a historic day for the game we all know and love,\" PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"Going forward, fans can be confident that we will, collectively, deliver on the promise we’ve always made — to promote competition of the best in professional golf and that we are committed to securing and driving the game’s future.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the merger agreement.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: 'I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players'\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who is among the most notable names who bolted from the PGA Tour to join LIV Golf last year, appeared on \"CNN Primetime\" for an interview with anchor Kaitlan Collins to discuss Tuesday's stunning news of a merger between the Tour and LIV.\n\n\"There’s a lot more behind closed doors that’s been going on. What I can tell you is that H-E, Yasir, has always been a staunch supporter of golf globally and wanting to grow the game,\" DeChambeau said, referring to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who is the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. \"That’s been his vision from the start, when we first started talking a few years ago. As it’s come to fruition now I think this is the best thing that could ever happen for the game of golf. And I'm extremely proud to be part of that because of the fact that the fans are going to get what they want, the players are going to experience something a little different, a little new on the PGA Tour side, but I truly believe, in the end, the game of golf wins in this scenario.\"\n\nCollins then asked DeChambeau if he thought that Jay Monahan was a hypocrite after the PGA Tour commissioner had been critical of the Saudi-back golf league and the players who bolted the Tour for LIV.\n\n\"I do feel bad for the PGA Tour players because they were told one thing and something else happened, and our side, we were told one thing and it’s come to fruition. In the end, for me, I want the players, the fans and the game of golf to win,\" DeChambeau said. \"It does stink a little bit from my perspective that the PGA Tour players are not necessarily winning. I hope they can find a way to make sure they are valued in the same way that we are over at LIV. I think that’ll happen, it’s just going to take some time with players pushing back a little bit and trying to figure out what gives them the best opportunity to be successful on their own end. Eventually, we all come back together now and play as one group, and I think that's the best thing.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner: 'People are going to call me a hypocrite'\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Tuesday he's well aware \"people are going to call me a hypocrite\" after he made a stunning reversal and merged with LIV Golf having previously denounced the Saudi-backed league over its ties to the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, Monahan described Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as \"a great and world-class investor.\"\n\n“I recognize that people are going to call me a hypocrite. Anytime I said anything, I said it with the information that I had at that moment, and I said it based on someone that’s trying to compete for the PGA Tour and our players. I accept those criticisms,\" Monahan said in a conference call on Tuesday, according to Golf Week. \"But circumstances do change. I think that in looking at the big picture and looking at it this way, that’s what got us to this point.”\n\nMonahan said the deal has been in the works for seven weeks: \"We just realized that we were better off together than we were fighting or apart, and by thinking about the game at large and eliminating a lot of the friction that’s been out there and doing this in a way where we can move forward.\"\n\nPGA Tour commissioner held 'intense' player meeting after merger\n\nJay Monahan held a players-only meeting at the Canadian Open Tuesday afternoon following the surprise announcement merger of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf that blindsided many players. Many top players were not present at the meeting, which Monahan described as \"intense, certainly heated,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m not surprised,” Monahan said. “This is an awful lot to ask them to digest. This is a significant change for us. As I’m trying to explain as we go forward, this ultimately was a decision in the best interests of all at the PGA Tour.”\n\nMonahan said that although he expects \"a lot of questions and criticism\" right now, \"players who stayed with the PGA Tour will see they benefited in many ways\" in the long run.\n\nMichael Kim attended the meeting and said he was \"disappointed as all of you.\" He tweeted, \"Well… the meeting happened… Came in very excited… but not a whole lot happened, too many details still up in the air.\"\n\nGolf Channel's Brandel Chamblee 'disappointed' in PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger\n\nFormer men's pro golfer and current Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee has been one of the most outspoken critics of LIV Golf and its disruption to the sport. After news of the merger broke, Chamblee spoke about the matter and expressed his displeasure with the PGA Tour.\n\n\"After the shock sort of ebbed away, I was hugely disappointed,\" Chamblee said Tuesday during an appearance on the Golf Channel. \"I think this is one of the saddest days in the history of professional golf. I do believe the governing bodies, the entities, have sacrificed their principles for profit.\"\n\nChamblee said he suspected there were three key reasons behind the decision to merge: legal issues over previously-pending antitrust litigation; \"entanglements\" some PGA Tour sponsors have with PIF capital; and the sheer amount of Saudi money that became available to the PGA Tour with the merger.\n\nWhat do we know about the terms of the merger agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf?\n\nThere are still several key details that are unknown about the merger. For starters, the new entity does not have a name yet.\n\nA key element in the merger is financial. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, \"will make a capital investment into the new entity to facilitate its growth and success,\" according to the news release. The PIF had been the sole entity to entirely fund the LIV Golf operation.\n\nAdditionally, the merger stipulates that the PIF \"will initially be the exclusive investor in the new entity\" and \"will have the exclusive right to further invest in the new entity, including a right of first refusal on any capital.\"\n\nA newly established board of directors will direct and oversee the new entity's operations, schedule, investments. PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will be part of the new entity's board of directors and will be on its executive committee. The announcement of the full board will come at a later date.\n\nAdditionally, the merger will lead to \"a mutually agreed end to all pending litigation between the participating parties.\" In August 2022, a number of golfers who joined the LIV tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions.\n\nThe merger stipulates that after the conclusion of the 2023 season, the PGA Tour, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour \"will work cooperatively and in good faith to establish a fair and objective process\" to allow players who left the PGA Tour and DP tour to re-apply for membership.\n\nLIV Golf only part of Saudi 'sportswashing'\n\nIt's not just golf that is being upended by Saudi money.\n\nIn addition to financing Tuesday's merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced this week that it has effectively seized controlling stakes in four of the largest teams in the country's pro soccer league, in an effort to lure top European talent there.\n\nFreelance reporter Fabrizio Romano reported for The Guardian on Tuesday that the one of those teams, Al-Ittihad, is signing Real Madrid star Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante of Chelsea, each for exorbitant sums. Benzema is due to make roughly $213 million per year over two seasons, according to Romano, while Kante's contract is reported to be in excess of $106 million per year.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is making more than $200 million per year with another Saudi team, Al-Nassr, and Romano reports that Lionel Messi has been offered more than $370 million to play for Al-Hilal. The PIF also owns Newcastle United, a prominent English team.\n\nActivists and academics have pointed to the PIF's investment in soccer and golf as part of a broader campaign of Saudi \"sportswashing,\" or using sports to polish a country's otherwise problematic reputation. Saudi Arabia has a track record of human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. — Tom Schad\n\nU.S. Senators call out PGA Tour for 'hypocrisy' over merger with LIV Golf\n\nTwo United States senators took to social media on Tuesday to address the monster news that the PGA Tour was merging with LIV Golf.\n\nOregon’s Ron Wyden, who serves as the chairman of the Committee on Finance, blasted the deal, vowing to explore its economic impact. The merger means that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will be backing professional golf stateside and abroad.\n\n\"Hypocrisy doesn’t begin to describe this brazen, shameless cash grab,\" he said on Twitter. \"I’m going to dive into every piece of Saudi Arabia’s deal with the PGA. U.S. officials need to consider whether a deal will give the Saudi regime inappropriate control or access to U.S. real estate.\"\n\nConnecticut’s Chris Murphy expressed surprise at the deal. He said representatives from the PGA recently visited his office and were upset at the track record of social justice violations by the Middle Eastern country.\n\n\"So weird. PGA officials were in my office just months ago talking about how the Saudis' human rights record should disqualify them from having a stake in a major American sport,\" he said while retweeting a news post of the unification.\n\n\"I guess maybe their concerns weren't really about human rights?\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhat was Phil Mickelson's LIV Golf deal worth?\n\nAlthough Phil Mickelson has not revealed the exact amount of his signing bonus to join the LIV tour, it was widely expected that his deal exceeded the $125 million figure that fellow golfer Dustin Johnson took. Reports later emerged that Mickelson's contract was worth $200 million, which was the largest contract issued by the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nLIV Golf, PGA Tour merger shines spotlight on 'sportswashing'\n\nOver the past six years, the term has been used to describe everything from the 2018 World Cup in Russia to a 2019 heavyweight boxing match in Saudi Arabia to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAnd at a news conference ahead of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league's first event last summer, it came up twice.\n\n\"Isn't there a danger,\" one reporter asked Phil Mickelson, \"that you're also being seen as a tool of sportswashing?\"\n\nThat term — \"sportswashing\" — is still relatively new. But the strategy it represents has been employed by governments around the world, in some form or fashion, for a century or more.\n\nFor world leaders, it is a way to improve their nation's reputation by hosting a prestigious sporting event, or financing a popular team. — Tom Schad\n\nWhat is going on with the antitrust lawsuit filed against the PGA Tour?\n\nIn August 2022, 11 players who left the PGA Tour for LIV Golf filed an antitrust lawsuit to challenge their suspensions from the PGA Tour.\n\nThis followed a report from the month before that the United States Department of Justice was investigating the PGA Tour for possible anticompetitive behavior. Augusta National Golf Club, which operates the Masters Tournament, the United States Golf Association and the PGA of America were later revealed to also be part of the investigation.\n\nSince then, lawyers on both sides have battled in various court proceedings to gain leverage. With the merger, however, both sides are mutually agreeing to end all pending litigation against the other.\n\nWho is on the PGA Tour board of directors?\n\nJay Monahan is currently serving as the PGA Tour commissioner and will retain a large presence after the merger. Ed Herlihy is serving as the 2023 PGA Tour policy board chairman and the co-chair of the board of directors. Jimmy Dunne is acting as the vice chair and senior managing principal on this year's board of directors. Under the merger, however, the board of the new entity will look a little different.\n\nAccording to the news release, PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will serve as chairman. Al-Rumayyan will also join the PGA Tour's policy board and will be part of the board of directors' executive committee. Monahan will serve as the CEO of the board of directors.\n\nAl-Rumayyan, Monahan, Herlihy and Dunne will all serve on the executive committee of the board.\n\n9/11 families group slams PGA Tour over LIV Golf merger: 'Paid Saudi shills'\n\nAn organization representing families of 9/11 victims ripped the PGA Tour's decision Tuesday to merge with Saudi-funded LIV Golf, describing the PGA and its commissioner, Jay Monahan, as hypocrites who have become \"paid Saudi shills.\"\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, 9/11 Families United said it was \"shocked and deeply offended\" by the news of the merger, which will see the PGA, LIV Golf and the DP World Tour all operating under a single business umbrella, funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The chair of 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, said she and the other family members who make up the group felt \"betrayed\" by the PGA Tour and Monahan individually.\n\n\"Mr. Monahan talked last summer about knowing people who lost loved ones on 9/11, then wondered aloud on national television whether LIV Golfers ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour. They do now — as does he,\" said Strada, whose husband, Tom, died at the World Trade Center.\n\n\"PGA Tour leaders should be ashamed of their hypocrisy and greed. Our entire 9/11 community has been betrayed by Commissioner Monahan and the PGA as it appears their concern for our loved ones was merely window-dressing in their quest for money — it was never to honor the great game of golf.\" — Tom Schad\n\nThe White House is staying out of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf partnership\n\nAs news of the PGA Tour's merger with LIV Golf spread, the White House is opting not to weigh in, when reporters at a briefing asked about the agreement in light of Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"I have no comment on that,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday during a briefing. — Joey Garrison\n\nAs PGA Tour and LIV announce merger, the current standings and top players on each tour\n\nLIV golfers Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson have been hard to miss near the top of major tournament leaderboards this year – especially with Koepka collecting his fifth major at the PGA Championship.\n\nBut what about all the other players who left the PGA for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour in past months?\n\nWith the surprise announcement Tuesday morning of the merger of the two tours' business operations, here's a look at the top 52 players of each tour in 2023. — Jim Sergent\n\nTune in for 'Full Swing' Season 2\n\nA producer on the Netflix docuseries \"Full Swing,\" which follows the lives of several men's pro golfers, said that the cameras were rolling when the news of the PGA Tour-LIV Golf agreement came through.\n\n\"You better believe we were filming when this broke,\" producer Chad Mumm wrote Tuesday in a tweet.\n\nSeason 2 drops in 2024.\n\nPGA Tour golfers frustrated they didn't know about deal with LIV Golf beforehand\n\nThe golf world was stunned by the PGA Tour-LIV Golf deal, and apparently, so were the ones on the tours.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday morning was a shocker since the PGA Tour and its players have been critical of the LIV Golf Invitational Series, primarily because it is funded entirely by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government, which has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners.\n\nWhen the announcement was made, PGA Tour golfers voiced their displeasure on Twitter with how they found out about the deal, with many saying that they found out through social media. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJack Nicklaus says PGA Tour-LIV Golf merger 'good for the game of golf'\n\nJack Nicklaus is thankful the infighting is coming to a close.\n\nNicklaus, who said he was offered but turned down $100 million to be the CEO of the LIV Golf series and said LIV Golf \"wasn't for me,\" reacted to the stunning news that the PGA Tour and LIV Golf will merge.\n\n“The last three years have been difficult for the game and the players,\" said Nicklaus, who lives in North Palm Beach. \"I spoke with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan this morning. He seemed pleased with the arrangement that will once again bring together the best players in the world. I agree that this is good for the game of golf.\"\n\nThis came just one week after Nicklaus spoke ahead of the Memorial Tournament about the LIV players who had decided to split off from the PGA Tour.\n\n“I don’t even consider those guys part of the game anymore,\" he said then. \"I don’t mean that in a nasty way. This is a PGA Tour event, and we have the best field we can possibly have for a PGA Tour event for those who are eligible to be here.

Pro golf will never be the same.\n\nFrauds, all of them. But frauds now united in the only thing that actually matters to the world of professional golf: Making money.\n\nIn the end, it didn’t actually matter to PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan that the money came from a country, Saudi Arabia, that treats human rights like an inconvenience. The tradition and history of the PGA Tour, in fact, didn’t matter all that much to those who argued that LIV Golf was an unworthy, unserious rival whose guaranteed money and 54-hole events were mocking competition.\n\nAnd as for the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Greg Norman, they did not, in fact, care all that much about growing the game. They wanted to own it. Now they do: The PGA Tour, brought to you by Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.\n\nThey sold out.

I think working together we can have a faster growth rate than it was for the past 10 or 20 years.\" — Casey Moore\n\nPGA Tour will retain oversight over tour\n\nAs part of the agreement, PGA Tour Inc. will remain in place as a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, which means it will continue to have oversight over its tour. During an interview with CNBC, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan offered more insight into the breakdown and Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan confirmed that PIF is prepared to invest billions.\n\n\"The c6 still stays in place and out of the c6 we’ll continue to operate our tours,\" Monahan said. \"We’ll put our player retirement plans and assets there. So that stays in place. One of the things that’s important to both of us is every single week we’re playing tournaments, we’re making a huge impact on the communities where we’re invited guests. That continues.\n\n\"At the c6 level — you take the assets of the PGA Tour, the PIF assets, and LIV and the Asian Tour and the DP World Tour, take all of those commercial assets and drop them down into that for-profit LLC … we’re going to go through an evaluation of all of the businesses and the PIF will invest … there will be additional investment and growth initiatives. That’s what’s really exciting here.\" — Casey Moore\n\nWhat has former U.S. President Donald Trump said about LIV Golf?\n\nDuring a pro-am event at his Trump National Golf Club May 25, Trump praised LIV Golf and defended his business relationship with the controversial Saudi-funded tour.\n\n\"They've been great for golf. The Saudis have been fantastic for golf,” Trump said then. “And they're going to make it a big part of, inside their country, they're going to do some great courses.\"\n\nLIV Golf also has upcoming stops scheduled at Trump courses in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Miami, Florida, later this year.\n\nAfter the news Tuesday, Trump celebrated the merger on his Truth Social platform, according to CNBC. “Great news from LIV Golf. A big, beautiful, and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf. Congrats to all!!!”\n\nIs the PGA Tour a nonprofit?\n\nWhile the merger announced the creation of \"a new, collectively owned, for-profit entity,\" the PGA Tour is retaining its position as \"a 501(c)(6) tax exempt organization.\"\n\nThe difference with the merger, however, is that — in the threat of continued disruption in men's professional golf — the PGA Tour reversed course and is aligning with the massive influx of Saudi capital.\n\nIn an interview on CBS in June 2022, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan ripped the LIV tour over links between the Saudi government and the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the interview, Monahan spoke about players who joined LIV Golf needing to apologize to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11 and asked: \"Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?\"\n\nWhat is LIV Golf?\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational Series made its debut in June 2022 after the tour lured some notable players from the PGA Tour such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Others like Brooks Koepka, the winner of the most recent PGA Championship, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith have since joined. The LIV tour presented a disruption in the dynamics of the sport.\n\nThe format of play of the tour also presented a shakeup to the PGA Tour.\n\nEvents were designed as 54-hole, three-round, no-cut competitions. LIV Golf incorporated shotgun starts to expedite play. Players were split into four-person teams. Purses were divided between individual placement and team placement, offering players more financial incentives to participate.\n\nWhat has Phil Mickelson said about the PGA Tour merger with LIV Golf?\n\nThough he has not made public comments yet, Mickelson, one of the most high-profile players on the LIV tour, posted a message on Twitter to celebrate the news of the merger.\n\n\"Awesome day today 😊,\" he wrote.\n\nWhy is LIV Golf so controversial?\n\nThe LIV tour drew criticism because it is funded entirely by the PIF, the sovereign wealth investment fund of the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\nWhat has been Tiger Woods' stance on LIV Golf?\n\nIn May 2022, Tiger Woods reaffirmed his commitment to the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Phil has said some things that I think a lot of us who are committed to the Tour and committed to the legacy of the Tour have pushed back against, and he's taken some personal time, and we all understand that,\" Woods said ahead of the 2022 PGA Championship. \"Some of his views on how the Tour could be run, should be run, been a lot of disagreement there. Obviously we're going to have difference of opinions, how he sees the Tour, and we'll go from there.\"\n\nLIV Golf CEO Greg Norman confirmed in August 2022 that the league offered Woods in the neighborhood of $700 million to $800 million to join the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nWhat have other notable PGA Tour golfers said about LIV Golf?\n\nA number of players who declined to join LIV Golf, such as Rory McIlroy, had been publicly outspoken in their criticism of the Saudi-backed tour.\n\n“There’s no room in the golf world for LIV Golf,” McIlroy said in July 2022. “I don’t agree with what LIV is doing. If LIV went away tomorrow, I’d be super happy.”\n\nWhat is the timeline of how LIV Golf got started?\n\nLIV Golf first teed off last June after rattling the golf world with the news that it would offer players larger purses backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. The inaugural tournament was held in London and then the tour traveled to its first stateside event in Portland.\n\nDustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Sergio García were among the leading PGA Tour players to leave for LIV. The PGA suspended the players for participating in the new series.\n\nLIV Golf was met with much criticism from Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and others for accepting support from a country with a history of human rights violations and for breaking tradition.\n\nAt the end of the first LIV Golf season, Johnson was crowned the champion, earning a prize of $18 million.\n\nIn January, LIV Golf signed a broadcast deal with CW Network to air 14 events of the 2023 season.\n\nA month later, the PGA invited LIV golfers to participate in the Masters.

He was invited to the Spanish club’s academy as an 11-year-old, had posters of Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo on the walls of his childhood bedroom, and had said he wanted to join the now 14-time European Cup winners last year.\n\nMbappé scored a goal at the Bernabéu Stadium in PSG's 3-2 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinal this year. Angel Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe Spanish giants submitted a $188 million bid for Mbappé in August. The deal was close to being struck, and the striker even admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.\n\n“I was honest. I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart,” Mbappé told CNN’s Becky Anderson in December.\n\nSo, when the Frenchman extended his contract with PSG instead of signing with Los Merengues, it was a shock – to say the least.\n\n“It was the hardest decision of my life,” Mbappé told CNN’s Amanda Davies on May 23. “I wanted to make the best decision … and that takes time … but I think I made the right decision.”\n\n‘The project is to win always’\n\nMbappé explained his decision to stay in Paris by repeatedly referencing the “project” being built at PSG.\n\nDespite drawing upon seemingly limitless reserves of money, PSG has so far failed to win a Champions League title, and has an unfortunate knack of imploding in the knockout stages.\n\nNow, it appears the club is altering its approach.\n\n“If I change all the things I want to change in the club,” said Mbappé before pausing and recalibrating. “If the club grows up with me, if I can write the history of the club collectively with the Champions League or individually too, I will be happy with this contract.\n\n“When they showed me this project, I was like, okay it’s interesting. And I want to try. I want to try again,” he said.\n\nMbappé was a crucial part of the French World Cup winning team, scoring a goal in the final as France beat Croatia 4-2. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nFollowing Mbappé’s decision to stay, other changes seem to be afoot at the Parc des Princes.\n\n“For sure there’s a lot of change that’s going to happen,” club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN’s Amanda Davies.\n\n“We want to create a new era of Paris Saint-Germain, a new project, fresh air. I think it’s really important that everybody gets motivated again.”\n\nIn a press conference announcing his contract extension, however, Mbappé denied that his new contract would give him added clout on or off the pitch.\n\n“As for the project here, you don’t need special responsibility to be invested,” he told reporters.\n\n‘Macron gave me good advice’\n\nMbappé was born and raised in Bondy, a suburb of Paris 11 kilometers from the city center and, aside from a two-year spell playing for Monaco, has lived in the French capital his entire life.\n\n“He’s Parisian. He’s French. He loves his country. He loves his club,” Al-Khelaifi told CNN. “So he plays for the club for five years [and] there’s a relationship. There’s love between him, the club, the fans, his country.”\n\nMurals dedicated to him are scattered around his former neighborhood where he has become a hero for young footballers there.\n\nOn the side of one building, a painting depicts a young Mbappé sleeping, dreaming about representing France. “Love your dream and it will love you in return,” a small caption reads.\n\nSince winning the World Cup in 2018, Mbappé has become a French cultural icon. Baptiste Fernandez/Icon Sport/Getty Images\n\nAs the figurehead of the French team, from a banlieue north of Paris, Mbappé’s value reaches beyond just his performances on the pitch, and into the political arena.\n\nSpeaking on the television show Chez Jordan, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo was effusive in her praise for the young striker.\n\n“Above all, I think that beyond football and results, he is so important, so useful to give hope to our young people… That’s why I want him to stay,” she said.\n\nEven the French President Emmanuel Macron intervened to implore the young star to stay at PSG and in France.\n\n“He gave me good advice,” Mbappé said, “but with all the respect I have for him, it was my decision. I took this advice but afterwards I took my decision.”\n\n“I’m staying and I want to give my best toward the history of the club and my country.”\n\nNew money v old money\n\nQatar Sports Investments (QSi) is the the owner of PSG and Al-Khelaifi sits on the board of the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the Qatari state-run sovereign wealth fund.\n\nSince the Qatari group – led by the Emir of Qatar himself – took control of PSG in 2011, the club has spent an estimated $1.5 billion on transfers, won Ligue 1 10 times, even if the Champions League title has proved elusive.\n\nJust six months before Qatar plays host to the World Cup, keeping the likely star of that tournament at the club owned by the Emir has been seen as huge coup.\n\nReal Madrid, according to The New York Times, offered Mbappé a signing bonus of almost $140 million, a net annual salary of more than $26 million and complete control over his image rights.\n\nBacked by vast reserves of state money, PSG countered with a similar signing fee but a far higher annual salary of $65 million, according to Sky Sports.\n\nMbappé, Neymar and Messi are all strikers for PSG. PAUL ELLIS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt signaled a rare occasion on which Real Madrid was unable to match a rival’s financial offer, and a victory for the ‘new money’ clubs bankrolled by the deep pockets of nation-states over the more established ‘legacy’ clubs with sprawling histories behind them.\n\n“What PSG are doing by renewing with Mbappé for a huge amount of money (who knows where and how it’ll be paid) after announcing losses of €700 million in the last few seasons and having a wage burden of €600 million is an INSULT to football. Al-Khelafi is as dangerous as the Super League,” Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, tweeted.\n\nTebas’ tweet echoed the views of his organization who issued an inflammatory statement once it seemed clear that Mbappé would be staying in France.\n\n“La Liga will file a complaint against PSG before UEFA, the French administrative court and fiscal authorities and European Union authorities to continue to defend the economic ecosystem of European football and its sustainability,” the statement read.\n\n“We know we are doing everything legally, everything in the right way,” Al-Khelaifi told CNN. “And we are very happy. Nobody will destroy our celebration of re-signing Kylian Mbappé.”", "authors": ["Issy Ronald Amanda Davies", "Issy Ronald", "Amanda Davies"], "publish_date": "2022/05/28"}]}

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019. Robert Larter\n\nIt suggests the Thwaites has the capability to undergo a rapid retreat in the near future, once it recedes past a seabed ridge that is helping to keep it in check.\n\n“Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernails, and we should expect to see big changes over small timescales in the future – even from one year to the next – once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed,” Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist and one of the study’s co-authors from the British Antarctic Survey, said in the release.\n\nRán, a Kongsberg HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle, near the Thwaites Glacier after a 20-hour mission mapping the seafloor.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nSee Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the “doomsday glacier,” which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change – something Graham said this study disproves.\n\n“Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,” Graham said.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/us/things-more-likely-to-kill-you-than-a-shark/index.html", "title": "Shark attacks are in the news again, but plenty of other phenomena ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlong both US coasts, Americans this summer have been hearing reports of shark bites and sightings, triggering beach closures and advisories.\n\nIn Long Island, New York, several people were injured in suspected shark attacks this month.

In Northern California, one man was hospitalized in serious condition last month after being bitten by a shark while swimming near Grey Whale Cove State Beach.\n\nBut even as encounters with sharks make headlines this summer, the risk of being attacked by the often misunderstood creatures remains low, and plenty of other phenomena are far more dangerous.\n\nCows and bees kill more people every year than sharks do, according to conservation group Defenders of Wildlife.\n\n“Your chances of being bitten are kind of like your chances of winning the Powerball,” said Marine Biology Professor Christopher Lowe, who is director of the Shark Lab at California State University Long Beach.\n\nIn other words: It’s not likely to happen.\n\nAlso, humans are a far greater danger to sharks than the sea creatures are to us.

Meanwhile, humans kill tens of millions of sharks every year.\n\nThings more likely than a shark to kill or injure you\n\n“You have a much bigger risk driving to the beach, or even getting caught in a rip current than you ever would from being bitten by a shark,” Lowe said.\n\nTo shed light on just how slim the odds of being attacked by a shark are, the Florida Museum of Natural History has a list of phenomena more likely to result in deaths and injuries.\n\nSo before you swear off going into the water on your next beach trip, here’s what to know:\n\nIn Florida, where the majority of US shark attacks happen, people were nearly 21 times more likely to die in a tornado (125 deaths) than a shark bite (six deaths) between 1985 and 2010.\n\nResidents of Florida and five other states with alligators were also more likely to die of a bite from the reptile (18 deaths) than a shark bite (nine).\n\nThere were 15,011 US bicycle fatalities compared to 14 shark fatalities between 1990 and 2009, which means Americans were over a thousand times more likely to die in a biking accident than a shark attack.\n\nLightning strikes killed nearly 76 times more people (1,970 deaths) than sharks (26) did between 1959 and 2010 in the Coastal US.\n\nSince 2004, rip currents were responsible for 45 times more deaths than sharks were.\n\nDogs killed more than five times the number of people (349) than did sharks (65) in the US between 2009 and 2018.\n\nInanimate objects have even killed more people than sharks have. In 1996, toilets injured 43,687 people, ladders injured 138,894 people, and 198,849 people were hurt by nails, screws, tacks, and bolts. In comparison, there were only 13 shark injuries and deaths during the same year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, there were 441 hunting fatalities, compared to seven shark bite deaths in the US and Canada.\n\nThese numbers aren’t meant to incite fear at the sight of dogs, toilets or ladders, but are instead meant to demonstrate just how uncommon shark attacks are.\n\nHas there been an increase in shark attacks?\n\nEven though the risk of being bitten by a shark remains extremely low, there was an increase in attacks in 2021, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\nAfter three years of declines, the number of reported shark bites went up in 2021, with a total of 73 unprovoked incidents reported worldwide, according to a January 2022 report by the museum’s International Shark Attack File.\n\nThe incidents included nine deaths globally, including one death in the US. A surfer was killed in a shark attack in California on Christmas Eve last year.\n\nThe numbers are on par with the five-year international average of 72 attacks annually, but represents an increase from the 52 attacks reported in 2020, when Americans hunkered down at home amid COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIt is common to see annual fluctuations in shark-human interactions, and despite a spike in fatalities in 2021, long-term trends show the number of annual shark bite deaths are decreasing, according to the Shark Attack File.\n\nThe US leads the world in the annual number of documented shark bites, with a total of 47 reported in 2021. Most of those attacks were in Florida, according to data compiled by the museum. Surfers and boarders made up more than half of reported shark bite victims.\n\nLowe said the increase can be attributed to climate change and rising temperatures driving more people to the beach just as shark populations are recovering and possibly swimming closer to shore to feed.\n\n“The country is warmer than it’s ever been. And that’s going to drive more people to the water than ever before, which just simply increases your probability of somebody getting accidentally bit,” the professor explained.\n\nStill, when taking into account just how many people are going into the water, the probability of being attacked by a shark is very low.\n\nWe’re not on their menu\n\nResearchers don’t really know for sure why sharks sometimes bite people. It’s possible they do it because they feel threatened and are just trying to defend themselves, Lowe said.\n\n“The number one thing people have to remember is that it is the shark’s home, and we’re guests in their home, and quite often, we’re not good guests,” the professor added.\n\nIt’s also possible sharks sometimes mistake swimmers and surfers for food. Sharks could see a hand or a foot in the water and mistake it for a small fish. A tiger shark or a white shark could even mistake a human for a seal or sea turtle.\n\nSome attacks are “cases of mistaken identity,” occurring under conditions of poor water visibility, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\n“People are bitten but rarely consumed, and that tells us that we are not on the shark’s menu,” Lowe said.\n\nSharks just don’t care about us\n\nLowe and his team at Shark Lab have been using drones to study how sharks behave around humans along the California coast.\n\n“After two years of looking at hundreds of hours of footage, basically, our conclusion is that sharks ignore people,” Lowe said.\n\nDrone video from Shark Lab shows sharks peacefully swimming near unsuspecting paddleboarders, at times close enough for the humans to lean down and touch them.\n\n“People have been taught to fear sharks, thinking that if the shark’s nearby it’s going to bite, and we know that is not true,” Lowe said.\n\nStill, shark attacks can happen on rare occasions, so it is good to remember if you ever encounter a one, turn towards it, so it knows you can see it, and slowly back away.\n\n“The ocean is a wild place. It’s not Disneyland, your safety is not guaranteed,” Lowe said.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your next summer beach trip!

The drownings happened on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts, as well as along the Great Lakes.\n\n“People consider the ocean a swimming pool and not a very dynamic, turbulent place,” said Francis Smith, a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. But nothing could be further from the truth, he said. “It’s powerful.”\n\nMore people die from surf zone incidents than any other single weather-related cause except flooding. Between 2014 and 2018, flooding killed 549 people. Currents, high surf and surprise waves killed 510, weather service records show. Nearly two-thirds of them were caught in rip currents.\n\nIn Florida, 102 people have drowned in the surf zone since 2014, including 27 in 2018 and 28 so far in 2019.\n\nThe 2014-2018 deaths, which span the entire United States and its territories, are greater than the combined number of fatalities by lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes over the same five years.\n\nThe count is a minimum, the weather service said, and may not include every death.\n\nBeachgoers face a far greater risk of drowning in a rip current than they do being bitten by a shark, said Stephen Leatherman, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Florida International University.\n\nAnd yet, Leatherman said the death toll “almost seems like a secret to some degree.”\n\n“People see one shark and everybody goes nuts,” he said. But twice as many people are killed by currents and waves in the U.S. than are bitten by sharks.\n\nLeatherman, also known as Dr. Beach for his annual ranking of the nation’s best beaches, calls the ocean’s strong currents “silent killers.”\n\nRECENT VICTIMS\n\nThe National Weather Service posts warnings about dangerous conditions in an effort to prevent such deaths. It did so throughout late September as Hurricane Lorenzo churned the waters from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 30, it advised beachgoers in Duck, N.C., that the risk of rip currents was high: “It is recommended that you stay out of the water.”\n\nBut Bill Lapenta did not heed the warning. Rescue personnel pulled NOAA’s director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction from the ocean unresponsive and could not revive him. “Surf conditions and a rip current in the area were likely a factor” in his death, according to a town news release.\n\nLapenta’s death was especially discouraging, Leatherman said.\n\n“Here’s a trained meteorologist, a leader who understands weather and waves, and yet he didn’t recognize them and got swept offshore and drowned,” he said. “If he’s that knowledgeable, what chance does the average person have who doesn’t have that training or background?”\n\nJohn and Suzi Merical know the answer to that question all too well. Their only child, Paige, was pulled out to sea in a rip current on April 19 during a beach trip to Emerald Isle, N.C.\n\nShe had been at the beach just 45 minutes when a stranger used Paige’s phone to call her mother to relay the horrific news. Although Paige was rescued and taken to the hospital, she died a week later from her injuries.\n\nA friend with Paige, Ian Lewis, was also swept away in the current and died.\n\n“It is the greatest nightmare I will ever experience,” said John Merical. “I’ve cried more tears in the last five and a half months than I have in my entire life.”\n\nThe two athletic teenagers were in water below their knees when the rip current knocked them down and pulled them out, he said. Paige, who started swimming at age 2, had been taught if she became trapped in a current to swim parallel to the shore, advice long given to swimmers.\n\nFLIP, FLOAT AND FOLLOW\n\nBut now the Mericals believe their advice was wrong. They are among a growing group of community organizations and researchers working to change the message.\n\nSwimmers should “flip, float and follow,” said Jamie Racklyeft, executive director of the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. Flip onto their backs, float with the current and follow the path of least resistance.\n\nRip currents form when water piles up on the shore and rushes to the lowest point to return to the sea. The water finds an existing channel or carves out a channel in the sand beneath the water’s surface, perpendicular to the beach.\n\nMany beachgoers have never heard of a rip current, said Leatherman, who’s working with his son to develop videos with drones and environmentally safe dyes to help people visualize the danger. The currents can be deceptive or hard to see, even for experts.\n\nMany swimmers aren’t strong enough to swim out of a rip current, Leatherman said. Drowning can happen quickly.\n\n“When you panic,” he said, “your brain stops working.”\n\nWhen a swimmer starts swallowing water, it immediately attacks the air sacs in the lungs, said Smith, the University of California scientist and former lifeguard. “Your body just shuts down,” he said. “You don’t get the oxygen you need, especially to your brain.”\n\nSwimmers who can flip over and float give themselves time to control their panic, breathe and make themselves more buoyant by filling their lungs with air. Once they’re calm, they can get themselves to shore or wait for rescue.\n\nThe drownings in North Carolina also have prompted renewed calls for additional lifeguards and other safety measures.\n\nIn Florida, which leads the country in surf zone drownings, only a fraction of the state’s 825 miles of beaches have lifeguards. But Leatherman points to the success of lifeguard programs like the one in Volusia County, Florida, home of Daytona Beach.\n\nOn Oct. 6 the county’s lifeguards rescued eight people from Lorenzo’s rough surf, including two later hospitalized as a precaution.\n\n“We’d like to see lifeguards everywhere,” Leatherman said, “but it’s expensive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/world/twilight-zone-luiz-rocha-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "In the ocean's twilight zone, this diver is discovering vibrant new ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN initiative in partnership with Rolex. Luiz Rocha is a Rolex Laureate.\n\nCNN —\n\nHundreds of feet below the ocean’s surface, somewhere between the dark ocean floor and the bright blue shallows, lies the twilight zone.\n\nIt’s a world of the unknown, but in some tropical and subtropical waters coral reefs thrive. Very few scientists have ventured to these deep reefs, known technically as mesophotic coral ecosystems, meaning “middle light,” and many assumed that the lack of light and chilly temperatures meant few species could exist there.\n\nBut one scientist has been diving into the inky depths to show there’s much more to life there than was first thought.\n\n“When you get up close, it’s a very colorful ecosystem,” says Luiz Rocha, Brazilian ichthyologist (a person who studies fish) and co-director of the Hope for Reefs initiative at the California Academy of Sciences. “There’s many different kinds of fish and many of them are unknown.”\n\nDespite its dimness, the twilight zone is home to fish of a stunning variety of colors, such as the Cirrhilabrus wakanda. Luiz Rocha / 2018 California Academy of Sciences\n\nRocha, whose studies focus on ocean life between 200 and 500 feet deep, was attracted to twilight zone reefs because of their mystery. “Every dive we do to those depths (leads to) a new discovery,” he says.\n\nTo date, he has identified around 30 new species – from a purple fairy wrasse named after the mythical nation of Wakanda, to the Tosanoides aphrodite, a pink and yellow reef fish named after the Greek goddess of love. But his deep-sea explorations have also proven that these reefs and the rainbow-hued species that roam them are under threat. His mission is to protect them.\n\nDiving in\n\nEntering the twilight zone is no easy feat. While it could be reached by submarine, this would be a clumsy way to study fish that flit in and out the shadows, says Rocha, comparing it to studying birds in a rainforest with a helicopter.\n\nScuba diving scientist shines a light on the world's deep sea reefs 04:07 - Source: CNN\n\nInstead he scuba dives, but the deeper he descends the more dangerous it becomes. Recreational diving is capped at 130 feet for safety reasons, but Rocha dives as far as 500 feet. To do this requires deep concentration, intense technical training and a strong dose of bravery.\n\n“What really makes this research special is that there’s only a handful of scientists in the world doing this,” he says.\n\nRocha usually dives in a group with two scientists and one safety officer. They spend hours preparing the kit, ensuring every piece of equipment is functioning well and that they are equipped to deal with underwater emergencies. The divers must use rebreathers, which recycle the gas exhaled by the diver, and a special breathing gas containing helium that is safe for deep dives.\n\nRocha and a team of divers prepare to explore the twilight zone reefs of the Maldives during a recent expedition. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\nGetting down takes just 10 to 15 minutes depending on how steep the reef is, says Rocha, but the ascent can take five to six hours to allow the body to decompress.\n\nAll that effort gives him just seven to 10 minutes at maximum depth, where he and his team look for fish, collect DNA samples and record the number of organisms in an area. If they think they have found a new species, they usually catch it and carry it up to the surface in a decompression chamber so they can study the specimen back in the lab.\n\nRelated: Ocean photographer Shawn Heinrichs wants to save the seas\n\nDespite having done it dozens of times, Rocha still feels the pangs of anxiety before each dive. The deeper you go, the darker and colder the water gets, he says. “But when we get there, we know why we’re there. When you see something that nobody has ever seen before … it’s absolutely amazing.”\n\nPlunge into the ocean twilight zone and you'll encounter an array of weird and wonderful species like nothing else found on earth.

The phronima will skewer salps -- a gelatinous invertebrate -- and hollow out their insides, before climbing in. Female phronima lay their eggs inside before climbing out and pushing the remaining carcass around, lending it the nickname \"pram bug.\" Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Bean's bigscale -- This fish lives towards the bottom of the twilight zone, and has been found as far down as This fish lives towards the bottom of the twilight zone, and has been found as far down as 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) beneath the surface. No looker, those bumps on its head are mucus-filled cavities. Known for its curious \"rowing\" style motion through the water, relying on its pectoral fins. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Glass squid -- Glass squid are filled with ammonium chloride, a solution lighter than seawater, allowing them to float through the ocean in search of food and mates. Born in the surface ocean, they grow to full size at fourth months and will enter the twilight zone. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Anguilliform leptocephalus -- Leptocephalus are tiny and grown up to become Leptocephalus are tiny and grown up to become glass eels . Despite their size (sometimes less than 5 mm), these skeletal creatures still partake in the nightly vertical migration into shallower waters -- the larger the leptocephalus, the longer the migration. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Barbeled dragonfish -- A fish with a fearsome mouth, the barbeled dragonfish has fangs embedded with nanocrystals that make its bite stronger than a shark, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Females have a bioluminescent lure dangling from their chin. Grows to up to 20 inches (51 cm). Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Strawberry squid -- Two eyes are better than one -- particularly in the case of the strawberry squid, whose eyes are different sizes. Its larger yellow eye is super-sensitive and picks out prey in waters above, while its smaller blue eye looks below for signs of bioluminescent fauna it will also eat.\n\n\n\nPaul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Slender snipe eel -- The snipe eel has a whole lot of backbone, with 750 vertebrae -- the most of any species on earth according to the WHOI. Their large eyes make up for a lack of bioluminescence when hunting for prey. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Fangtooth -- According to the WHOI the fangtooth has the highest tooth to body ratio of any fish in the ocean. In fact, it's able to catch fish bigger than itself. Sockets in the roof of its mouth prevent the fish's teeth from puncturing its own brain in the process. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Hyperiid Amphipod (Pegohyperia princeps) -- This crustacean is a This crustacean is a parasite to salps and other gelatinous creatures, and grow to just over one centimeter Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Transparent hatchetfish (Sternoptyx diaphana) -- The The hatchetfish has evolved so that it has pale blue lights on its underside, camouflaging it against the surface from any predators loitering below. And with eyes tilted upwards, it's ready to prey on creatures above it. Some species are known to swim up from 1,500 meters (5,000 feet) into shallow waters to feed at night. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanogra Helmet jellyfish -- Brainless and eyeless, the helmet jellyfish negotiates its surroundings thanks to a sensory \"bulb.\" The pigment giving its red tones is damaged by sunlight, so the sensor tells the creature when it should retreat into the darkness of the ocean twilight zone.\n\nPaul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Giant ostracod -- Although giant in name and more than 30 times the size of the average ostracod, this species is still only around an inch long. It has a slit-like mouth from which feathery antennae extend, which the ostracod uses to swim, feed and sense its surroundings. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Copepods -- This crustacean's rowing-like movement lends it its name -- copepod means \"oar-feet\" in Latin. It migrates up and down in the ocean by adjusting the density of fats in its body, staying low and out of predators' paths during the day.\n\nPaul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Bristlemouth -- There may be as many as a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) of these small fish in the ocean, making it the most abundant vertebrate on Earth. Bristlemouths do not take part in the nightly migration to the surface ocean. A clue as to why might be their swim bladders: while those creatures that make the migration have swim-bladders filled with air, the bristlemouth's is filled with fat.

But Rocha proved this wrong: “One of our first discoveries is that those deeper reefs are really not a refuge for shallow reef organisms. They are almost as impacted as the shallow reefs are,” he says.\n\nHe has found plastic trash and fishing gear in some of the deepest reefs and has observed the impact of overfishing and climate change. While there is not yet enough data to determine the scale of the damage compared to shallow reefs, he says it is clear that water temperatures are warming in the deeper zones too and causing reefs to bleach.\n\nThis year, Luiz Rocha identified the Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse. Yi-Kai Tea\n\nRocha hopes that his research can help to educate people about the twilight zone and inspire action to protect it. He works with policymakers, making the case for marine protected areas where these deep reefs lie. In 2019, the Hope for Reefs initiative was involved in the protection of a coral reef habitat on Maricaban Island in the Philippines, and the year before their research informed the establishment of two protected areas in Brazil.\n\nRelated: A shark ‘superhighway’ is being protected by fishermen\n\nRocha also works closely with local communities, collaborating with local researchers and giving local names to newly discovered species. For instance, earlier this year he and Maldivian biologist Ahmed Najeeb discovered a rainbow-colored fish which they named Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse, after the national flower of the Maldives, a pink rose called Finifenmaa. Rocha hopes this will “give ownership to the local people.”\n\nAhmed Najeeb (left) and Luiz Rocha inspect fish specimens during a recent expedition in the Maldives. Claudia Rocha / California Academy of Sciences\n\nRocha believes that technology will soon advance to a point that gives many more people access to the twilight zone and even more species will be discovered. But his main goal is that when they do, the ecosystems will look the same as they do now.\n\n“I don’t think it’s enough just to do the science,” he says. “We take many, many photographs … and we bring those stories back up to the surface and we share it with as many people as possible.”\n\n“For the most part, when people realize that those reefs are there, they move towards protecting them,” he adds.", "authors": ["Written Nell Lewis", "Video Hazel Pfeifer"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/weather/california-megaflood-study/index.html", "title": "Climate change could make parts of drought-prone California a \"vast ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Californians fear the “Big One,” but it might not be what you think.\n\nIt’s not an earthquake. And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nCNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“We find that climate change has already increased the risk of a (1862) megaflood scenario in California, but that future climate warming will likely bring about even sharper risk increases,” the study warns.\n\nMany of today’s major cities with millions of residents are built directly on top of the ancient flood deposits, Swain added, putting far more people in harm’s way.\n\nAbout 500,000 people lived in California in 1862. Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood.

Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/29/world/emperor-penguins-threatened-species-climate-scn/index.html", "title": "Emperor penguins at risk of extinction due to climate crisis | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Antarctica’s emperor penguins are increasingly threatened by the climate crisis, the flightless seabirds will receive new protections under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.\n\nWith global warming melting the sea ice the penguins depend on for their survival, the US Fish and Wildlife Service now categorizes the species as threatened. The federal agency lists “imperiled species as endangered or threatened regardless of their country of origin.”\n\nThe Tuesday announcement came more than a year after an initial proposal by the service to protect emperor penguins under the ESA.\n\nEmperor penguins rely on sea ice to form their breeding colonies, avoid predators in the ocean and forage for food. But as Earth’s temperature rises in relation to greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions, sea ice is at risk of disappearing.\n\nEmperor penguins are the largest and heaviest in the world. Bernard Breton/Adobe Stock\n\nWhen sea ice melts or breaks apart earlier in the season than expected due to global warming, entire penguin colonies can decline or disappear.\n\n“This listing reflects the growing extinction crisis and highlights the importance of the ESA and efforts to conserve species before population declines become irreversible,” said Martha Williams, US Fish and Wildlife Service director, in a statement.\n\nParts of the Antarctic Peninsula’s sea ice have melted by more than 60% in 30 years, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. And if emperor penguins suffer and decline, it’s likely that other species within the ecosystem are also at risk due to the climate crisis. Emperor penguins forage for krill, fish and squid in the sea, but they also serve as prey for leopard seals and killer whales.\n\n“Climate change is having a profound impact on species around the world and addressing it is a priority for the (Biden) Administration. The listing of the emperor penguin serves as an alarm bell but also a call to action,” Williams said.\n\nThere are about 61 emperor penguin breeding colonies along Antarctica’s coastline, which in total consist of between 270,000 to 280,000 breeding pairs (or 625,000 and 650,000 individual penguins, including juveniles), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The bird population is currently stable, but research has suggested that the emperor penguin’s population will decrease by 26% to 47% by 2050, or drop to 185,000 or 132,500 breeding pairs, according to the service.\n\nEmperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of the 18 penguin species. They can weigh up to 88 pounds (40 kilograms) and stand 45 inches (1.1 meters) tall. A female emperor lays one egg per breeding season, then passes it over to her male partner to incubate while she forages for food for about a two-month period.\n\nOnce the female bird returns, she shares parenting duties with her partner until their chick leaves the colony about 150 days after birth. The chick is then able to look after itself and set out for open water to forage. But first, the chick must shed its down before growing the waterproof feathers it uses to swim — if it’s still covered in down when the ice breaks, it’ll sink and drown.\n\nProtecting penguins\n\nListing the species as threatened now could help save emperor penguins from becoming endangered or extinct in the future.\n\nAntarctica's emperor penguin colonies could suffer if greenhouse gas emissions go unchecked. John Conrad/Corbis Documentary RF/Getty Images\n\nThe Endangered Species Act is “the world’s strongest environmental law focused on preventing extinction and facilitating recovery of imperiled species,” according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The polar bear was the first species listed as threatened due to climate change under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Since then, many of the world’s polar bear populations have stabilized, but they remain vulnerable as the climate crisis continues.\n\nThe listing can help establish strategies to increase the resilience of threatened species and reduce threats to their existence. For emperor penguins, this means international cooperation on conservation practices, increased funding for conservation efforts and likely more research into the species.\n\n“Listing emperor penguins as a threatened species is an important step for raising awareness about the impact of climate change,” said Stephanie Jenouvrier, associate scientist and seabird ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in a statement.\n\n“Emperor penguins, like many species on earth, face a very uncertain future, which is dependent on people working together to reduce carbon pollution. We should draw inspiration from the penguins themselves; only together can penguins brave the harshest climate on Earth, and only together can we face a difficult climate future.”\n\nA sentinel species\n\nEmperor penguins are an ideal species to study in a fluctuating ecosystem because their population numbers and behavior can indicate if something is wrong. By studying the birds, Dan Zitterbart, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and his team can learn about the impacts of the climate crisis in Antarctica.\n\n“Emperor penguins are a sentinel species that highlight the vulnerability of ice-dependent species in a rapidly warming world,” said Zitterbart. “Although they live far from human activity, the far-reaching effects of climate change present the most substantial threat facing the species’ survival.”\n\nSince 2017, Zitterbart and other researchers have been tagging 300 penguin chicks per year with a system similar to the way dogs and cats are microchipped. The initiative is part of the MARE project, which aims to measure the health of the Antarctic marine ecosystems through long-term monitoring of emperor penguin populations over the next 30 years.\n\nThe ECHO rover (right) slowly travels back after surveying the Atka Bay emperor penguin colony in Antarctica.

Microchipping the penguins allows the team to determine where the penguins go when they dive off the sea ice into the ocean and understand their foraging strategies. This insight can help determine the size of marine protected areas.\n\nIf greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, leading to warming temperatures and melting Antarctic sea ice, 98% of the emperor penguin population could all but disappear by 2100, according to a study published last year in the journal Global Change Biology.\n\n“The world needs to take aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and the Paris Climate Agreement objectives must be met, to help prevent further population declines,” Jenouvrier said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/us/mauna-loa-eruption-volcano-chasers-risk/index.html", "title": "Mauna Loa: As scientists in Hawaii carefully monitor the risks of the ...", "text": "Mauna Loa, Hawaii CNN —\n\nSince Hawaii’s Mauna Loa began erupting last week, photographer CJ Kale has sacrificed hours of sleep, rising before dawn to catch the volcano against the sunrise and working late into the night to capture its magnificent glow.\n\nFor years, Kale has been going to extraordinary lengths to photograph volcanic events, including swimming just feet from flowing lava as it cascaded into the ocean. He is among a handful of self-proclaimed “lava junkies” who are willing to put themselves at risk to witness volcanoes up close.\n\n“It’s kind of our fix,” he said. “It’s what gives us our excitement. It’s what gives us our adrenaline for the day.”\n\nAs a longtime lava chaser, he knows his threshold for what is possible has grown higher than most. “There’s definitely a range (of lava junkies) and my group of friends is definitely the far outer limits of that range. We push a little far, yeah, but I wouldn’t recommend pushing it far for everybody.”\n\nIn a photograph by Kale, lava can be seen flowing from Mauna Loa on November 29.

For those who try to venture close to the lava flow, however, the situation can be unpredictable.\n\nAs the slow-moving flow is advancing, its edges can cool into a rough, spiny surface which may seem secure, but its core still contains molten lava, Cheryl Gansecki, a geologist at the University of Hawai’i at Hilo who is studying the eruption, told CNN.\n\n“It might just look like a big wall of hot rock and it doesn’t look like it’s moving much, but they can surge where all of a sudden the front breaks off and lava comes spewing out.”\n\nDue to the eruption hazards, including dangerous gases and volatile conditions, the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park has closed the volcano’s summit and high elevation areas, as well as some nearby roads. Visitors are still able to see Mauna Loa – and its erupting sister volcano Kilauea – from several park overlooks and a viewing road that was opened along the Daniel K. Inouye Highway.\n\nPeople gather to observe the eruption of Mauna Loa on December 1. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nBut for Sherry and Curtis Grumbles, that’s nowhere near close enough.\n\nThe couple made a round-trip trek of four hours to see the towering head of Mauna Loa’s lava flow. They stood just yards from the crawling tidal wave, they said, describing the sound of bursting lava as like shattering glass.\n\n“You get a feeling of awesomeness, of how much power is coming,” Curtis Grumbles said. “There’s a two-story wall of lava just inching towards you, and you know there’s no way that anything’s going to stop it.”\n\nThe area technically is government property. It’s not only illegal to be there during closures, but dangerous because of unexploded military ordnance.\n\nDespite the known risks, the pair plans to hike the lava field again at night to see the “dramatic glow.”\n\n“You know, you can live caged up and have a pretty boring life or you can go see for yourself and take the chance and enjoy your life,” Sherry Grumbles said.\n\nScientists carefully study eruption’s movement\n\nMeanwhile, researchers with the US Geological Survey are making calculated visits to the eruption site. Clad in flame-resistant clothing, heavy boots and gloves, they carefully gather lava samples that may be key to learning what moves the eruption could take next.\n\nAfter “quenching” the lava samples in water, researchers bag them up and send them to the University of Hawai’i at Hilo where Gansecki and her colleagues are able to quickly extract valuable data that can help the agency model future behavior.\n\n“The composition of the lava can affect things like flow rates, so understanding rapidly what is in the rock can help predict how that flow is going to react in the real world,” said University of Hawai’i anthropologist Peter Mills.\n\nLava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.

It has been inching closer to the Big Island’s major Daniel K. Inouye Highway for days, though it is still about 1.8 miles from the roadway, the agency said.\n\nCurrently, no homes or businesses are threatened, but island officials and researchers are using the modeling to detect any developments that could cause communities to be at risk.\n\n“We’re kind of the first line of defense,” explained university geologist Steve Lundblad. “We can get information that’s quite good right away.”\n\nResidents of the Big Island have experienced the devastation of volcanic eruptions as recently as 2018, when Kilauea – a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern flank – erupted for months, destroying more than 700 homes in the Leilani Estates neighborhood and displacing residents.\n\nKale lost property in the 2018 eruption, and his mother has also had a property destroyed. But to Kale and many other residents, the risk is just a fact of life on the Big Island.\n\n“We don’t view it as loss. We view it as borrowed time,” he said. “We have this special time in this moment in this area that’s close to the volcano.

Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.\n\nScientists around the world have been studying nuclear fusion for decades, hoping to recreate it with a new source that provides limitless, carbon-free energy – without the nuclear waste created by current nuclear reactors. Fusion projects mainly use the elements deuterium and tritium – both of which are isotopes of hydrogen.\n\nThe deuterium from a glass of water, with a little tritium added, could power a house for a year. Tritium is rarer and more challenging to obtain, although it can be synthetically made.\n\n“Unlike coal, you only need a small amount of hydrogen, and it is the most abundant thing found in the universe,” Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct and a former chief energy technologist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNN. “Hydrogen is found in water so the stuff that generates this energy is wildly unlimited and it is clean.”\n\nHow is fusion different from nuclear fission?\n\nWhen people think about nuclear energy, cooling towers and mushroom clouds may come to mind. But fusion is entirely different.\n\nWhereas fusion fuses two or more atoms together, fission is the opposite; it is the process of splitting a larger atom into two or more smaller ones. Nuclear fission is the kind of energy that powers nuclear reactors around the world today. Like fusion, the heat created from splitting atoms is also used to generate energy.\n\nNuclear is a zero-emission energy source, according to the Department of Energy. But it produces volatile radioactive waste that must be stored safely and carries safety risks. Nuclear meltdowns, although rare, have occurred throughout history with wide-ranging and deadly results such as at the Fukushima and Chernobyl reactors.\n\nNuclear fusion does not carry the same safety risks, and the materials used to power it have a much shorter half-life than fission.\n\nHow could nuclear fusion power eventually turn the lights on in your house?\n\nThere are two main ways to generate nuclear fusion, but both have the same result. Fusing two atoms creates a tremendous amount of heat, which holds the key to producing energy. That heat can be used to warm water, create steam and turn turbines to generate power – much like how nuclear fission generates energy.\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe. The successful US breakthrough is a big deal, but it’s still on a far smaller scale than what’s needed to generate enough energy to run one power plant, never mind tens of thousands of power plants.\n\nThis illustration provided by the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory depicts a target pellet inside a hohlraum capsule with laser beams entering through openings on either end. The beams compress and heat the target to the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur. (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nWhy is DOE’s forthcoming announcement about a fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain important?\n\nThis is the first time scientists have ever successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, instead of breaking even as past experiments have done.\n\nWhile there’s many more steps until this can be commercially viable, it’s essential for scientists to show that they can create more energy than they started with. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much sense for it to be developed.\n\n“This is very important because from an energy perspective, it can’t be an energy source if you’re not getting out more energy than you’re putting in,” Friedmann told CNN. “Prior breakthroughs have been important but it’s not the same thing as generating energy that could one day be used on a larger scale.”\n\nWhere does the fusion take place?\n\nSeveral fusion projects are in the US, United Kingdom and Europe. France is home to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, on which thirty-five countries are collaborating – including main members China, the United States, the European Union, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the US, much of the work is happening at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, in a building that spans the size of three football fields.\n\nThe west gate entrance to the US Department of Energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 12, 2022.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second. The energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat.\n\nIn the UK and the ITER project in France, scientists are working with huge donut-shaped machines outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result. After fuel is put into the tokamak, its magnets are turned on and temperatures inside are raised exponentially to create plasma.\n\nPlasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The neutrons then escape the plasma, hitting a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and transferring their kinetic energy as heat.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nScientists and experts now need to figure out how to produce much more energy from nuclear fusion on a much larger scale.\n\nAt the same time, they need to figure out how to eventually reduce the cost of nuclear fusion so that it can be used commercially.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” said Chittenden. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nScientists will also need harvest the energy produced by fusion and transfer it to the power grid as electricity. It will take years – and possibly decades – before fusion can be able to produce unlimited amounts of clean energy, and scientists are on a race against the clock to fight climate change.\n\n“This will not contribute meaningfully to climate abatement in the next 20-30 years,” Friedmann said. “This the difference between lighting a match and building a gas turbine.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/us/colorado-river-lake-mead-drought-2023-climate/index.html", "title": "'The brink of disaster': 2023 is a critical year for the Colorado River ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDeep uncertainty looms over the Colorado River and the 40 million people who depend on it for their water supply as the basin enters a critical year that could determine its future stability.\n\nPlagued by decades of overuse and human-caused climate change, demand for the river’s water has vastly outpaced its supply. In 2023, federal and state officials must find a way to keep as much as 4 million acre-feet of water in Lakes Mead and Powell – 30% of what the Colorado River states have historically used.\n\nFailing to do so means either of these lakes, the largest manmade reservoirs in the country, could reach “dead pool” in the next two years, where the water level is too low to flow through the dams and downstream to the communities and farmers that need it.\n\nThe cuts that are needed are on an unprecedented scale, and officials will be fighting an uphill battle against a deep, multi-year drought to get them done. State officials tried drastic measures to cut their usage this year, but the river’s continued decline was an alarming reality check.\n\nWestern state officials wrote a letter in May agreeing to leave 1 million acre-feet of water in Lake Powell. Then, they watched as the same amount of water disappeared due to system losses and evaporation.\n\n“Everything we tried to do through the May 3 letter was wiped out by mother nature,” top Arizona water official Tom Buschatzke told CNN. “We have to understand that could happen to us again. It’s been happening to us almost every year for the past few years.”\n\nBureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton recently gave states a January 31 deadline to figure out a way cut their usage voluntarily. If they can’t do it on their own, top federal water officials have said they would step in and make mandatory cuts to save the system.\n\nExperts told CNN that even with a good winter and spring runoff season, water managers still need to plan for the worst-case scenario.\n\n“You can’t live with no water in the reservoirs hoping for good years; you need to refill the system,” Eric Kuhn, former manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, told CNN. “People realize that you can’t live on the brink of disaster.”\n\nThe looming battle\n\nThe All-American Canal flows near a section of the US-Mexico border in September. The canal, which draws water from the Colorado River, irrigates US farms along the Arizona and California borderlands with Mexico. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nAnxiety is growing in the West as reservoir levels plummet. Negotiations between the states on voluntary water cuts have been tense and closely watched, particularly between the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThose talks have stalled amid disagreement on how much water each state should sacrifice and how much money farmers, tribal nations and cities should be paid to reduce their water consumption.\n\nState negotiators are themselves waiting for the feds to decide how it will dole out $4 billion in drought relief money, which the Biden administration fronted from the Inflation Reduction Act to essentially pay people to not use water.\n\n“I would not say it has put anything on hold,” Buschatzke told CNN.\n\nBut, he says, “it makes it a little more difficult because of the uncertainty and not knowing” what the difference will be between the money the federal government is offering, and the voluntary cuts districts are willing to make.\n\nOther important deals have been struck. In November, the Biden administration pledged to spend millions of federal dollars to help restore California’s endangered Salton Sea – a key demand from the powerful Imperial Irrigation district in Southern California. With that funding, other states like Arizona are hoping Imperial and other California water users agree to put more cuts on the table.\n\nThere is also a distinct possibility that the federal government will step in if voluntary cuts don’t come close to what’s needed. But that plan would almost assuredly be greeted with a court challenge.\n\nSarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University, told CNN that federal officials are working carefully to prepare for the possibility that they would be sued over mandatory cuts, “so they can demonstrate it’s not an arbitrary action.”\n\nAt a December conference of Colorado River water users, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior Tanya Trujillo addressed that likelihood, according to Porter.\n\n“She said, ‘We know we’ll be sued,’” Porter said.\n\nCan’t bank on the weather\n\nVisitors watch the sunrise over a shrinking Lake Powell from Alstrom Point in Big Water, Utah, in September. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile West Coast states have seen a boon in precipitation in recent weeks – California snowpack is running around 150% of average so far this winter – the weather over the Colorado River Basin in the Intermountain West has been less wet. Snowpack in parts of the upper basin in Utah and Colorado is slightly above average, but lower basin mountains have seen below-average snow.\n\nOverall, the outlook from the National Weather Service’s River Forecast Center for the Colorado River Basin suggest springtime snow melt will be close to average.\n\nBut what the river basin needs is weeks of above-average snowfall, which melts in the spring and runs downstream to replenish the reservoirs. And ultimately, the Colorado River cannot be saved by the occasional wet winter amid growing, longterm drought.\n\n“This one good year is not enough to alleviate the stress on the Colorado River,” said Paul Miller, a hydrologist at the River Forecast Office. “It’s going to take multiple of these consecutive above-average years to fill a lot of the major reservoirs, especially Lake Powell.”\n\nAn icy Colorado River in February 2022 in Grand County, Colorado.

The ring shows how much the reservoir has fallen from its normal level. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAnd human-caused climate change is “almost certainly” going to make dry years worse, said Isla Simpson, climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\n\nSince the 1980’s, the Southwest region has seen a steady decline in precipitation. Simpson, who co-leads a federal task force on drought, said decades-long lack of rain and a rise in planet-heating emissions have worsened the conditions.\n\nDry air evaporates water from the soil during extended periods of heat. This is another reason water shortages are plaguing the Colorado River; not only is there enough rain to fill reservoirs, but the air also sucks up water from what’s left of them.\n\n“We need to be very concerned about the future of the Colorado River,” Simpson said.\n\nThere’s also a high chance that the lack of rain and low snowpack aren’t going away anytime soon, she said. La Niña is expected to persist through the winter, which typically causes the jet stream – upper-level winds that carry storms around the globe – to shift northward. That means less rainfall for a region that desperately needs it.\n\nAll of this means that even if there’s good snowpack this winter, the Colorado River’s existential problems are far from solved.\n\n“One good year doesn’t fix us – even a couple of good years doesn’t fix us,” Buschatzke said. “We’ve got to rebuild that bank account.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/world/wwii-shipwreck-leak-environment-scn/index.html", "title": "World War II shipwreck pollutes North Sea 80 years later | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The North Sea borders Belgium, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Germany — all of which were involved in WWII.\n\nThe study’s researchers estimate that, across the world’s oceans, shipwrecks from both world wars contain between 2.5 million and 20.4 million metric tons of petroleum products.\n\nShe hopes the data collected by the project will help policy makers decide the best steps in dealing with the North Sea’s wrecks and protecting its ecosystem.\n\n“The research performed within this project will be used to develop a decision-making tool to asses the potential environmental risk a war time shipwreck poses on the environment, which will hopefully contribute to a safe and healthier marine environment.”\n\nHeavy metals and toxic chemicals\n\nThe study team collected samples from the ship’s steel hull as well as the surrounding sediment. Researchers also gathered samples at a series of increasing distances from the ship in different directions to see how far pollution stretched.\n\nThe samples revealed heavy metals such as nickel and copper as well as arsenic and explosive compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, which are chemicals that naturally occur in gasoline, coal and crude oil, were also found.\n\nThe team uncovered the highest concentration of metals closest to the ship’s coal bunker, but it was also present in sediment that was deposited in the wake of the wreck. The samples with the most concentrated chemicals were also located close to the ship.\n\nThe wreckage has also influenced microbiology found around the ship. The team discovered Rhodobacteraceae and Chromatiaceae, microbes that degrade PAHs in sediment samples containing the most pollutants.\n\nThe sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfobulbia was also identified in samples taken from the hull, which is likely responsible for its corrosion.\n\nMarine impact evolves over time\n\nShipwrecks may become more dangerous to the environment as they age because corrosion can open up once enclosed spaces — which means their environmental impact continues to evolve, Van Landuyt said.\n\n“While wrecks can function as artificial reefs and have tremendous human story-telling value, we should not forget that they can be dangerous, human-made objects which were unintentionally introduced into a natural environment,” Van Landuyt said. “Today, new shipwrecks are removed for this exact reason.”\n\nIn addition to wrecks, the North Sea contains up to 1.6 million metric tons of ammunition like shells and bombs dumped after each world war ended.\n\nThese explosives, as well as other chemical warfare agents, can be toxic to marine life. Petroleum products are also known to impact the growth, reproduction, feeding and tissues of marine organisms, according to the study.\n\n“People often forget that below the sea surface, we, humans, have already made quite an impact on the local animals, microbes, and plants living there and are still making an impact, leaching chemicals, fossil fuels, heavy metals from — sometimes century old — wrecks we don’t even remember are there,” Van Landuyt said in a statement.\n\nThe study only contained an analysis of the V-1302 John Mahn shipwreck, but the researchers emphasized more shipwrecks in a variety of locations need to be sampled to have a better overview of their impact on the North Sea. Van Landuyt was surprised by just how many wrecks, including those that are almost intact, can be found there.\n\n“Remediation techniques (such as removing munitions by divers, pumping out oil tanks) are available but they are challenging and expensive to attempt,” she said. “The decision-support tool enables us to focus resources.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}]}

Upon arrival, Harry held a Bible in one hand as he was sworn in.\n\nThis is the first of several lawsuits to go to trial. He accuses the publisher of the Daily Mirror of using unlawful techniques on an \"industrial scale\" to get scoops. Harry has made a mission of holding the U.K. press to account for what he sees as its hounding of him and his family.\n\nOn the stand, Harry told Mirror Group attorney Andrew Green that he had \"experienced hostility from the press since I was born.\" The prince accused the tabloids of playing \"a destructive role in my growing up.\"\n\nHere's everything that happened in court.\n\nHarry's lawsuitsFrom phone hacking to aerial photos: What to know about all of Prince Harry's issues with the press\n\nPrince Harry takes the stand, testifies 'every single article' published about his family 'caused me distress'\n\nHarry was forced almost immediately to acknowledge that he couldn't recall specific articles he was complaining about. Green pressed him on how they could have caused such distress if he couldn’t remember having read them at the time.\n\n\"It isn't a specific article; it is all of the articles,\" he said. \"Every single article has caused me distress.\"\n\nGreen asked him to identify what evidence he had of phone hacking in specific articles, and Harry said he'd have to ask that question of the journalist who wrote it. He repeatedly said that the manner in which information had been obtained was highly or incredibly suspicious.\n\nHe said that it was also suspicious that some of the journalists had been known for hacking or invoices to third parties, including private investigators known for snooping, around the time of the articles.\n\nWhen asked how reporters could have hacked his phone for an article about his 12th birthday – a time when he admitted he didn’t have a mobile phone – he suggested they may have hacked the phone of his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\n\"That's just speculation you’ve come up with now,\" Green suggested.\n\nIn the same article, Green pointed out that a reference to him taking his parents' divorce badly was obvious.\n\n\"Like most children, I think, yes,\" Harry said.\n\nBut the prince said it was not legitimate to report such information and \"the methods in which it was obtained seem incredibly suspicious.\"\n\nGreen then pointed out that his mother previously made public comments to reporters about the difficulties of her children after the divorce.\n\nHarry also told the court he was distraught when he discovered Diana’s private conversations might have been hacked by the Mirror Group. He said he felt “sick” learning of payments by the newspaper to private investigators for information related to Diana.\n\nHe lashed out at TV host Piers Morgan, who was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004.\n\n“The thought of Piers Morgan and his band of journalists earwigging into my mother’s private and sensitive messages … three months prior to her death in Paris, makes me feel physically sick,” Harry wrote. He called it “vile and entirely unjustified behavior.”\n\nPrince Harry accuses tabloids of casting him in a role\n\nIn his witness statement, Harry claimed that during his adolescence and young adulthood, tabloids cast him in a role — “the ‘thicko,’ the ‘cheat,’ the ‘underage drinker,’ the ‘irresponsible drug taker.’”\n\n“I ended up feeling as though I was playing up to a lot of the headlines and stereotypes that they wanted to pin on me, mainly because I thought that, if they are printing this rubbish about me and people were believing it, I may as well ‘do the crime,’ so to speak,” Harry said. “It was a downward spiral, whereby the tabloids would constantly try and coax me, a ‘damaged’ young man, into doing something stupid that would make a good story and sell lots of newspapers.”\n\nHarry alleged that journalists’ behavior damaged his mental health, spurring “bouts of depression and paranoia ... I now realize that my acute paranoia of being constantly under surveillance was not misplaced after all.\"\n\nPrince Harry skips first day in court:What to expect when he testifies in phone-hacking case\n\nPrince Harry says some journalists have 'blood on their typing fingers'\n\nAfter leaving royal life in 2020, citing unbearable media scrutiny and alleged racism toward his wife, Meghan, Harry is on a mission to reform the British media.\n\nHis witness statement ends with a call to arms, calling for press regulation and accusing some journalists of having “blood on their typing fingers.\n\n“They claim to hold public figures to account, but refuse to hold themselves accountable. If they’re supposedly policing society, who on earth is policing them, when even the government is scared of alienating them because position is power? It is incredibly worrying for the entire U.K.,” Harry said.\n\nHe’s no fan of Britain’s Conservative government, either. “Our country is judged globally by the state of our press and our government — both of which I believe are at rock bottom,” he said.\n\nPrince Harry is the first British royal to testify since the 19th century\n\nThe 38-year-old son of King Charles III will be the first British royal since the 19th century to enter a courtroom witness box. He will face cross-examination by a lawyer for the defendant, Mirror Group Newspapers.\n\nHarry's showdown against the publisher of the Daily Mirror kicked off Monday but the royal did not show up in court due to a travel conflict as he was in Los Angeles celebrating his 2-year-old daughter's birthday Sunday. The judge was not happy.\n\n\"I'm a little surprised,\" Justice Timothy Fancourt said, noting he had directed Harry to be in court for the first day of his case.\n\nMirror Group Newspaper’s lawyer, Andrew Green, said he was \"deeply troubled\" by Harry's absence on the trial's opening day.\n\nPrince Harry's memoir 'Spare':His relationship with Prince William, more to know\n\nPrince Harry called British press the 'third party' in all his relationships\n\nSetting out the prince's case in court Monday, his lawyer, David Sherborne, said that from Harry's childhood, British newspapers used hacking and subterfuge to mine snippets of information that could be turned into front-page scoops.\n\nHe said that stories about Harry were big sellers for the newspapers, and around 2,500 articles had covered all facets of his life during the time period of the case – 1996 to 2011 – from injuries at school to experimenting with marijuana and cocaine to ups and downs with girlfriends.\n\n\"Nothing was sacrosanct or out of bounds\" for the tabloids, the lawyer said.\n\nIn a written witness statement published Tuesday, Harry said that he felt \"as though the tabloid press thought that they owned me absolutely.\"\n\n\"I genuinely feel that in every relationship that I’ve ever had – be that with friends, girlfriends, with family or with the army, there's always been a third party involved, namely the tabloid press,\" he said.\n\nHarry said in court documents that the royal family had assiduously avoided the courts to prevent testifying about matters that might be embarrassing.\n\nHis frustration and anger at the press, however, impelled him to buck convention by suing newspaper owners.\n\nThe Daily Mirror case is one of three Harry has brought alleging phone hacking and other invasions of his privacy, dating back to when he was a boy.\n\nTo the point:What actually happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nHe described his relationship with the press as \"uneasy\" in court documents, but it runs much deeper than that. The prince blames paparazzi for causing the car crash that killed his mother.\n\nHe also cites harassment and intrusion by the British press and \"vicious, persistent attacks\" on his wife, Duchess Meghan, including racist articles, as the reason the couple left royal life and fled to the U.S. in 2020.\n\nNews that British journalists hacked phones for scoops first emerged in 2006 with the arrest of a private investigator and the royals reporter at the now-defunct News of the World. The two were jailed, and the reporter apologized for hacking phones used by aides of Harry, his older brother, Prince William, and their father.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/06/07/prince-harry-court-testimony-phone-hacking-case-what-he-said/70297893007/", "title": "Prince Harry testimony: What he said in court for tabloid lawsuit", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nPrince Harry entered a London courtroom on a mission to prove that the publisher of the Daily Mirror tabloid had hacked his phone and unlawfully snooped on his life.\n\nHe left the witness box Wednesday having shown that he was highly suspicious of how Mirror Group Newspapers obtained information for stories about him, but without offering phone records or much other evidence to support his hacking claim.\n\n\"I believe that phone hacking was at an industrial scale across at least three of the papers at the time,\" the Duke of Sussex asserted in his second day of testimony in London's High Court. \"That is beyond any doubt.\"\n\nPhone hacking is central to his case against Mirror Group and two related lawsuits against other British tabloid publishers that he claims invaded his privacy by eavesdropping on emails and using other illegal methods to report on the smallest details of his life, causing him great emotional turmoil.\n\nHarry is the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court in over 130 years, and his high-stakes gamble in taking his cases to trial is unprecedented in modern times.\n\nWhy is Prince Harry in court?\n\nHarry has five active lawsuits that are directly related to the safety and privacy of his family.\n\nThe suit being heard in London's High Court – brought by Harry and other celebrities – alleges that between 1996 and 2011 the Mirror as well as The Sun and Daily Mail hacked into phone voicemails in order to access private information.\n\nHarry believes reporters used burner phone and destroyed records and that there's been a cover up of the hacking scandal. \"Finding out about this level of cover up is what makes me want to see my MGN claim through to the end, so people can really understand what happened,\" he testified Wednesday.\n\nThe prince's testimony kicked off Tuesday.\n\nWhat to know on Prince Harry's lawsuitsFrom phone hacking to aerial photos\n\nWhat Prince Harry said during testimony on Day 2\n\nIn addition to Prince Harry's desire to hold the newspapers accountable for a \"destructive\" role in his life and what he said was a cover-up of the hacking scandal, the pursuit indicates the seriousness of his larger mission to reform the press.\n\n\"Finding out about this level of cover up is what makes me want to see my MGN claim through to the end, so people can really understand what happened,\" he testified.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Mirror Group attorney Andrew Green pressed the prince to explain which elements of articles had come from hacking and how he could prove it without providing call data.\n\nHarry insisted that parts of certain stories were suspicious and said Green should consult the reporters who wrote the articles about what they did.

The High Court in London is currently hearing a case brought by Harry and other celebrities against Mirror Group Newspapers, owner of British tabloid Daily Mirror.

The hearing is expected to last four days.\n\nThe case alleges Associated Newspapers Ltd., which publishes titles including the Daily Mail, commissioned the “breaking and entry into private property,” engaging in unlawful acts that included hiring private investigators to bug homes and cars and record private phone conversations.\n\nPrince Harry sues tabloid for defamation after story on police security protection\n\n\"They were the victim of numerous unlawful acts carried out by the defendant, or by those acting on the instructions of its newspapers, The Daily Mail and The Mail On Sunday,\" attorney David Sherborne said in a court document.\n\nOther plaintiffs include John’s husband, David Furnish, and actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, who was also in court. Harry sat near the rear of the court Monday and took notes as attorneys discussed preliminary matters.\n\nSherborne said the intrusions by the tabloids were “habitual and widespread” and later “concealed or covered up.”\n\nArticles were falsely attributed to “friends,” a family source, palace sources, royal insider, or similar unnamed individuals to throw subjects “off the scent” of the true origin, Sherborne said.\n\nAmong the allegations in court papers were that Associated Newspapers unlawfully obtained the birth certificate of John and Furnish’s child before they saw the document and illegally gleaned information about Harry’s previous relationship with Chelsy Davy, a jewelry designer from Zimbabwe.\n\nOne article by The Mail on Sunday discussed a vacation the prince took with Davy to a private polo lodge in Argentina and weekends the two spent in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n\"The article also revealed paranoia and agitation I felt as a result of the paparazzi attempting to take photographs of Chelsy and I abroad,\" Harry wrote in a sworn witness statement. “This intrusion was terrifying for Chelsy: it made her feel like she was being hunted and the press had caught her, and it was terrifying for me, too, because there was nothing I could do to stop it and now she was in my world.”\n\nThe publisher is also alleged to have hired a private investigator to hack Hurley’s phone, stuck a mini-microphone on a window outside her home and bugged ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant’s car to gather financial information, travel plans and medical information during her pregnancy.\n\nThe allegations date back to 1993 and continue beyond 2018, Sherborne said.\n\nThe publisher said the claims are too old to be brought now and should also be thrown out because they rely on information the newspapers turned over in confidentiality for a 2012 probe into media law breaking.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'Anti-Hero,' Prince Harry's 'Spare' and the art of celebrity authenticity\n\n“It would be surprising indeed for any reasonably informed member of the public, let alone a figure in the public eye, to have been unaware of these matters,” attorney Adrian Beltrami said in writing.\n\nBritain held a year-long inquiry into press ethics after revelations in 2011 that News of the World tabloid employees eavesdropped on the mobile phone voicemails of celebrities, politicians and a teenage murder victim.\n\nOwner Rupert Murdoch shut down the newspaper amid a criminal investigation and public uproar.

He fumes at the U.K. media throughout his memoir “Spare,” published in January.

Edward VII was the great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's grandmother.\n\nFrom phone hacking to aerial photos:What to know about all of Prince Harry's lawsuits\n\nWhat is Prince Harry's history with phone hacking and paparazzi?\n\nThe Daily Mirror case is one of three Harry has brought alleging phone hacking and other invasions of his privacy, dating back to when he was a boy.\n\nIn court documents, he described his relationship with the press as \"uneasy\" in court documents, but it runs much deeper than that. The prince blames paparazzi for causing the car crash that killed his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\nHe also cites harassment and intrusion by the British press and \"vicious, persistent attacks\" on his wife, Meghan, including racist articles, as the reason the couple left royal life and fled to the U.S. in 2020.\n\nNews that British journalists hacked phones for scoops first emerged in 2006 with the arrest of a private investigator and the royals reporter at the now-defunct News of the World. The two were jailed, and the reporter apologized for hacking phones used by aides of Harry, his older brother, Prince William, and their father.\n\nHere's what to know:What actually happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nWho is Harry suing?\n\nThe duke is taking on three of Britain's best-known tabloid publishers.\n\nIn addition to Mirror Group Newspapers, he is suing Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and Associated Newspapers Ltd., which owns the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe claims are similar: that journalists and people they employed listened to phone messages and committed other unlawful acts to snoop on Harry and invade his privacy.\n\nWhat's the case against the Mirror Group about?\n\nAt the outset of the proceedings, Mirror Group appeared to fall on its sword, acknowledging instances when its newspapers unlawfully gathered information. It apologized in court papers and said Harry was due compensation.\n\nBut the admission involving Harry − the hiring of a private eye to dig up unspecified dirt for an article about his nightclubbing − wasn't among the nearly 150 articles between 1995 and 2011 for which he claimed Mirror Group reporters used phone hacking and other illegal methods to gather material. The trial is focusing on 33 of those stories.\n\nHarry's lawyer, David Sherborne, said unlawful acts by reporters and editors at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People were \"widespread and habitual\" and carried out on \"an industrial scale.\" He pointed the finger at management, in particular TV personality Piers Morgan, a former Daily Mirror editor.\n\nMorgan has publicly denied involvement in phone hacking, as has Mirror Group in its court submissions.\n\nMirror lawyer Andrew Green said a substantial proportion of the articles at issue involved a \"breathtaking level of triviality\" and that with the exception of a few instances of unlawful information gathering, the company's reporters had used public records and sources to legally obtain information.\n\nThe trial is a test case involving four claimants, including two members of Britain's longest-running soap opera, \"Coronation Street.\" But the verdict could determine the outcome of hacking claims also made against Mirror Group by the estate of the late singer George Michael, former Girls Aloud member Cheryl and former soccer player Ian Wright.\n\nThe case is broken into two parts: a generic case that lasted nearly three weeks in which Harry's lawyer laid out evidence of alleged skullduggery at the newspapers; the second part, starting Monday, with the four claimants testifying about specific acts targeting them.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/29/prince-harry-blames-royal-family-delay-london-tabloid-privacy-lawsuit/11564701002/", "title": "Prince Harry blames royal family for delay in tabloid privacy lawsuit", "text": "Brian Melley\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLONDON — Prince Harry blamed the royal family for a delay in bringing a phone hacking lawsuit against the publisher of The Daily Mail as lawyers for the newspaper argued Wednesday that the case should be thrown out because he didn't file it soon enough.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex said \"the Institution\" – a term he has used in other contexts to refer to the inner workings of Buckingham Palace – had prevented him from learning sooner about the activity of The Daily Mail and related publications by withholding information about phone hacking by other tabloids.\n\n\"The Institution made it clear that we did not need to know anything about phone hacking, and it was made clear to me that the royal family did not sit in the witness box because that could open up a can of worms,\" Harry wrote in a witness statement for his lawsuit.\n\nThe privacy invasion lawsuits by Harry and six other claimants, including Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, allege Associated Newspapers Ltd. commissioned the \"breaking and entry into private property\" by hiring private investigators to illegally bug homes and cars and record phone conversations.\n\nThe publisher denies the allegations.

They said they were misled when Associated Newspapers journalists falsely denied phone hacking and other means of gathering information for their articles.\n\nThe famous claimants said they learned of the unlawful activity after a journalist provided them with ledgers showing how much Associated Newspapers paid investigators. Some investigators have also come forward to admit hacking on behalf of The Daily Mail and related publications.\n\nPrince Harry criticized for tell-all, TV interviews. The power of taking back your narrative.\n\nOne of those investigators, Gavin Burrows, has since denied the work he had allegedly admitted doing for Associated Newspapers.\n\nHarry, who has several lawsuits against the news media, has vowed to make reforming the British tabloids his life's work. He blames an overly aggressive press for the 1997 car crash death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has accused reporters and photographers of hounding his wife, Meghan.\n\n\"I have always had an uneasy relationship with the press,\" Harry wrote in his witness statement. \"However, as a member of the Institution, the policy was to 'never complain, never explain.' There was no alternative; I was conditioned to accept it.\"\n\nWhile he said he was aware of some news from the phone hacking scandal, he hadn't realized for years how friends and associates were targeted. His decision to take a more aggressive approach came \"in the wake of vicious persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles concerning Meghan,\" he wrote.\n\nBeltrami, however, questioned how closely Harry was paying attention. He noted that the prince's best-selling memoir, \"Spare,\" describes taking a \"keen interest\" in the prosecution of News of the World journalists, which was the basis for the 2012 inquiry.\n\nPhysical attacks, drug use, Diana's death and more bombshells from Prince Harry's 'Spare'\n\nEvidence at a related trial showed they repeatedly hacked Harry's phone.\n\nHarry was \"overjoyed\" at the arrest of an editor and described his \"chipper mood\" at the \"death rattles coming from the most popular Sunday newspaper, (Rupert) Murdoch's News of the World. The leading culprit in the hacking scandal,\" Beltrami wrote in court papers.\n\nIn addition to seeking summary judgment, which would deliver a victory to Associated Newspapers without a trial, the publisher is also seeking to strike much of the evidence on which the claims are based.\n\nBeltrami has argued that the ledgers showing how much private investigators got paid were turned over by Associated Newspapers for the 2012 Leveson inquiry under a confidentiality agreement and therefore could not be used as evidence in court.\n\nAttorney David Sherborne, who represents Harry and the other famous claimants, argued that the documents were presumed to be public unless marked confidential. He said many of the documents had been used for investigative news articles about unlawful reporting practices by Associated Newspapers.\n\nMore:Will Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan attend King Charles III's coronation?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/uk/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-hearing-explainer-update-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Prince Andrew's sexual abuse lawsuit in the US: What to know | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nPrince Andrew is facing the prospect of a trial in a very public civil lawsuit for sexual abuse later this year, after losing his attempt to have Virginia Giuffre’s case against him thrown out.\n\nIt is an unprecedented situation for a senior British royal – the third child (and reportedly the favorite son) of Queen Elizabeth II – and sets up a dramatic series of legal proceedings that will attract attention around the world and could have major ramifications for Buckingham Palace.\n\nGiuffre alleges that she was trafficked by convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with the royal – claims that Andrew denies.\n\nGiuffre brought her case under the Child Victims Act, a state law enacted in New York in 2019 which expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more opportunities to seek justice. An attorney for Giuffre told CNN in August that filing the civil case was to show “all perpetrators of abuse should be held accountable.”\n\nShe is seeking damages “in an amount to be determined at trial,” as well as attorneys’ fees and other further relief “as the Court may deem just and proper,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nHis attorneys previously filed a motion to dismiss but that effort failed in early January.\n\nThe prince’s reputation has already been severely tarnished by his relationship with Epstein – and his friendship with Epstein’s former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in December for her role in facilitating Epstein’s abuse.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the case, and what comes next.\n\nWhat are Giuffre’s claims?\n\nGiuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, says she was forced to perform sex acts with Andrew. She says she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends – including the prince – at a time when she was underage (17) in the US.\n\nGiuffre says the assaults happened in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands, that Andrew was aware she was a minor at the time, and that she had been trafficked by Epstein.\n\nIn claims made prior to filing her lawsuit, Giuffre alleged that in 2001 Epstein brought her to London, where she was introduced to Prince Andrew and went dancing at a nightclub with Epstein, his then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell and the prince.\n\nIn a BBC interview broadcast in 2019, Giuffre said she had been taken to the Tramp nightclub where, Giuffre alleged, Andrew asked her to dance and was “sweating all over me.”\n\nIn court filings, Virginia Giuffre's lawyers said she had suffered \"severe and lasting\" damage. Lifetime\n\nAndrew, 61, has consistently denied the claims, telling the BBC in 2019: “It didn’t happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”\n\nHe claimed in the same interview that he could not sweat, due to a rare medical condition, and that on the night he is alleged to have had sex with Giuffre, he was in fact taking his daughter to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, southwest of London.\n\nGiuffre’s lawyers asked Andrew in court filings to provide documents proving both of those claims. But Andrew’s team responded that he was unable to do so, because he has no documents proving a medical condition that prevents sweating, and could not identity anyone he encountered at the pizza restaurant.\n\nWhere do things stand in the court case?\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed in August, Giuffre’s lawyers said the damage from the alleged incidents was “severe and lasting.”\n\nAndrew’s legal team asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, saying it violated the terms of a confidential settlement agreement Giuffre made with Epstein in 2009.\n\nThat settlement was unsealed on January 3; it shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault, and that Giuffre agreed to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge” parties and “any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant.” It does not explicitly name Andrew or any others.\n\nAndrew lost that effort on Wednesday; Kaplan ruled that “the 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, the parties intended the instrument ‘directly,’ ‘primarily,’ or ‘substantially,’ to benefit Prince Andrew.”\n\nIt was not the first attempt by Andrew’s legal team to have the lawsuit dismissed; in September his lawyers claimed the papers had not been properly served and that the case should be thrown out as a result.\n\nFor many legal experts, the writing was on the wall well before both sides presented their arguments to Judge Kaplan. Georges Lederman, special counsel in the white-collar defense and investigations team at the international law firm Withers, told CNN in mid-January motions to dismiss are “rarely successful.”\n\nHe explained: “All that a plaintiff need demonstrate to defeat the motion is that she has satisfied all of the elements necessary to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. That is a low threshold, and, as Judge Kaplan wrote in his ruling, Giuffre in her complaint has indeed satisfied all of the elements necessary to state a claim for sexual abuse.”\n\nWhat are Andrew’s legal options?\n\nThe beleaguered royal is now locked into a protracted and embarrassing legal battle that will undoubtedly cast a dark shadow over his mother’s platinum jubilee year when she’ll be celebrating her 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe case could now move towards the discovery stage, where both sides could demand disclosure of documents and reports that are needed to establish their claims or defenses, Melissa Murray, professor of law at New York University, told CNN earlier this month.\n\nMurray explained that during discovery “the parties may also be asked to sit for depositions or to provide written answers to interrogatories.”\n\n“Much of the evidence produced during the discovery phase risks becoming part of a public record as the case proceeds to trial,” she added.\n\nNow Andrew has until July 14 to potentially answer questions about the case under oath, following a ruling made by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan last year. The scheduling order signed by the judge in New York means that if lawyers for Giuffre want to question Andrew, they must do so outside of court and submit the interview by that date.\n\nWednesday’s filing appears to suggest Andrew’s intention to fight the case out in court. CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson said previously that this could be a risky strategy.\n\n“If he proceeds to trial, now the dirty laundry is aired,” Jackson said on January 12.\n\nThe other option is of course to settle, which is how most civil cases are resolved, according to experts.\n\nWhile it appears the duke hopes to clear his name and, in turn, restore his tarnished reputation, several legal analysts CNN has spoken to suggest an out-of-court settlement is the better option.\n\nWhat is Andrew’s legal defense?\n\nAndrew has denied the allegations against him, telling the BBC in 2019: It didn’t happen.”\n\n“Prince Andrew denies that he was a co-conspirator of Epstein or that Epstein trafficked girls to him,” his attorneys Andrew B. Brettler and Melissa Y. Lerner wrote.\n\nHe also denied he was a “close friend” of Maxwell and denied that he became a “frequent guest” in Epstein’s homes around the world. On other points, the attorneys write that the prince “lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations.”\n\nBut he did admit in the court filing that he met Epstein in 1999; that Epstein and Maxwell attended the prince’s 40th birthday party in 2000; and that Andrew was photographed with Epstein in Central Park and stayed at Epstein’s New York City mansion in 2010.\n\nAndrew’s attorneys have also attempted to shift the narrative, alleging in a blistering court filing in October that Giuffre’s claims are motivated by money. CNN contacted Giuffre’s lawyers in relation to the fresh claims; in their initial filings for the case, her attorneys said Andrew had inflicted “emotional distress” on Giuffre that was “severe and lasting.”\n\nHis legal team previously wrote in a blistering court filing in October that Giuffre’s claims are motivated by money. CNN contacted Giuffre’s lawyers in relation to the claims; in their initial filings for the case, her attorneys said Andrew had inflicted “emotional distress” on Giuffre that was “severe and lasting.”\n\n“Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense,” Andrew’s lawyers wrote in the documents filed on October 29 – the clearest sign yet that they are planning to go on the offensive as they battle to save the reputation of the Queen’s third child.\n\nThe documents acknowledge that Giuffre “may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein … and nothing can excuse, nor fully capture, the abhorrence and gravity of Epstein’s monstrous behavior against Giuffre, if so.”\n\nBut the papers also seek to paint Giuffre as money-driven and accuse her of “willful recruitment and trafficking of young girls for sexual abuse.”\n\nThey allege that Giuffre “was trained to and did, in fact, recruit other young women into Epstein’s sex trafficking ring,” and has since “milked the publicity for all she could,” a dramatic escalation in the case that hinted at an unsavory round of legal battles ahead.\n\nGiuffre’s attorney David Boies said in a statement Wednesday they looked forward to a trial.\n\n“Prince Andrew’s answer continues his approach of denying any knowledge or information concerning the claims against him, and purporting to blame the victim of the abuse for somehow bringing it on herself,” he said. “We look forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms. Giuffre for her own abuse at his deposition and at trial.”\n\nIn her lawyers’ initial filing, Giuffre said she feared disobeying Epstein, Maxwell and Prince Andrew “due to their powerful connections, wealth and authority.”\n\nWill Andrew have to face questions himself?\n\nAndrew has previously been accused of not cooperating with attempts to interview him as part of the investigation into the alleged sex trafficking ring Epstein and Maxwell are alleged to have operated.\n\nA spokesman for the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nAs Giuffre’s court case continues, he will likely have to reckon with the mid-July deadline to answer questions under oath.\n\nUntil then, though, he is not scheduled to appear in court and is unlikely to speak to the media about the case.\n\nIf the case goes to trial stage, legal experts suggest the ongoing pandemic will likely prevent him from appearing in person. “Courts are authorized to take testimony by remote means, but doing so in this case will depend much more on the status of the pandemic than any other factor,” said Lederman.\n\nThe prince stepped back from public duties and has kept a relatively low public profile since a much-derided television interview with the BBC’s Newsnight program in November 2019.\n\nWhat does this mean for the royals?\n\nThe long-running allegations facing Andrew have dramatically tarnished his public standing. In their motion to dismiss the case, his lawyers acknowledge his “sullied reputation.”\n\nThe scandal has wider implications for the royal family, which was simultaneously been forced to weather criticism over Andrew’s case and claim of racism from Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex over the past year.\n\nBritish tabloids often refer to the duke as the Queen’s favorite child, so his lengthy association with Epstein and Giuffre’s allegations against him signal a hefty fall from grace.\n\nThe royal family have made moves to distance themselves from the Duke of York as he’s continued to fight the allegations. He has been stripped of his royal titles and is now the only one of his siblings no longer referred to as His (or Her) Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace announced in a remarkable statement two weeks ago.\n\nAnnouncing the Queen’s decision, the palace statement made clear that Andrew will no longer have any royal public duties and will be defending himself as a private citizen in the allegations made by Giuffre.\n\nA royal source told CNN that all Andrew’s titles – his military affiliations and other royal patronages – were returned to the Queen effective immediately and will be redistributed to other members of the family.\n\nAndrew retains his own Duke of York title and he is still a member of the royal family, but, like the Sussexes, he will no longer represent the Queen in an official capacity.\n\nWant more details on the case against Prince Andrew and what the ongoing legal battle could mean for the Windsor clan?

However, the appeal was dismissed, with judges ruling that the Duchess of Sussex had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in regards to the contents of the letter.\n\nIn 2021, a High Court judge issued a ruling in favour of Markle, saying the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online had violated the Duchess of Sussex’s privacy by publishing excerpts of the private letter. The judge said Markle had a “reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private”.\n\nBack in 2019, Markle sued Associated Newspapers over five articles published in 2019 that reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.\n\nThe number of lawsuits the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched against the UK press now total five in the past three years.

Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror, has not commented on the allegations.\n\nThe Guardian expects this legal dispute to come to court this year, describing it as “another case that would pit one half of the Sussexes against powerful players in the tabloid press”.\n\nPrince Harry vs. the BBC\n\nPrince Harry complained to the BBC over the corporation’s decision to broadcast and publish online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a “race traitor” and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told The Guardian in September 2019 that the image, first shared in August 2018, had “caused his family great distress specifically while his wife was nearly five months pregnant”.\n\nThe BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the image’s use was clearly in the public interest. But the BBC did apologise for failing to warn the Duke of Sussex ahead of broadcasting and publishing the image.\n\nPrince Harry vs. Associated Newspapers\n\nIn 2020, Prince Harry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two “almost identical” articles published in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online which claimed he had “turned his back” on the Royal Marines after stepping away from frontline royal duties earlier that year.\n\nThe articles, published in October 2020, claimed he had “not been in touch by phone, letter nor email since his last appearance as an honorary Marine” in March, said the BBC.\n\nA remote hearing at the High Court in London on 1 February 2021 accepted the claims were “false”. The Duke of Sussex accepted an apology and “substantial damages” from the publisher. Jenny Afia, his lawyer, said he would donate the money to his Invictus Games Foundation for wounded warriors.\n\n“The baseless, false and defamatory stories published in the Mail on Sunday and on the website Mail Online constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke’s character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country,” said Afia.\n\nDuke and Duchess of Sussex vs. the BBC\n\nIn June 2021, the law firm Schillings issued a legal letter to some news broadcasters and publishers on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accusing the BBC of “false and defamatory” reporting.\n\nThe accusation related to a June 2021 article by the BBC’s royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, which claimed that the couple had not asked the Queen about naming their daughter Lilibet.\n\nDymond quoted an unnamed Buckingham Palace source who “disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth”.\n\nThe letter said the BBC report was “false and defamatory and should not be repeated”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/uk/royal-news-newsletter-05-06-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Harry and Meghan will be at the Queen's jubilee, but they're not ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the May 6 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family.

The wider family is traditionally invited to church services, like the one set for St. Paul’s Cathedral on the Friday.\n\nThe Queen’s attendance isn’t confirmed.\n\nHer Majesty is “looking forward” to the weekend and plans to take part in the celebrations, but “her presence will not be confirmed until much nearer the time or on the day itself,” a royal source told CNN.\n\nThe 96-year-old monarch has struggled with mobility problems in recent weeks and has been forced to miss several public appearances, including this month’s Buckingham Palace garden parties (more on that later…)\n\nShe’ll continue to play it safe for the jubilee and hasn’t confirmed whether she’ll be present at the various festivities.\n\nIt may be up to her family to represent her again, as they’ve been doing during recent engagements. Not getting a glimpse of the monarch may disappoint some of the fans in attendance, but it’s become a reality that the nonagenarian Queen has slimmed down her schedule.\n\nA party at the palace.\n\nWe already knew that a concert was planned for outside Buckingham Palace, following the jubilee tradition of hosting some big music stars on an impressive stage near the building.\n\nBut now we know what that stage will look like – and it’ll be quite something.\n\nImages of the stage outside Buckingham Palace were released on Friday. BBC Studio Events\n\nThe BBC has released an impression of the staging and it’s also been announced that 22,000 people will be able to attend. That includes 5,000 tickets reserved for key workers.\n\nTen years ago, the Queen watched from a royal box and made an appearance on stage as stars like Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder sang for the monarch.\n\nWe don’t yet know who will be performing this time around, but we’ll keep you updated as we hear.\n\nA flypast, a golden coach ride and a day at the races.\n\nA whole lot more is planned for the four-day weekend. It’s been confirmed that a Royal Air Force flypast will take place while the royals are waving to supporters on the Buckingham Palace balcony, a fitting climax to the Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\nThen, on Saturday, the racecourse at Epsom will stage the 243rd edition of its famous horse race, the Derby. The Queen, a keen horse breeder herself, has been a regular spectator at the event and has presented the famous trophy in the past.\n\nOn Sunday, streets across the UK will stage their own jubilee lunches. The palace said 60,000 people have registered so far.\n\nAnd back in London, the weekend will be capped with the Platinum Jubilee Pageant on Sunday. It will feature a reappearance of the Gold State Coach, which has been used at major royal events since it was built in 1762.\n\nThe Queen rode in the coach during her jubilees in 1977 and 2002, but this time she won’t be inside – instead, film footage of the monarch during her coronation in 1952 will be played in the windows.\n\nAnd there are more announcements to come between now and June 2. Keep your eyes on Royal News for all the details in the coming weeks.\n\nIN THE ROYAL DIARY\n\nThe Queen won’t attend her traditional summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace this year, another series of events the monarch is skipping as she suffers mobility problems.\n\nThree events will take place in the grounds of the palace on May 11, 18 and 25, with a fourth in late June at Holyroodhouse in Scotland, it was announced on Thursday. Because of the pandemic, this will be the first time the parties have been held since 2019.\n\nThe 96-year-old Queen will be represented at the parties by other members of the family, though the palace hasn’t yet confirmed which royals will attend.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II at a garden party in 2018 Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth has been forced to miss a number of events this year, including an Easter service last month.\n\nThe garden parties are a big part of the royal calendar, giving the monarch and her family the chance to meet with thousands of community leaders and celebrate their work.\n\nBut they do require long periods of standing and walking, and these are the kind of events that the Queen has had to skip in the past few months. She also hinted that she was left “exhausted” by Covid after catching the virus in February.\n\nThe Queen could still make it to next week’s state opening of Parliament, a ceremonial event in which the monarch unveils the government’s legislative agenda.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nNetflix drops Meghan’s animated series.\n\nNetflix has dropped Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s planned animated series “Pearl,” PA Media reported. The show was set to be produced in collaboration with Meghan and Prince Harry’s studio, Archewell Productions, but the streaming giant is understood to have dropped it as it cuts costs. According to a press release last year, “Pearl” was set to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl, who is “inspired by a variety of influential women from history.” Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year and lost $50 billion in share value last month after those figures were announced. It has other projects from Harry and Meghan still in the pipeline, including a “Heart of Invictus” documentary that tracks participants in the sporting tournament Harry founded.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge took the picture of the birthday girl.

The shot, which shows a smiling Charlotte relaxing in a field of bluebells, was taken by her mother in Norfolk, eastern England last weekend, according to the family. Charlotte is William and Kate’s second child, and fourth in line to the throne – just after her older brother, George, who turns 9 in July.\n\nWilliam urges action on male suicide.\n\nPrince William said society is “not really tackling the problem” of male suicide “as fast as we need to,” PA Media reported. During a visit to London mental health charity James’ Place, William asked workers how they get the message across to men that “some support is necessary.” The prince has long been an advocate for mental health causes. In a 2019 BBC documentary, he said he felt “pain like no other” after his mother, Princess Diana, died. “Particularly in Britain … we are nervous about our emotions. We’re a bit embarrassed at times,” he added.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Rob Munday\n\nThe Queen is one of the most photographed women in history. But rarely in formal photo shoots do we see her smiling, natural and unposed.\n\nWhen Buckingham Palace commissioned holographer Rob Munday to create the first official holographic portrait of Elizabeth in 2004, he snapped more than 8,000 pictures. That sitting produced a famous picture of the Queen, used on banknotes, postage stamps, and on the front cover of Time Magazine.\n\nBut it also included a more spontaneous shot, which sat unnoticed in his personal archives for almost 19 years.\n\nThe image shows a wry smile on the Queen’s face as she reacts to an amusing comment made by her friend and dresser, Angela Kelly, who was rearranging her clothing prior to the shoot.\n\nMunday rediscovered it while under lockdown in France and is now displaying it to the public for the first time.\n\n“I’ve completely forgotten about it. It’s lying on the hard drive for nearly 19 years.” Munday told CNN’s Robert Iddiols at the unveiling on London’s Park Lane. “But as I was thumbing through, right in the middle, there was just this one frame.”\n\nThe image was a happy accident, the result of test shots taken before the real thing.\n\n“My first thought was that it would make a beautiful image to commemorate the Platinum Jubilee,” Munday said.\n\n“I just loved it so much because it’s just a really, really natural portrait. I mean, a lot of people have told me that they’ve never seen a portrait quite like this of the Queen.”\n\nPHOTO OF THE WEEK\n\nAaron Chown/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nGo long!

The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\n\nPrevious lawsuit coverage:Duchess Meghan's lawyers want to settle lawsuit against British newspaper ahead of trial\n\n\"The claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The Mail articles interfered with that reasonable expectation,\" Warby said in his written ruling. \"Taken as a whole the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful. There is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.\"\n\nMeghan's lawyers argued that the Mail on Sunday and its publisher, Associated Newspapers, could not defend against her claims that the tabloid invaded her privacy and infringed on her copyright by publishing excerpts of her letter.\n\nShe is seeking damages for her claims, but that issue is still pending. She has said she will donate any money she receives to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nIt was another win for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their ongoing efforts to push back in civil courts against media coverage in Britain and in California (where they now live) that they consider invasive or abusive.\n\nIf the case had gone to trial, there was a strong possibility that Meghan, 39, would have to take the stand to testify, which could have been embarrassing for her and for the royal family, who rarely if ever testify in court.\n\nMoreover, her father, some of her friends and some former members of the Sussex staff in London were expected to be called to testify by the Mail on Sunday.\n\nMeghan issued a statement expressing gratitude to the courts for holding the tabloid \"to account for their illegal and dehumanizing practices.\" She said such tactics are not new and the world needs reliable, fact-checked news.\n\n\"What The Mail on Sunday and its partner publications do is the opposite. We all lose when misinformation sells more than truth, when moral exploitation sells more than decency, and when companies create their business model to profit from people’s pain,\" she said.\n\nMeghan said everyone has won from the result in her case.\n\n\"We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody’s privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years,\" she said. “I share this victory with each of you – because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better.\"\n\nAssociated Newspapers said it was surprised and disappointed by the ruling and is considering whether to appeal, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA lawyer for the tabloid, Antony White, argued in January at a hearing that Meghan had no reasonable expectation of privacy for her letter because “it’s to be inferred that the letter was written and sent by the claimant with a view to it being disclosed to third parties and read by the public.”\n\nMeghan’s lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, argued that that the publisher had “no real prospect” of winning because “it’s a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter” meant as a \"message of peace\" for her father alone.\n\nThe former American actress Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in May 2018 at Windsor Castle, a wedding watched by millions but not attended by her father, Thomas Markle, who said he was hospitalized for heart problems in California.\n\nAfter the wedding, Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, wrote to her father about their estrangement. This letter came to light when anonymous friends of the duchess mentioned it in a People magazine interview, and eventually the Mail obtained a copy from Thomas Markle and published parts of it in several stories in February 2019.\n\nShe filed her lawsuit in October 2019, arguing among other legal issues that publishing the letter without her permission violated long-established copyright law, which holds that the contents of a private letter belong to the writer, not to the recipient.\n\nAs the case moved through the British civil court, Meghan won some rulings and lost others. In May 2020, parts of her lawsuit were deleted in a ruling, leaving her the loser in an opening legal bout but keeping alive her core complaints of copyright and privacy infringement.\n\nThe issue of damages – who pays what to which team of lawyers and how much – will be resolved later.\n\nAlthough a trial is now off, revelations in case documents were eye-opening, including copies of messages between Harry and Thomas Markle prior to the wedding in which Harry urged Markle not to talk to the media. Other documents showed Meghan felt \"unprotected\" by the British monarchy during her pregnancy with baby Archie, born in May 2019.\n\nThe couple announced in January 2020 that they were stepping away from their senior royal roles and moving to North America to pursue more freedom, financial independence and privacy. They now live in Santa Barbara County as budding Hollywood producers, having signed deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce documentary and entertainment content.\n\n'Most epic experience': Harry and Meghan surprise young poets in online poetry workshop", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/11"}]}

Zhang considers the expectations of others to be a compliment, and she embraces the challenge, knowing deep down the results don't define her.\n\nIt's a mature-beyond-her-years outlook that should translate into staying power at the top of the game.\n\nZhang's highlight reel for the week included a chip-in birdie on a 29-foot curler on the par-5 13th in her opening round; a tee shot she nearly aced on the drivable par-4 16th on Saturday; and a recovery shot from the rough on Sunday that looked so good she ran to see it.\n\nThe LPGA hadn't seen a more anticipated American pro debut since Michelle Wie West in 2005.

She also receives the 500 CME points for the win, a rule that was changed in 2021 after the Sophia Popov uproar.\n\nZhang, who was playing the Mizuho on a sponsor exemption, became the eighth player since 1992 to win their first professional start on the LPGA, joining Hinako Shibuno (2019 AIG Women's Open) and Karrie Webb (1995 Weetabix Women's British Open).\n\nNow that she's an LPGA member, Zhang is also eligible for this year's Solheim Cup in Spain, captained by Stacy Lewis.\n\nZhang's historical debut carried plenty of drama down the stretch. After missing a birdie putt inside 5 feet on the 16th hole that would've given her a two-stroke lead, Zhang faced a 10-foot comebacker for par on the penultimate hole to maintain her advantage.

The Norwegian’s previous wins were in Mexico twice and Puerto Rico.\n\nIt was a crushing loss for McCarthy, one of the purest putters on the PGA Tour. He showed his touch by saving crucial pars and playing bogey-free on a day when the average score was just under 75. His only bogey came on the 18th hole — twice.\n\nRory McIlroy chipped in from below the fourth green for birdie and had the lead on the front nine, but he gave away far too many shots on the back — three bogeys in a row — for a 75 that took him out of the picture.\n\nScottie Scheffler closed with a 67 and finished third and missed the playoff by one shot, remarkable considering he made the cut on the number.

Go card!” Woods tweeted.\n\nZhang smiled broadly when told, adding she has not had a chance to look at her phone since the tournament ended.\n\n“My reaction says it all,” said Zhang, who said she did not look at a scoreboard until the 16th hole and did not know her position in the field.\n\nIt really never changed. She started in the lead and never lost it.\n\nSouth Korean rookie Hae Ran Ryu (70) was third at 8 under. Aditi Ashok of India, Ayaka Furue of Japan and Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea were at 7 under. Ashkeigh Buhai of South Africa, Leona Maguire of Ireland and Yuka Saso of Japan finished at 6 under, three shot behind the leaders.\n\nZhang shot a 2-over 74 in the final round and squandered a chance to win in regulation when she missed an 8-foot par putt after making at least a half-dozen clutch saves in a gritty final round performance.\n\nThe much-heralded 20-year-old from Stanford made a nearly identical 8-footer on No. 18 at Liberty National on the first playoff hole. Kupcho, who won an NCAA title at Wake Forest in 2018 and had a final round 69, also made a par.\n\nBoth players hit the fairway on No. 18 on the second playoff hole, but Zhang hit her approach from the fairway within 10 feet. Kupcho was short on her approach, her first putt went just over the back edge of the green and the second putt just missed. That left Zhang with two putts for the win.\n\nWhile disappointed to lose, Kupcho was happy with her performance.\n\n“On this grass I’m always the best,” Kupcho said. “We’re starting to hit in this type of grass going forward, so I’m excited to see where the season goes.”\n\nZhang held her face in disbelief after the winning putt fell as players celebrated with her by giving her red roses, similar to when she won the Augusta National Women's Amateur.\n\nZhang, who was playing on a sponsor exemption, did not have a birdie in her final round and finished at 9-under 279.\n\nZhang turned pro last week after the NCAAs and much was expected right away. She was the top-ranked women's amateur for 141 weeks and won every big women’s amateur event — the U.S. Women’s Amateur, the U.S. Junior Girls, the NCAAs and the Augusta National Women’s Amateur.\n\nThe victory was worth $412,500 and it also earned Zhang an automatic LPGA Tour membership, which she accepted — although she is skipping next week's event near Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/lpga/2023/05/26/rose-zhang-turns-pro-lpga-after-record-amateur-career-stanford/70261749007/", "title": "Rose Zhang turns pro, will make LPGA debut after record amateur ...", "text": "Rose Zhang is the winningest player in women's amateur golf history and, after outpacing Tiger Woods in her record-breaking career at Stanford, she will now take her talents to the big leagues.\n\nZhang, 20, announced Friday she will abandon her record 141 weeks as the top-ranked amateur in the world and officially turn pro. She will make her LPGA debut at the Mizuho Americas Open, which tees off Monday at Liberty National Golf Club in New York.\n\n\"Wow… it’s finally happening,\" Zhang, a sophomore, said with a melting face emoji on Instagram. \"The endless love, support and inspiration from so many people brought me to this point of my golf career.\n\n\"From my teammates to my coaches and trainers, to my friends and my family — you have all been integral in my journey, shaping me as a person and player while making sacrifices for my success. You have made it possible for me to pursue my dreams.\"\n\nShe is planning on playing in all four Majors this season and received an exemption from the United States Golf Association to participate in her fifth US Open in July, as well as an exemption from The R&A to play in the AIG Women's Open in Great Britain a month later. It will be her third time playing the latter after she won the Smyth Salver, awarded to the highest-performing amateur, in last season's tournament.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nBesides winning 12 tournaments in 20 appearances for the Cardinal — one more win than Woods had in his 26 appearances for Stanford — Zhang became the only player to win back-to-back individual NCAA Division I championships when she captured the title last Monday. The victory at Grayhawk Golf Club marked her eighth tournament win of the season, tied for the most in NCAA history, and came a month after she won the 2023 Augusta National Women's Amateur, completing the amateur grand slam.\n\n\"It's cliché to say, but I never dreamed of having the opportunity to coach the greatest female amateur of all time,\" Stanford coach Anne Walker said in a statement. \"Rose Zhang has led our team with class both on and off the golf course every day for two years. She's broken every record, won every championship and taken our team to the top of college golf.\n\n\"I'm quite certain I'll never coach anyone quite like Rose again — she's a generational player. Everyone at Stanford is better for having been around Rose and we are so glad she will be a Cardinal for Life.\"\n\nLast year, Zhang became the first student-athlete to sign a name, image and likeness deal with adidas.

The Stanford sophomore won her second straight NCAA title and then 13 days later was awash in wonder when she won the Mizuho Americas Open in her professional debut.\n\nWomen's golf has not seen this level of anticipation since Michelle Wie West turned pro at age 15 equipped with blue-chip sponsors like Nike and Sony.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nZhang walked, talked and played like it was any other tournament. She is so comfortable with who she is that expectations are not part of the equation.\n\n“I honestly didn’t even expect to make the cut,” she said Sunday evening as she sat next to a trophy stuffed with a bouquet of roses. \"And the reason why I say this is because I don’t think about my expectations a lot. I think about playing the golf course. I think about trying to shoot the best score that I can. The expectation for me winning did not even cross my mind.\n\n“I was just playing my game. I was having a good time out there,” she said. \"This is the game that I love, and I’m so thankful to be a professional doing it now.”\n\nShe became an LPGA Tour member with the win, important because she could not be considered for the Solheim Cup in September otherwise. Now she might as well be penciled in for the American team.\n\nShe earned $412,500, though money is not motivation and doesn't compare to endorsements with the likes of Callaway, Adidas, Delta, Rolex, Beats by Dre.\n\nBesides, Zhang has more pressing issues.\n\nShe made an appearance on NBC's “Today” show on Monday, then it was back to Stanford to move out of her dorm and get through finals. She will be a full-time player and still intends to finish a communications degree, just as Wie West eventually did.\n\n“I have no idea what I'm going to do with that,” Zhang said with a laugh, mentioning an essay that was due for one class, another project for computer science that sounded as though it gives her more anxiety that a downhill putt with a foot of break.\n\n“I have a busy week ahead of me, and that's not golf-related,” she said.\n\nHer next appearance inside the ropes is back in New Jersey on an even bigger stage than Liberty National, the course across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Zhang already was given an invitation to the KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol.\n\nAlso on the horizon the first full week of July is Pebble Beach, where the U.S. Women's Open is being held for the first time. It already was the most anticipated event on the LPGA schedule this year because of the location. Now it has even greater appeal.\n\nMegha Ganne, who challenged for a U.S. Women's Open title at Olympic Club as a teenager, was Zhang's teammate at Stanford. She was asked earlier in the week what the golf world should expect from Zhang.\n\n“More of what she’s already shown us in the past few years,” Ganne said. “I don’t think there is any part of her game or personality or game that’s lacking. She’s so ready for this. I’m just really excited for her. I think it’s going to be a joy to watch.”\n\nThat she was.\n\nZhang's debut came against a field that featured seven of the top 10 in the world. She had to sleep on the 54-hole lead — never easy, even for more tested veterans — and never trailed on a tough Sunday in which she never made a birdie.\n\nMost impressive was a 10-foot par putt on the 17th hole that kept her in the lead. She missed an 8-footer on the 18th to win in regulation, and then faced a sudden-death playoff against Jennifer Kupcho — a former NCAA champion and Augusta National Women's Amateur champion, and now an LPGA major champion.\n\nThe winning shot effectively was a 4-hybrid from Zhang that settled 10 feet away from a back pin on the 18th green. Ultimately, she needed two putts for the win. What followed was a celebration already familiar to those who have seen Zhang.\n\nShe was handed a red rose, and then another, and then another. Before long, she walked off the 18th with enough for more than one bouquet.\n\nThere were a few tears, especially during her embrace with Wie West, the tournament host who can relate to a high level of hype. Wie thought outside the box, playing PGA Tour events when she was still in the eighth grade, dreaming of playing in men's majors.\n\nThe difference was the outcome. It took Wie West four years to win on the LPGA Tour, five more to capture her lone major in the U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nWie West played with Zhang at the Women's Open last year and has become somewhat of a mentor to her.\n\n“It looks easy for her when she plays,” Wie West said.\n\nZhang exudes humility and kindness, along with a calculated approach to golf that led to her Stanford-record 12 titles in just 20 tournaments. And now she's 1 for 1 as a pro.\n\nWhat next?\n\n“I want to continue trying to carve a path for young kids to just follow your dreams,” she said. \"I’m so thankful that the young kids enjoy me, enjoy my golf, and I’m just so thankful for the support. So I will continue to do what I’m doing. I’ll continue to fight. I’ll continue to work hard.\n\n“Hopefully everyone can follow along.”\n\nThat shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/01/ncaa-champ-rose-zhang-makes-impressive-lpga-tour-debut-in-mizuho-americas-open-near-nyc/70279812007/", "title": "NCAA champ Rose Zhang makes impressive LPGA Tour debut in ...", "text": "TOM CANAVAN\n\nAP\n\nJERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Two-time NCAA champion Rose Zhang made her professional debut Thursday on the LPGA Tour, a solid opening round in the Mizuho Americas Open.\n\nThe 20-year-old from Stanford who dominated the women's amateur rankings for more than two years shot a 2-under 70 at Liberty National in the shadow of New York. The Californian was five shots off the lead held by Lauren Hartlage, who shot a career-best 65.\n\nAditi Ashok, the first player from India on the tour, was at 67 in a tournament where the focus shifted to Zhang last weekend with her announcement she was turning pro.\n\nAtthaya Thitikul of Thailand and Stephanie Meadow of Northern Ireland had 68s.\n\nAyaka Furue, coming off a loss to Pajaree Anannarukarn on Sunday in final of the match play event in Las Vegas, was at 69 with Lydia Ko, Brooke Henderson, Emma Talley, Cheyenne Knight, Grace Kim and Yuka Saso.\n\nLive Leaderboard: US Open Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nZhang didn't dominate in her first round as a pro but she showed enough, making five birdies and three bogeys on a day her putter didn't help her. She hit fairways and greens in a round on a course that features a par 3 played with the Statue of Liberty staring golfers in the face.\n\n“This was definitely a round that could have been better, and that kind of gets me excited to work on more and to develop my game even further,” said Zhang, who was among 14 players at 2 under. “I felt like I left a couple shots out there, and I think there is a lot of room for improvement.”\n\nThere were also some shots that were great. On the par-5 13th, she chipped in from 29 yards, coming from below the hole and having the ball cross the length of the green before falling in the hole.\n\nThe people following her group loved it. It was what they expected from the player who has won back-to-back Annika Awards as the best college player, and who won the Augusta National Women’s Amateur in April.\n\nHer eight wins this season tied Tiger Woods for the most by a Stanford player in school history, and her 12 wins in 20 college starts are a school record.\n\n\"I don’t really have to think about other people’s expectations,\" Zhang said. “Like I said before, I think of it as a compliment that they think I’m capable of more. But on the overall level, I think I have people that just want me to do the best I can and they push me to be better.”\n\nZhang will need to be better if Hartlage continues playing as well as she did on Thursday.\n\nStarting on par-5 10th, Hartlage ignited her career-best round by hitting her second shot to within a foot and making eagle. She added five more birdies over the final 17 holes, adding it was nice to play well after struggling in her last four events.\n\n“I feel like no one really expects me to be at the top, and it’s kind of fun just being able to just play with some of the best in the world and see how I rank,” said Hartlage, a 25-year-old who has two top-10 finishes since joining the tour last year.\n\nAshok, who has two top five finishes in her last three events, is two shots behind Hartlage after a bogey-free round.\n\n“I just know that if I play good four days, then I’ll have a pretty good chance,” Ashok said.\n\nThitikul has two wins and 21 top-10 finishes since joining the tour last year. The 20-year-old had five birdies and bogey and she was the only player in the top four who played in the afternoon, when the wind picked up.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/06/06/pga-tour-heads-north-to-canada-lpga-stays-in-new-jersey/70292750007/", "title": "PGA Tour heads north to Canada, LPGA stays in New Jersey", "text": "AP\n\nPGA TOUR\n\nRBC CANADIAN OPEN\n\nSite: Toronto.\n\nCourse: Oakdale Golf & CC.

It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.\n\nRed hues from the eruption of Mauna Loa illuminated Monday's predawn sky. Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/mauna-loa-highway-kilauea-eruption-monday/index.html", "title": "As Mauna Loa's lava inches toward a key Hawaii highway, some ...", "text": "Mauna Loa, Hawaii CNN —\n\nFrom a deep fracture in Mauna Loa’s dark terrain, the volcano’s magnificent eruption sends geyser-like fountains of lava spraying into the sky.\n\nThe fissure – cracked open on the northeastern slope of the world’s largest active volcano – feeds a searing flow of molten rock that cuts through the contours of Hawaii’s Big Island. Plumes of volcanic gas, including sulfur dioxide, rise into the air, and delicate strands of volcanic glass, called Pele’s hair, float downwind.\n\nIn the week since Mauna Loa erupted, the stream of lava has coursed northeast, away from the volcano’s summit. Once a quick-moving stream, the flow has slowed significantly as it reaches more softly sloping inclines.\n\nThough no communities are at risk, the lava flow is inching closer to the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, a major artery that remains open, connecting two sides of this island, according to the US Geological Survey. The lava is flowing at an average rate of 25 feet per hour, the agency said Monday.\n\n“Though the advance rate has slowed over the past several days, the lava flow remains active with a continuous supply from the fissure 3 vent,” the release said.\n\nAdvance rates of the lava may be “highly variable” in the coming days and weeks with individual lobes advancing quickly and then stalling, the release said.\n\n“If the eruption continues, it might cover the highway. But at this stage, it’s still about 2.3 miles away from the highway. But it is advancing every day,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the USGS at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. “We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened.”\n\nIf it closes, residents’ commutes could grow by hours as they seek alternate routes, creating “a tremendous inconvenience,” Hawaii Gov. David Ige told CNN on Saturday.\n\nHawaii’s Defense Department activated 20 members of the state’s National Guard Monday as a result of the lava flow from Mauna Loa, a Hawaii Emergency Management Agency statement said. The National Guard members will “assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” according to the statement.\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption has attracted waves of awestruck visitors, some making the pilgrimage in the middle of the night to avoid the crowds, bundled in jackets and hats to protect against the chilly night air.\n\nLava spews Sunday from a fissure on Mauna Loa, where heat rises and a sulfuric smell wafts a quarter-mile into the air. CNN\n\nAlso erupting now is nearby Kilauea, whose monthslong eruption in 2018 was one of the most destructive in recent Hawaii history, the USGS says.\n\nKilauea began erupting again in 2021 and hasn’t stopped. And though it poses no risk now to surrounding communities, Mauna Loa’s rare simultaneous eruption has rekindled memories of the pain and destruction Kilauea wrought four years ago, when it wiped out hundreds of homes and dozens of miles of road.\n\nMemories of past destruction resurface\n\nJust 21 miles east of Mauna Loa, Kilauea’s ongoing eruption is now confined to a lake of lava rippling at its summit. But the history of this volcano is painful for Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nIts 2018 eruption spewed lava into the large Leilani Estates neighborhood, swallowing more than 700 homes and surrounding others with thick layers of volcanic rock, creating unreachable patches of green foliage in a sea of blackened destruction.\n\nDorothy Thrall can still walk to the spot where her community once stood, now blanketed with hardened lava. From the deck of her friend’s home, she can see the edge where the lava stopped and blackened into volcanic rock, still steaming years afterward.\n\nAn area wiped out during the 2018 Kilauea eruption is seen Sunday from the sky. CNN\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption has reopened some of the wounds she and her friends still have from 2018.\n\n“I thought I was doing pretty good,” Thrall said. “My neighbor called me Day 2 (of Mauna Loa’s eruption), and she was in tears. She says, ‘I have PTSD, and I didn’t even know it.’ And I started crying, too, and I said, ‘I guess I do, too.’”\n\nThrall has no desire to see Mauna Loa’s eruption, saying she has seen enough lava in her time. Still, though, she still appreciates the majestic beauty and importance of volcanic events.\n\n“Lava is beautiful. It’s Pele’s creation,” she said, referencing the ancient Hawaiian volcano deity. “That’s how the island was formed. That’s how the island was built.”\n\nFor many Native Hawaiians, the eruption of volcanoes, including Kilauea and Mauna Loa, holds incredible spiritual significance. Some have honored this week’s occasion by leaving offerings and participating in traditional chants near Mauna Loa.\n\nAs onlookers and tourists flock, officials urge caution and advise people not to venture into closed areas that could pose risk of lethal volcanic fumes, sudden collapses and hidden earth cracks, the National Park Service said.\n\nA spot for safe viewing is a one-way route is accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said, noting vehicles parked on the roadway could get ticketed or towed.\n\nThe eruption has also created a risk of low air quality in some places due to volcanic ash and vog, or air pollution caused by volcanic gases.

As residents and tourists rush to witness and honor the rare dual eruptions, officials have enlisted the help of the National Guard.\n\n“Gov. David Ige and Maj. General Kenneth Hara activated 20 Hawai’i National Guard service members on Monday and placed them on active duty to assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said Monday.\n\nOfficials also created a safe viewing spot on a one-way route accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said.\n\nThe lava flow’s pace isn’t steady, so it’s challenging to predict exactly when lava might hit the major highway, also known as Saddle Road.\n\n“There are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advances are expected to change over periods of hours to days, making it difficult to estimate when or if the flow will impact Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThe last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984, when its lava reached about 4.5 miles from Hilo, the largest population center on the Big Island.\n\nIf or when lava from the current eruption reaches the critical highway largely depends on how long Mauna Loa erupts, a volcano expert said.\n\n“We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the US Geological Survey at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nMauna Loa and Kilauea are in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which remains open as it urges spectators to view the dual eruptions safely.\n\n“Stepping into week two of the Mauna Loa eruption,” the park posted Monday on Facebook. “Two volcanoes, two eruptions, one park.

While Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in 38 years this week, its neighbor Kilauea has been erupting since last year.\n\nDespite the dual eruptions, Gov. David Ige said it’s still safe to visit the Big Island.\n\n“We would encourage everyone who has plans to visit the island to continue,” Ige told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“It is completely safe. The eruption site is high up the mountain, and it’s in a relatively isolated location,” he said.\n\nBut distracted drivers gawking at the lava flows could cause problems, Ige said.\n\n“We are concerned because visitors and residents are stopping along the highway, and sometimes drivers are not paying attention fully,” he said.\n\n“So we are concerned about traffic control on the highway.”\n\nParking along the road is prohibited between mile markers 16 to 31, and any vehicles left there could be towed.\n\nIf the highway is closed, commuters won’t have any pleasant options.\n\nEmmanuel Carrasco Escalante, a landscape worker, said he would then have to decide between the northside or southside coastal roadways to get from Hilo to Kona.\n\n“It’s a hassle to drive all the way around the island,” he told CNN. “If the road closes, that would add almost two hours, more gas, and more miles so hopefully it (lava) doesn’t cross that road.”\n\nCarrasco Escalante said he usually leaves for work at 3:30 a.m. to arrive at 5 a.m. but is worried rerouting even then will take him into traffic jams.\n\nThe state’s emergency management agency tweeted there are no evacuation orders in place and if it becomes necessary to close the highway, there will be time to alert the public in advance.\n\n‘The concern is about dangerous gases’\n\nWhile officials have said there’s no imminent threat to property, a spate of potential health hazards could linger in the air.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the geological survey said. A field team has found Pele’s hairs across older lava flows, the agency said Wednesday, adding: “Hairs deposited many km (mi) from active vents by the windblown eruption plume.”\n\nState health officials have also warned about the possibility of vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe Hawaii health department warned residents and visitors about “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state.”\n\nChildren, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors if vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nThe governor acknowledged the potential for air hazards and said officials are tracking air quality monitors across the island.\n\n“The concern is about dangerous gases from the fissures. And the most dangerous is sulfur dioxide,” Ige said Wednesday. “Observing the volcano should occur at a distance. It’s not safe to get up close.”\n\nWhile evacuation orders have not been issued, Ige said he signed an emergency proclamation as a “proactive” measure.\n\nLast night I issued an Emergency Proclamation for the Mauna Loa eruption to allow responders to act quickly or limit access, if necessary, as the eruption continues. pic.twitter.com/j6Ky45Y6KE — Office of the Governor, State of Hawai`i (@GovHawaii) November 29, 2022\n\nThe proclamation “would make available all of the emergency responders, should it be necessary to active the National Guard, to help with control and keeping people away from the volcano,” Ige said. “Or should evacuations be necessary, that would just allow us to act quickly and promptly.”\n\nMauna Loa eruptions can be “very dynamic”\n\nWatch: CNN flies over the most active volcanoes in America 04:13 - Source: CNN\n\nAt 13,681 feet above sea level, Mauna Loa is the world’s largest active volcano.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the geological survey said earlier this week.\n\nThe eruption and lava flow have also cut off power and impeded access to a critical climate tool used to maintain the so-called “Keeling Curve,” which is the authoritative measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide and vital scientific evidence for the climate crisis.\n\nThe Keeling Curve graph comprises daily carbon dioxide concentration measurements taken at Mauna Loa since 1958.\n\n“It’s a big deal,” said Ralph Keeling, a geoscientist at the University of California in San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n\n“This is the central record of the present understanding of the climate problem.”", "authors": ["Holly Yan Aya Elamroussi", "Holly Yan", "Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Hawaii volcano: Mauna Loa's eruption creates rare dual-eruption ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe rare sight of two neighboring volcanoes erupting simultaneously became even more astounding Tuesday as new lava flows gushed down slopes on Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nMauna Loa, the world’s largest active volcano, erupted this week for the first time in 38 years.

A small, fourth fissure opened overnight and emitted a small amount of lava that cut both power and road access to the Mauna Loa Observatory facility, the agency said.\n\nThough there is no immediate risk to communities, Hawaii’s National Guard is on standby and the state Emergency Management Agency has activated its emergency operations center, Major General Ken Hara, adjutant general for the State of Hawaii Dept. of Defense said during a news conference.\n\nKilauea, a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern side, has been erupting since September 2021, though its lava is confined to its crater, according to the US Geological Survey. When the incredibly active volcano erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park remains open but cautions visitors hoping to witness the historic eruptions to be aware of the cultural significance the sites have for Native Hawaiians.\n\n“While an eruption is an exciting experience, keep in mind you are observing a sacred event.

This is the central record of the present understanding of the climate problem,” said Ralph Keeling, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and son of the Keeling Curve creator.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to find an alternative location for the equipment.\n\nThere have only been a few times when the readings from the tool have been unavailable, including in 1984, when they were interrupted by the last Mauna Loa eruption. During that incident, researchers had to install a generator in the observatory to resume operations.\n\nThis time around, Keeling said the situation is “much worse” and the timeline is unclear.\n\nVolcanic ash impacts air quality, flights\n\nHawaii health officials are warning residents about the possibility of \"vog,\" or volcanic smog.

So this was the best scenario for everybody because nobody’s in danger… So you just have to be thankful,” Deborah Westbrook, who had come to see the volcano during the day, said on Friday.\n\nBut, the lava flow from the Mauna Loa is gradually moving closer to the Daniel K.

Inouye Highway, is the fastest route linking the east and west sides of the island. Lava from Mauna Loa has been creeping toward the highway, coming within 3.6 miles on Wednesday.\n\nBut it could be a week before lava reaches Saddle Road, the US Geological Survey said Thursday.\n\n“Note, we just got a revised estimate based upon the flow-front location measured by our team on the ground,” the USGS tweeted. “Because of the spreading flow front and flat topography, it could be a week before it intersects the road.”\n\nWhat could happen\n\nLava fountains and flows illuminate the Big Island near the Mauna Loa volcano Wednesday.

But this is the first time in decades that both volcanoes have erupted simultaneously.\n\nState health officials have warned of potential air quality issues, including vog – or volcanic smog.\n\nResidents and visitors can expect “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state,” the Hawaii health department said.\n\nAnd plumes of dark clouds billowing out of the volcanoes aren’t smoke – they’re “volcanic gases, which are acid gases. You don’t want to breathe them in,” volcanologist Jess Phoenix said.\n\n“You’re talking hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide. These are all gases that are really not fun for average folks to breathe in, let alone if you have any sort of respiratory issue,” Phoenix said.\n\n“So the Hawaiian Civil Defense Authority and the US Geological Survey will closely monitor the volcanic smog … and they will let any communities affected know well in advance if people with respiratory issues should stay inside.”\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the US Geological Survey said.\n\nChildren, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors if vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nWhile evacuation orders have not been issued, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said he signed an emergency proclamation as a “proactive” measure.\n\nThe governor acknowledged Wednesday the potential for air hazards and said officials are tracking air quality monitors across the island.\n\n“The concern is about dangerous gases from the fissures. And the most dangerous is sulfur dioxide,” Ige said. “Observing the volcano should occur at a distance. It’s not safe to get up close.”\n\nVolcanoes are also erupting in Alaska\n\nMore than 3,000 miles to the north, officials in Alaska are also monitoring two erupting volcanoes in their state.\n\nBoth the Pavlof Volcano and Great Sitkin Volcano are experiencing low-level eruptions in the remote Aleutian Islands chain, said Cheryl Searcy, duty scientist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.\n\n“Pavlof has been erupting for over a year,” Searcy told CNN in a phone interview from Anchorage. “Roughly 15 months of activity, longer than any of the previous eruptions.”\n\nDuring that time, Pavlof – which stands at 8,261 feet– has not produced a high ash cloud, posing no threat to aviation, Searcy said.\n\nAs for the Great Sitkin Volcano, lava is still erupting in its summit crater, according to a report from the state’s volcano observatory. Searcy noted the 5,709-foot Great Sitkin has also been active for quite a while.\n\nResearchers are also keeping an eye on three other volcanoes that have shown signs of unrest, including the Semisopochnoi, Takawangha and Cleveland volcanoes.\n\nOverall, Alaska has more than 40 active volcanoes stretching across the Aleutian Islands chain.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Holly Yan", "Aya Elamroussi", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/weather/gallery/mauna-loa-volcano-eruption/index.html", "title": "Photos: Mauna Loa volcano erupts in Hawaii | CNN", "text": "Lava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.\n\nThe world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa, erupted in Hawaii for the first time in 38 years.\n\nThe eruption started late on November 27, sending lava down one side of the volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

Its always-on OLED display allows for quick checking of widgets that highlight useful information, such as baggage claim details at the airport or when packages are arriving (not unlike what’s been recently made available on the new iPhone 14 line with the lockscreen).\n\nGoogle (GOOG) said the Pixel 7’s screen is now 25% brighter for visibility indoors, and the device can go a full day on a single charge (or 72 hours when on extreme battery saver mode). It comes in three colors – obsidian, snow and lemongrass – and starts at $599, or $200 less than a baseline iPhone 14 with the same amount of storage.\n\n“We want people to give Pixel a try, so while phones in this tier typically start at $799, we’re starting the price at $599,” Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, said on stage during the event.\n\nThe larger 6.7-inch Pixel Pro – which comes in a matte aluminum finish – features an always-on display, the same long-lasting battery as the Pixel 7 and a new triple rear camera system, which includes a 5x telephoto lens, 30x super resolution zoom and an upgraded ultrawide lens. The ultrawide lens comes with autofocus capabilities to support new features including Macro Focus that picks up on fine details.\n\nThe new Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro Google\n\nBoth models run on Google’s new Tensor G2 processor, which powers the device’s machine learning and speech recognition capabilities, and several camera features. With Night Sight, for example, the camera now processes photos twice as fast. The tech also drives Cinematic Blur, a new dramatic blurring effect for videos.\n\nA new accessibility feature called Guided Frame helps visually impaired users take better selfies by vocally instructing them to move the device in specific directions. Google also announced updates to making calls, including cutting down on background noise and the ability to transcribe audio messages into text messages.\n\nThe Pro model, which comes in obsidian, snow and hazel, starts at $899. Pre-orders start on Thursday for both models and the devices hit shelves on Thursday, October 13.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel line remains a niche product. Its global market share for smartphones has never surpassed 1% on an annual basis, according to data from IDC Research. Google also limits sales to only a handful of countries, so keeping the volume low has been strategic as Google remains predominantly a software company with many partners running Android. (Google said the Pixel 7 line, however, will launch in sevral new countries, including India, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.)\n\nGoogle won’t likely take much market share away from Apple with these Pixel updates, as iPhone owners are known to be brand-loyal. Other Android smartphone makers, however, such as Samsung or smaller Chinese manufacturers may feel the pressure from consumer interest in Google hardware, according to Ben Wood, an analyst with CC Insight. “But given the incremental updates, it’s possible there will be less excitement than there has been in the past,” he said.\n\nAt the event, Google also teased another early look at its upcoming Pixel tablet, which will feature the Tensor G2 processor, and is expected to launch in 2023.\n\nBut one area where Google could make a greater impact this year is with the introduction of the Pixel watch. It is Google’s first wearable that plays up Fitbit’s strengths in health, fitness and wellness since closing its $2.1 billion acquisition of the smartwatch company early last year. Until now, Google had been quiet about how the Fitbit brand would integrate with its Wear OS software.\n\nThe Google Pixel Watch Google\n\nThe new 41 mm Google Pixel Watch features a circular, domed-shaped Gorilla Glass display that’s scratch- and water-resistant. It promises up to 24 hours of battery life and is compatible with Android 8 and newer devices. Built with Fitbit’s tracking capabilities, the Pixel Watch can monitor a user’s heart rate and sleep quality, offers 40 workout modes, and learns user behavior over time.\n\nThe device also assists with emergency SOS and supports a handful of Google services, including Google Wallet, Gmail and calendar updates, as well as sending messages and talking over 4G. The Pixel Watch comes in black, gold and silver finishes. It will cost $349 for Bluetooth and $399 for 4G LTE.\n\n“Pixel Watch poses zero threat to the Apple Watch, but it has an important role to play in raising the awareness of smartwatches for Android smartphone owners,” Wood said. “Given the success of the Apple Watch, there has to be a bigger market for smartwatches in the Android segment and together with Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, the new Pixel Watch should be a key driver for growth.”\n\nIt may take the Pixel Watch a few generations to catch up to the Apple Watch in terms of usability, however, as Apple’s smartwatch is now in its ninth iteration. But coupled with the Fitbit acquisition and the formation of Wear OS in collaboration with Samsung, Google is showing its greater commitment to the smartwatch market and perhaps hoping the time may finally be right for it.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/tech/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset/index.html", "title": "Quest Pro: Meta's newest VR headset is impressive but here's why ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nMeta’s newest virtual-reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro, is a slick, powerful device. It can display text and fine details in VR, making it possible to read even small type with ease. It can track your eyes and facial features, giving you a sense of connection with other people in virtual spaces: If you arch your eyebrows or they puff up their cheeks in real life, so too will the VR avatars. And it can be used as a mixed-reality headset, showing you a view of the world around you in color while letting you interact with digital objects — whether you’re painting on an ersatz easel or putting on a faux mini-golf course.\n\nBut the black headset, which Meta unveiled on Tuesday during an online event, is probably not in your price range. At $1,500 ($1,499.99, to be precise), it costs nearly four times that of the company’s cheapest Quest 2 headset. Its price, power, and potential are aimed more toward businesses — think architects and designers — with pockets deep enough to shell out for the headset, and some creative and die-hard VR users.\n\nBuyers can pre-order the Quest Pro as of Tuesday, and it will ship out on October 25. It can be purchased online directly from Meta, and in the United States it can also be bought at Best Buy stores, via Best Buy’s website, and through Amazon.\n\nMeta's latest VR headset, the Quest Pro, is aimed at business users and costs $1500. Meta\n\nThe capabilities of the Quest Pro mark an important milestone for Meta (and for CEO Mark Zuckerberg), which has spent years and billions of dollars steering toward a future where it believes people will spend more and more time in virtual spaces and mixing digital elements with the real world. The company’s VR unit, Reality Labs, is still tiny compared to its main business of selling ads on Facebook and Instagram, and costly: Meta said it lost $2.8 billion during the second quarter of this year because of Reality Labs.\n\nIt’s also a major strategy shift, showing the company is now pushing its best VR technology to business customers, hoping they’ll be eager to use VR and mixed-reality apps at work. It’s a plan that could be lucrative, though it risks alienating its consumer VR business (the company plans, from here on out, to have two Quest product lines and to use the higher-end one to decide which features to add to the less expensive one).\n\nThis shift may unnerve companies such as Microsoft and Magic Leap, which have been working for years to convince enterprise users that their pricier mixed-reality headsets represent the future of work. (Microsoft, maker of the mixed-reality HoloLens headset, is apparently hedging its bets by bringing its software to the Quest Pro and Quest 2, in a partnership announced Tuesday at Meta’s Connect event, which focuses on its latest advances in virtual reality and related technologies.)\n\nAnd it’s not clear whether — or how — this powerful device will help Meta popularize the so-called metaverse, which Zuckerberg believes so strongly in that he rechristened Facebook as Meta in 2021. Meta is the leader in the nascent VR headset market with its consumer-geared Quest 2 headset, but that market is still tiny compared to, say, console gaming.\n\nI spent several hours using the Quest Pro last week at a Meta office near San Francisco, coming away both impressed and flummoxed. It was quickly clear that it’s not intended to be a headset for the masses — a decision that will frustrate some Quest 2 owners waiting for an upgrade to the two-year-old headset. Yet it does offer a glimpse of what VR and mixed-reality experiences may be like in the coming years: better looking, more fun, and increasingly intuitive.\n\nEye and face tracking\n\nThe Quest Pro looks markedly different from the Quest 2, as Meta took the battery out of the main body of the headset, curved it, and moved it behind the wearer’s head. This, plus a dial on the back of the head strap that lets you adjust it precisely (making it much easier for those of us who wear glasses to keep them on in VR), gives it a layout reminiscent of HoloLens 2. The dial also makes it easier to get the headset on and off, especially if you have long hair.\n\nUnfortunately, this new layout may mean that some people find it less comfortable to wear, particularly over an extended period of time. With the increased weight behind my head and just a knob to adjust the single strap around my noggin, I had to keep adjusting it slightly. I wore multiple identical headsets over the course of roughly two hours; after six different demos, ranging from virtual painting to DJing, I left with a headache.\n\nThe Quest Pro comes with a charging dock that can power up the headset and controllers. Meta\n\nOne of the most noteworthy new features on the Quest Pro is its ability to track the wearer’s eyes and face — something that may make people feel more present when interacting with other avatars in virtual spaces. To do this, the headset uses five infrared sensors to capture details like where you gaze and whether you sneer, smile, frown, or raise an eyebrow. This tracking is turned off by default; Meta also said that it’s processing eye and face images on the headset and then deleting them, and that this will be the case even for developers who add this tracking to their apps.\n\nI tried this new tracking out while playing around with a demo of a green-faced alien character, named Aura, that Meta is making available to developers so they can get a feel for how it works. With the Quest Pro on my head, I could smile, sneer, wink, scrunch up my eyes, wiggle my nose, and so on, while Aura did the same, in real time (unfortunately, there is no tongue tracking). The responsiveness and specificity of Aura’s facial mimicry was impressive, even at this early stage.\n\nThis kind of tracking feels like a step in the direction of what Zuckerberg promised was coming after he was widely criticized online in August for a Facebook post featuring an image of his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Meta’s flagship social app, Horizon Worlds. Upon its release, Quest Pro users will be able to use it in that app and Horizon Workrooms, Meta said, as well as in several developers’ apps such as painting app Painting VR and DJ app Tribe XR.\n\nUpdated hand controllers\n\nThe headset is also more of a mixed-reality headset than a VR headset, as it isn’t meant to block out all ambient light all the time. This is a big departure from Meta’s past focus on immersive VR, where your physical surroundings were typically more of an obstacle than an asset. Meta is including magnetic light-blocking panels that can pop on to the sides to cut out more light, and starting in late November, it will also sell a $50 accessory meant to fully block out ambient light.\n\nLetting some surrounding light in is part of the company’s effort to make headset wearers feel in touch with their physical surroundings. To build on this, the Quest Pro uses outward-facing cameras on the headset to let you see your surroundings in color (rather than black and white, as on the Quest 2), and continues Meta’s recent push toward getting apps to interact with the real world.\n\nThe Quest Pro headset has sensors that can track your eyes and facial expressions. Meta\n\nThis was on display during a demo in which I used Painting VR to paint on a virtual canvas, moving around a real-world space set up with a virtual brush and tool stand on one side of the canvas and a shelf of paint cans on the other. I could mix paints, grab brushes, and post my finished (and admittedly awful) painting on the actual wall behind me, all while seeing what was happening around me and getting advice from the app’s creator.\n\nThe hand controllers that accompany the Quest Pro will also play an important role in both VR and mixed-reality apps, and they’ve been vastly improved over the ones that come with the Quest 2. Now, rather than relying on the headset to help determine where the controllers are in space, each controller includes three sensors to shoulder the load. This means they can track 360 degrees of motion, which should make for smoother and better hand and arm tracking in all kinds of apps. (Sadly, they won’t track your legs in VR, but Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that Meta will be using AI to bring full-body avatars into Horizon Worlds sometime in the future.)\n\nA pressure sensor on each controller enables more precise motions than with the current Quest 2 controllers. I tried this out with a demo in which I was able to pick up and toss around a variety of small objects like a teacup, blocks, and a garden gnome. I found that if I picked up the teacup gently, particularly by the handle, I wouldn’t harm it; if I grabbed it, however, I crushed it (I mostly crushed it).\n\nThe things the Quest Pro and these controllers can do without connecting to a powerful computer or setting up a slew of external sensors seemed impossibly far away when then-Facebook bought VR headset maker Oculus in 2014. At that time, most people didn’t even consider VR a mass-market technology; eight years and billions of dollars later, we know and expect more. The headset may deliver technologically, but it will be up to Meta’s customers to decide whether it’s worth the price.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/media/sean-hannity-donald-trump-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Analysis: What Hannity's newly unveiled texts reveal about him and ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nOkay, Sean Hannity, what are you going to do now?\n\nHe started his Tuesday night Fox News show by teasing a message to the “cowardly swamp creatures” in DC and the “media mob.” Throughout the show, Hannity hyped the segment, telling his audience, “You don’t want to miss it.” The suggestion, of course, was that he was going to issue a response to the January 6 Committee’s request for his cooperation in the insurrection investigation. But the promotion for the segment ended up being a head fake.\n\nIn the final moments of his show, Hannity instead delivered a rant on the lack of Covid testing availability. Which is to say that Hannity wholly ignored the 1/6 committee’s request and the damning revelations contained in the letter its top members sent to him. But he won’t be able to stay silent about it forever. After the show, his outside counsel Jay Sekulow issued a new statement: “We are evaluating the letter from the committee. We remain very concerned about the constitutional implications especially as it relates to the First Amendment. We will respond as appropriate.”\n\nFox Corp. also remained silent about what Hannity and other stars knew in the run-up to the riot and in the days afterward. Lachlan Murdoch and Suzanne Scott can dismiss Hannity as an opinion host all they want, but he should still be subject to some editorial standards…\n\nWhat it means\n\nHannity’s texts to Mark Meadows, disclosed by the J6 Committee, illustrate for the umpteenth time a clear breach of traditional news media ethics by Hannity. And they show, also for the umpteenth time, how Hannity operated during the Trump years behind the scenes as a shadow chief of staff. The new part, perhaps, is how ineffective he was!\n\nAs Jamie Gangel pointed out on “Don Lemon Tonight,” every line of the letter was crafted on purpose. So what about Hannity’s December 31, 2020 message to Meadows that said, “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.” Did Hannity try to talk Trump away from delusional thinking? If so, he failed. And what about the January 10 text to Meadows and Jim Jordan, saying, “Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days. He can’t mention the election again. Ever.” Clearly Trump doesn’t respect Hannity very much, since Trump’s past 12 months have been full of election lies.\n\nDeceiving the audience\n\nThe texts also prove – once more – that Hannity was dishonest with his audience. He likes to claim that he says the same thing privately as he says publicly. But that clearly isn’t the case. Privately, in these text messages, Hannity was expressing profound worries about Trump. But, publicly, those concerns were never conveyed to his audience. Instead, Hannity served as a loyal cheerleader of Trump until the end.\n\nBrian Stelter went off about that on Lemon’s show just now, highlighting Hannity’s January 10 comment to Meadows that “I did not have a good call with him today.” Stelter said: “On January 10, 11 and 12, what did Sean Hannity tell his viewers” about that call? “Did he inform them about Donald Trump’s mental health? About his state of mind? No. He lied and assisted the cover-up.” Stelter also pointed out that House members have many, many more texts from other Fox personalities. What else is going to be revealed?\n\nTrump: Hannity is wrong!\n\nWell, so much for this valuable friendship, eh? As CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reported, Trump put out a statement Tuesday evening objecting to Hannity’s January 10 assertion that he “can’t mention the election again.” Ouch. “I disagree with Sean on that statement and the facts are proving me right,” Trump said, though the facts are obviously not proving him right…\n\nWhat will Cheney say?\n\nWith the 1/6 anniversary on Thursday, Rep. Liz Cheney is booked on multiple networks this week, including Fox: She is slated to speak with Bret Baier on “Special Report” Thursday evening. She has not hesitated to call out Fox on the network’s airwaves in the past…\n\nStop calling it a news network\n\nOn a related note: I’ll reiterate that it’s time for actual news organizations to stop calling Fox a news network. It’s not. It’s a right-wing talk channel that has spent the past year misleading viewers about January 6 with a flood of lies and conspiracy theories designed to sanitize the events of that day. That has happened all while the network’s top hosts, as we now have evidence of, privately knew the truth about what happened. A news org’s primary job is to inform viewers with the best version of the truth.

The gauge for new orders was also in negative territory.\n\n“Due to the epidemic outbreaks, some companies in some areas temporarily reduced production or stopped production, which also affected the normal production and operation of both upstream and downstream companies,” Zhao said.\n\nSome companies also saw the cancellation or reduction of overseas orders due to geopolitical uncertainties, Zhao said.\n\nWeakening production and demand sped up the contraction in factory jobs, with the employment sub-index slipping to 48.6 in March, the lowest since February 2021.\n\nWorst since Wuhan\n\n“The PMIs probably understate the hit to activity last month,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.\n\n“The services index remained above the low of 45.2 that it hit last August during the Delta wave.

The CEH, which conducted the testing, is a non-profit consumer advocacy group focused on exposing the presence of toxic chemicals in consumer products.\n\nUnder California law — specifically Proposition 65, enacted in 1986 — the maximum allowable dose level for BPA via skin exposure is 3 micrograms per day.\n\nThe group also tested athletic shirts from brands that included The North Face, Brooks, Mizuno, Athleta, New Balance, and Reebok and found similar results.\n\nThe CEH said Wednesday it has sent legal notices to the companies, which will have 60 days to work with the center to remedy the violations before the group files a complaint in California state court requiring them to do so.\n\nTo date, the watchdog said its investigations have found BPA only in polyester-based clothing containing spandex. “We want brands to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols including BPA. In the interim, we recommend limiting the time you spend in your activewear by changing after your workout,” the group said.\n\nAthleta, Nike, Reebok, The North Face and Victoria’s Secret (which owns PINK) did not immediately provide a comment.\n\nBPA (Bisphenol A) is found in a large number of everyday products, from water bottles and canned foods to toys and flooring. In adults, exposure to BPA has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and erectile dysfunction.\n\nPremature death was also associated with BPA exposure, a 2020 study found. More recently, BPA has also been linked to asthma in school-age girls.\n\n“People are exposed to BPA through ingestion, from eating food or drinking water from containers that have leached BPA, or by absorption through skin,” Kaya Allan Sugerman, CEH’s illegal toxic threats program director, said in a statement.\n\n“Studies have shown that BPA can be absorbed through skin and end up in the bloodstream after handling receipt paper for seconds or a few minutes at a time. Sports bras and athletic shirts are worn for hours at a time, and you are meant to sweat in them, so it is concerning to be finding such high levels of BPA in our clothing,” Allan Sugerman said.\n\nOver the past year, the group has asked more than 90 companies, including Walgreens and socks and sleepwear brand Hypnotic Hats, to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols, including BPA. Some have already agreed to do so.\n\n“Even low levels of exposure [to BPA] during pregnancy have been associated with a variety of health problems in offspring,” said Dr. Jimena Díaz Leiva, science director with CEH.\n\nAlthough CEH litigates under California’s Clean Drinking Water and Toxics Enforcement Act of 1986, it says the repercussions of its settlements extend beyond California “as it is most often economically infeasible for companies to reformulate for just the California market.”\n\n“Our legal action has been successful in pushing entire industries to remove certain chemicals from products like children’s candy or toys,” the group said in a statement to CNN Business. “These cases not only serve to protect California consumers but also consumers throughout the country.”\n\n– CNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/business/foxconn-electric-vehicles/index.html", "title": "IPhone maker Foxconn reveals its electric car future | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nFoxconn, the Taiwanese company best known for building Apple’s iPhones, recently showed off two new electric vehicles at an event in Taipei as the company expanded on its plans to do for cars what it’s already done for phones.\n\nThe company, officially Hon Hai Technology Group but better known as Foxconn, hopes to build 5% of the world’s electric cars by 2025, chairman Liu Young-way said at the event, according to Reuters. His ultimate goal is to one day approach the the 40% to 45% share the company has in computer and smartphone manufacturing, he said.\n\nFoxconn has no plans to sell cars under its own name, just as it doesn’t sell Foxconn smartphones. Instead, it wants to build cars for other companies in much the same way that Europe’s Magna Steyr builds some vehicles for automakers such as Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar. The cars it unveiled are intended to show off Foxconn’s development and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIn the United States, Foxconn recently started building electric pickups in a Lordstown, Ohio, factory that used to make small cars for General Motors. GM sold the plant to Lordstown Motors, a startup company with plans to make electric pickups, in 2019. Lordstown Motors sold the factory to Foxconn earlier this year while Foxconn, in turn, agreed to build Lordstown’s electric pickup, the Endurance, there. Lordstown Motors announced the start of production on September 29, with customer deliveries expected to start later this year.\n\nTerry Gou, founder of Foxconn Technology Group, left, unveils the Model B crossover at an event in Taipei, Taiwan.

Another California-based startup, Indi EV, has also agreed to have Foxconn build its car, the Indi One, there. Aside from road-going automobiles, Foxconn has also agreed to build an electric farm tractor, the Monarch MK-V, at the factory.\n\nIt’s not clear how much, if any, of Foxconn’s own engineering is, or will be, in any of those cars. A spokesman for Fisker indicated the Pear may have some Foxconn components or software but will be largely CEO Henrik Fisker’s own design. The Lordstown Endurance pickup has no components from Foxconn, a spokesperson said, but the two companies have agreed to work together on future vehicles based on Foxconn engineering.\n\nFoxconn already has one EV ready for production in its home nation. The Model C will be sold as the Luxgen N7 there, with deliveries expected to begin in the second half of next year, according to Foxconn. Luxgen’s parent company, Yulon Group, and Foxconn created a joint venture called Foxtron in 2021 to develop and manufacture electric vehicles.\n\nThe Model C is described as a seven-seat crossover SUV. The newly revealed Model B city car, shown at the Taipei event, is essentially a smaller version of the Model C. The Model B was designed by Pininfarina of Italy, the firm best known for designing Ferrari models for decades but which also works with other EV companies like Vietnam’s VinFast. Pininfarina also designed one of Foxconn’s other electric vehicle prototypes, the Model E sedan, which was unveiled last year.\n\nFoxconn also showed off an electric four-wheel-drive pickup, which it boasts is the “first electric pickup designed and developed in Taiwan.” The Model V is a four-door, five-seat truck that, according to Foxconn, can carry one ton of cargo and tow up to three tons.\n\nVarious Foxconn companies are part of an large industry group called the MIH, or Mobility in Harmony, consortium, which is jointly developing the basic electric vehicle engineering platform that underlies Foxconn’s electric vehicles.

The features were unveiled at a company keynote event ahead of the all-important summer travel season.\n\n“The way people travel has changed forever,” Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement ahead of the event. Chesky touted the new features as “the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade.”\n\nThe updates come as Airbnb recently reported business was booming again after being clobbered by the pandemic’s hit to the travel industry. In its most recent earnings report, Airbnb posted quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion, up 70% from the same period last year.\n\nThe company said nearly half of the nights booked on Airbnb in the last three months were for trips of a week or longer. Chesky suggested the new Split Stays feature, which allows customers to book back-to-back stays at multiple home in the same area, is intended to meet this shift in demand.\n\nWith this option, which will automatically appear in search results, Airbnb users will typically see around 40% more listings when hunting for longer stays, the company says.\n\nAirbnb’s new way to search, dubbed Airbnb Categories, lets users look for places to stay using 56 categories based on a home’s style – including options for tiny homes and yurts – as well as location and proximity to a travel activity. Chesky said this new way to search comes after people have become “more flexible about where they live and work,” a trend that Airbnb has also embraced by allowing its employees to “live and work anywhere.”\n\nThe company also announced bolstered travel protections for guests, which will be included for free with every booking. Dubbed AirCover, the protections offer users similar accommodations or refunds if their booking was canceled, if they can’t check into a home, or if the listing wasn’t as advertised. Moreover, the company said customers will get access to a 24-hour safety line if they ever feel unsafe during their stay.\n\nWednesday’s updates come after the company previously announced “strict anti-party measures” ahead of the summer holidays, marking its latest attempt to crack down on people seeking to use its platform to host unauthorized ragers.

Moderna hopes to roll out a single-dose annual booster to cover the coronavirus, the flu and another common respiratory virus within the next five years.\n\nAs Covid-19 continues to mutate, Moderna will need to keep updating the vaccines that turned it into a global household name while trying to make it more convenient for consumers, CEO Stéphane Bancel said in an interview with CNN Business Wednesday.\n\nHe estimated a timeline of “three to five years” for the new combined product, and likened the development of the life-saving jab to that of a smartphone.\n\n“You don’t get the amazing camera, amazing everything the first time you get an iPhone, but you get a lot of things,” he said.\n\n“A lot of us buy a new iPhone every September, and you get new apps and you get refreshed apps. And that’s exactly the same idea, which is you’ll get Covid and flu and RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] in your single dose.”\n\nHaving recorded breakneck growth during the pandemic, Moderna (MRNA) is now under pressure to identify its next big frontier.\n\nBancel believes the Covid-19 pandemic that helped the company rack up tens of billions of dollars in revenue and generate business in more than 70 markets globally could end as soon as this year.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the virus is going anywhere, he noted.\n\n“I think we are slowly moving — if not already in some countries — to a world where all the tools are available, and everybody can make their own decision based on their risk tolerance,” he explained, adding that he believed more people would choose to “live with the virus,” much like they do with the flu.\n\nThe approach, however, will continue to vary greatly, such as among people who are immunocompromised or in countries like Japan, where it was common to wear masks even before the pandemic, he acknowledged.\n\nAnd “there’s always a 20% probability that we get a very nasty variant that drives very severe disease that has a lot of mutation,” he added.\n\nThe next big thing\n\nStill, Moderna is determined not to become a one-hit wonder.\n\nThe company has more than 40 products in development, and is planning for life well beyond Covid-19, said Bancel.\n\nIn addition to an updated annual booster, it is continuing to develop a personalized cancer vaccine, for which new clinical data will drop later this year. Bancel said the product could go up for approval in roughly two years if all goes well.\n\nThe company is also exploring a potential monkeypox jab, which is “still in the lab today,” Bancel said. The World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of the illness a public health emergency of international concern last month.\n\nAnd Moderna is looking to catch up to competitors overseas.\n\nEarlier this year, it announced a push into 10 Asian and European markets, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark and the Netherlands. The investments will cost “dozens of millions of dollars” and include hundreds of new hires, said Bancel.\n\nMembers of the public waiting in line at a vaccination facility administering the Moderna Covid-19 shot in Taipei, Taiwan in April.

Its stock rallied 434% in 2020 and 143% last year.\n\nBut now, like peers Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX), the firm’s stock has slumped, dropping more than 30% so far this year and 64% from its all-time high a year ago.\n\nLast week, the company revealed that it took a writedown of nearly $500 million in the second quarter, partly because of a sudden cancellation of orders from Covax, the international vaccination program for lower-income countries.\n\nThe reversal led to huge losses for the company, which had bought new machines to fulfill those orders, and more importantly, resulted in Covid vaccines being thrown in the trash, said Bancel.\n\n“We ended up destroying the vaccines,” he said. “It was really heartbreaking.”\n\nThe CEO said he wasn’t worried about that kind of slide in demand being repeated in richer countries, in part because governments had already shown commitments to use vaccines later this year to avoid reintroducing economic lockdowns.\n\nBut “on the low-income country side, yes, I am worried,” he said.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/tech/iphone-14-pro-camera-shake/index.html", "title": "Apple plans fix for bug that users say makes iPhone 14 Pro camera ...", "text": "1.

The pain likely isn’t over for investors.\n\nWhat’s happening: JPMorgan analysts are now predicting another 25% drop for bitcoin in the coming weeks.\n\nThat’s in part due to the continued fallout from FTX as well as a different challenge that has been hitting crypto already: In addition to hiking interest rates, the Federal Reserve has been shrinking its balance sheet since June, removing money from financial markets to cool the economy in its fight against inflation. Those efforts mean capital is drying up – and that’s not just bad for crypto but other asset classes including stocks, too.\n\nThe big picture: It’s been a very rough time for crypto investors: The value of Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has fallen by more than 75% to $15,984 since this time a year ago.\n\nCryptocurrencies enjoyed huge injections of money during the pandemic era thanks to the Federal Reserve’s easy money policy. The central bank kept interest rates near zero and infused the balance sheets of big banks with cash by purchasing vast sums of bonds and other assets.\n\nThat’s no longer the case. In recent months inflation has soared, interest rates have been lifted, and that cash has dried up. That’s bad news for digital assets, which are considered by Wall Street analysts to be sponges for that excess money.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say that the Fed’s policies will create a large drag on the availability of cash for investment well into next year. “In all, the slowdown in global money growth looks set to continue over the coming year, with some contraction looking likely in the US,” wrote JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a note.\n\nLess money means more risk-aversion and investors are stopping out of crypto. Now other digital asset platforms like Solana are also facing a cash crunch.\n\nThe spread: Other risk-sensitive sectors like Big Tech are facing similar problems.\n\nDeclines in the information technology sector, which includes companies like Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, accounted for 44% of the decline of the entire S&P 500 this year through October.\n\nThe reaction makes total sense, said David Holt, an analyst with investment research firm CFRA. The Federal Reserve essentially “dropped money into the economy from a helicopter for a decade and then quickly took away the punchbowl,” he said. “That’s caused high-risk and high-growth sectors like crypto to unravel. That mentality shift has also created an overhang in other pockets of the economy like technology.”\n\nAnother victim: The US housing market has also been hurt by the shift in Fed policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was one of the biggest buyers of home loan debt during the pandemic. As a result, those mortgage-backed securities began to sell-off, and mortgage rates rose significantly. They now sit above 7%, up four percentage points from a year ago and buyers’ purchasing power has plummeted. Sales have dropped for eight months running, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nChina’s Covid bounceback\n\nMarkets applauded a move by China to ease its Covid restrictions last week. The yuan rose to its strongest level in more than a month, and travel stocks listed in Hong Kong jumped on the news.\n\nAnd Chinese authorities are trying to end a crisis in the country’s vast real estate sector that has weighed heavily on the economy over the past year. In what could be a key turning point, Beijing on Friday unveiled a 16-point plan that reverses a crackdown on lending to the sector. Shares of China’s biggest developer soared as much as 52% in Hong Kong on Monday.\n\nBut investors still may want to proceed with caution.\n\nAs my colleague Laura He has reported, China has been beset by severe economic problems. Growth has stalled, youth unemployment is at a record high and the housing market had been collapsing.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently cut its forecast for China’s growth to 3.2% this year, representing a sharp slowdown from 8.1% in 2021. That would be the country’s second lowest growth rate in 46 years, better only than 2020 when the initial coronavirus outbreak pummeled the economy.\n\nBarclay’s has also cut its forecast for China’s economic growth next year based partly on expectations of a drop in global demand for Chinese goods and the deepening property market downturn. The sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China’s GDP, has been crippled by a government campaign since 2020 to rein in reckless borrowing and curb speculative trading. Property prices have been falling, as have sales of new homes.\n\nSingles day disappoints: Lackluster sales on the world’s biggest annual shopping event won’t help.\n\nChina’s Singles Day, the world’s biggest annual shopping event led by internet titans Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD), wrapped up on Friday.\n\nThis year, Alibaba did not disclose the final sales tally of the shopping festival for the first time since it began in 2009, saying instead that the results were in line with last year.\n\nLast year wasn’t impressive either. In 2021, sales for Singles Day rose 13%, “the smallest advance ever,” according to an analysis by Bain & Company.\n\nAmericans are feeling bad about the economy\n\nConsumers were feeling worse about the US economy in November, according to a closely followed University of Michigan survey released Friday.\n\nThe negative outlook comes amid punishing rate hikes and decades-high inflation, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace.\n\nThe preliminary index reading from the monthly Surveys of Consumers showed sentiment fell to 54.7, from 59.9 in October. Economists were expecting sentiment levels to tick down to 59.5, according to estimates on Refinitiv.\n\nIt’s the lowest reading since this summer when sentiment bottomed out after gas prices hit a record high in June.\n\nWhy it matters: The Fed is closely watching for shifts in consumer expectations to determine if inflation is becoming entrenched in the United States: If consumers believe prices will remain high, that could factor into increased wage demands which, in turn, could cause businesses to raise prices.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/health/rsv-hospitals-what-to-know-wellness/index.html", "title": "RSV is spreading at unusually high levels, overwhelming children's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Amber Sizemore and her family went out of state to celebrate her birthday last week, she had hoped her toddler daughter, Raegan, would try swimming. But the 15-month-old, normally energetic and adventurous, wasn’t herself on Saturday.\n\n“She hated it, and she normally loves water,” Sizemore said.\n\nBy Sunday, when the family was heading back to Ohio, the little girl was “coughing like crazy.”\n\n“She coughed so hard, she threw up,” Sizemore said. Raegan also stopped eating and developed a fever.\n\nWhen Tylenol didn’t help, Sizemore took her to urgent care and told them that RSV or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cold-like virus, was going around at Raegan’s day care, where Sizemore also works.\n\nThe test came back positive, and Raegan’s vital signs prompted the staffers at the urgent care to tell Sizemore to take her daughter to the hospital.\n\nAs soon as they saw her vitals, the staff at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland knew they had to admit Raegan, her mom said. She needed oxygen.\n\n“They’ve been great here and taken good care of her, but the scariest part is, had I not already known she was exposed to RSV, I may have just let her cough it out,” Sizemore said. “I’m glad I didn’t wait.”\n\nMost kids catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, and it’s usually mild. Symptoms may look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. They typically last a week or two, and clear up with rest and fluids.\n\nBut in some children, especially young infants, RSV can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\nNow, there’s an “unprecedented” rise in RSV cases among children in the US, some doctors tell CNN.\n\nThe CDC does not track hospitalizations or deaths for RSV like it does for flu, but it said Thursday there has been a rise in RSV cases in many parts of the country. Several children’s hospitals told CNN that they’ve been “overwhelmed” with patients at a time of the year when it’s unusual to have a surge of RSV patients.\n\nOverall, pediatric hospital beds are more full now than they’ve been in the past two years, according to federal data.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services does not specify the reason for hospitalization, but about three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds available nationwide are being used now. By comparison, pediatric hospital beds were about two-thirds full on an average day over the past two years.\n\n‘Never seen this level of surge’\n\nWith the RSV surge, UH Rainbow Babies has had so many patients, it went on diversion for a couple of days in early October, meaning it couldn’t take external emergency admissions. It’s taking patients again now, but it’s still slammed with RSV cases.\n\nThere has been such such a dramatic increase in cases in Connecticut that Connecticut Children’s Hospital has been coordinating with the governor and public health commissioner to determine whether it should bring the National Guard in to expand its capacity to care for these young patients.\n\n“I’ve been doing this a long time. I’ve been at Connecticut Children’s for 25 years, and I’ve never seen this level of surge specifically for RSV coming into our hospital,” Dr. Juan Salazar, the hospital’s executive vice president and physician in chief, told CNN.\n\nIn Texas, where RSV cases usually spike in December or January, the emergency department at Cook Children’s in Fort Worth and its urgent cares are seeing a significant number of RSV cases. Nearly half the ICU is filled with RSV cases, hospital spokesperson Kim Brown said; between October 2 and 8, there were 210 RSV cases at Cook Children’s; a week later, there were 288.\n\nJeff and Zoey Green’s 4-month-old, Lindy, was admitted to Cook on Sunday.\n\nAt the hospital, Lindy’s fever was so high at one point they said they used ice packs to cool her down.\n\n“I don’t know how but she slept with those ice packs on top of her,” Zoey Green said, holding an exhausted Lindy at the hospital. She said they’re trying to keep her hydrated so she doesn’t have to go back on an IV.\n\n“We want her to be better, for sure.”\n\nDr. Mallory Davis, an infection preventionist at Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is also seeing an early surge.\n\n“We are very full, and our census numbers are pretty high as we work through kind of figuring out how to accommodate all of the sick kiddos in the community,” she said.\n\nChildren’s Hospital Colorado has seen an early uptick in RSV hospitalizations and is starting to see the first few flu cases of the season, said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n“We have been seeing increased patient volumes since the late summer, which started with rhinoviruses and enteroviruses as children returned to school, and now is being driven by RSV and parainfluenza,” he said. “With influenza season rapidly approaching with what appears to be an early start, we are concerned about the persistently increased volumes of sick children requiring hospitalization.”\n\nAt UH Rainbow Babies, staff are hoping things don’t get much worse. “I mean, I hope we’re peaking right now, because if we’re not, then holy hell,” said Dr. Amy Edwards, associate medical director for pediatric infection control.\n\nRSV cases can often fill hospitals, even in regular seasons, since there aren’t many treatments and it can require several days of supportive care in severe cases, Edwards said.\n\nIll children “need that oxygen support, so they can’t be at home,” she said.\n\nExperts think US cases may be spiking now because of the phase of the Covid-19 pandemic that we’re in.\n\nWhen everyone stayed home in 2020 and 2021 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it seemed to change the typical RSV season. Case counts were low, and that created an “immunity gap.”\n\nKids who normally would have caught the virus in those years are instead catching it now.\n\nWho’s vulnerable to RSV\n\nThe CDC says most kids will catch RSV at some point before they turn 2. It’s a highly contagious virus that often doesn’t cause serious illness, except in adults who are elderly or have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, and in some infants and children.\n\nThere’s no specific treatment for RSV and no vaccine. The symptoms usually last a week or two and clear up with plenty of fluids and rest.\n\nFor some kids, though, it can be a much more serious disease. RSV can be especially dangerous for preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\nRSV can turn into bronchiolitis, in which the small airways can become inflamed and congested, or pneumonia. A child may need to stay in the hospital so they can get extra oxygen or even mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.\n\nHow RSV spreads\n\nAn infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.\n\nRSV symptoms RSV is a common virus, but it can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants and older adults. Symptoms may appear in stages and not all at once, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSymptoms include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing and sneezing Fever Wheezing “In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties,” according to the CDC.\n\nIt’s generally such a mild illness that adults often don’t realize they have it, or they think it’s nothing more than a cold or allergies and go on to interact with others.\n\n“It’s not a fatiguing virus the way influenza or Covid is, so you really do feel fine,” Edwards said. “And then what happens is, your neighbor has that beautiful baby, and you bring over a casserole, and you kiss that little baby because you feel fine. You don’t feel sick. And unfortunately, you pass it on to them, and sometimes they end up at the hospital.”\n\nOlder siblings can also pass the virus along to younger ones.\n\n“Babies slobber on toys and on each other and everything else, so day cares pass it along, too,” Edwards said.\n\nIf your child is coughing or lethargic, or if they just don’t seem like themselves, it’s a good idea to take them to their pediatrician. The doctor’s office will have the tests to figure out if it’s RSV, the flu, Covid-19 or strep.\n\nPediatricians say a trip to the ER may be necessary if a baby is dehydrated; if they have difficult, labored, shallow or rapid breathing; if they have a high fever or bluish skin; or if they become unresponsive. The CDC says most improve with supportive care and can often go home after a few days.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\n“Hand hygiene is the single most important thing that we can do to keep ourselves and others safe,” said Davis, of the children’s hospital in Grand Rapids. She tells people to never touch their faces unless they recently washed their hands.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen kids or grownups are sick, they need to do one thing and one thing only, she said: “Stay home when you are sick so you won’t spread whatever respiratory illness you have.”\n\nSizemore, whose daughter is still in the hospital with RSV but seems to be getting better, also advises people to take the virus seriously.\n\n“I would like other parents to know they shouldn’t watch their child’s cough lightly and take symptoms seriously,” she said. “This could have been a much worse situation if we didn’t get Raegan help.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Raenu Charles", "Jen Christensen", "Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/omicron-ba-5-variant-immunity-severity/index.html", "title": "Why the Omicron offshoot BA.5 is a big deal | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nOnce again, Covid-19 seems to be everywhere. If you feel caught off-guard, you aren’t alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again – and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who’ve been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who’ve had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n“We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. “But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.”\n\nA ‘full-on’ wave\n\nThe result is that we’re getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts – currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day – reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n“We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what’s being reported now.\n\n“We’re looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,” Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. “This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we’re experiencing this summer. It’s actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That’s the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n“That is unacceptable. It’s too high,” Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday’s briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n“I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency’s decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is “nowhere near over.”\n\nWhat’s at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who’d been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat’s another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It’s doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n“We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,” Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It’s been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere’s little information to go on: It’s still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness. But experts say it has all the hallmarks of a variant that could go global.\n\n“It spread to many different countries already, so we know that it has some sort of staying power,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease for Helix Labs, which decodes virus samples for the CDC and other clients.\n\nBecause of that, and because of changes in the region of the virus that our antibodies look for to shut it down, “we sort of know ahead of time that this one will cause some trouble,” Luo said.\n\nBased on what we know now, she expects that this subvariant could drive a fall Covid-19 wave in the United States.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the meantime, Jha said, people should get boosters that are available to them to keep their immunity as strong as possible.

The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 2.8 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths from influenza as of November 5.\n\nThe flu is notoriously hard to predict.\n\n“Among the people who study flu, there’s a little saying: ‘If you’ve seen one flu season, well, you’ve seen one flu season,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The implication is that they’re all a little bit different from each other, and that’s certainly the case.”\n\nThis season, there have been about 5 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people, rates typically seen in December or January, CDC data shows. And in the most recent week, about 13% of lab tests – more than 1 in 8 – were positive for influenza, up from 9% the week before.\n\nAlthough the numbers are especially high for this time of year, experts say the trends are otherwise following an expected pattern, and the early arrival of flu season doesn’t necessarily mean it will last longer or be more severe.\n\n“The picture is pretty consistent across our different pieces of surveillance. There’s nothing there that makes me think that this virus is really different and causing more severe disease than we see typically with flu,” said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist who leads the CDC’s domestic influenza surveillance team. “Flu can cause severe outcomes, but it’s not out of proportion this year compared to previous years. It’s not like we’re seeing a lot of hospitalizations without a lot of illness.”\n\nFlu activity has been highest in the South, CDC data shows. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments such as Tamiflu suggests hotspots centered in Mississippi and Alabama, spreading from the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans, up to Nashville.\n\nAs flu smolders in the South, RSV is showing early signs of slowing in the region, CDC data shows, even as it continues to ramp up in other parts of the country.\n\nNationwide, nearly 1 in 5 PCR tests for RSV were positive in the first week of November, reaching levels that the South saw a month ago. But in that region, fewer than 1 in 7 tests are now positive for RSV.\n\nRSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause serious illness, especially in younger infants, and it’s kept pediatric hospitals more full than usual in recent weeks.\n\nDespite the improvements in the South, overall burden on pediatric hospitals nationwide has not eased. More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds have been in use for the past few weeks – up from an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years, according to federal data.\n\nOn Thursday, Dr. Brian Cummings, medical director of the Department of Pediatrics at Mass General for Children, said they’ve seen around 2,000 cases of RSV in October, and more than 1,000 in the first week of November.\n\n“It’s been escalating and been quite severe,” Cummings said during a news conference Thursday.\n\nMost infections have been treated in urgent care facilities and in the emergency department, and people are sent home, Cummings said. “But even if just 10 percent of those need hospitalization, it creates a lot of stress on health care facilities, and so what we are seeing is we’ve had over 250 hospitalizations for RSV alone on top of the other circulating viruses,” he said.\n\nThe pediatric ICU is full, Cummings said, and seven patients are waiting to be transferred in.\n\nAcross the country, the threat of Covid-19, while significantly less than it was a year ago, remains.\n\nNearly 25,000 people were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 in the first week of November, according to CDC data, a pace that’s forecast to hold steady for the next month, at least.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs multiple respiratory viruses continue to spread, experts emphasize the importance of vaccination, which is available for two of the three viruses in heavy circulation. But those numbers are lower than ideal.\n\nOne in 5 people still hasn’t gotten their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, CDC data shows, and less than 10% of the US population has gotten the updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nAnd millions fewer flu vaccines have been distributed this season than at this point in previous years.\n\n“You worry when you have an early season that people just haven’t had time to get vaccinated,” Brammer said. “But vaccine is the best tool that we have to prevent these severe outcomes.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/variants-covid-winter-surge/index.html", "title": "Quick and stealthy new Covid-19 variants are poised to drive a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge.\n\nIn the United States, these are BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2. In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore. Cases are also rising in Europe and the UK, where these variants have taken hold.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, says he thinks of them collectively as the Scrabble variants because they use letters that get high scores in the board game like Q, X and B.\n\nAs the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants.\n\nLumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe updated bivalent booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants.\n\nBut the new variants are particularly devastating for millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems. New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/21/covid-omicron-not-march-2020/8967351002/", "title": "Omicron has overtaken delta in the US.

Back then, only a handful of people on Earth had been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Everyone's immune system was unprepared.\n\nToday, the majority of Americans have either contracted COVID-19 or been vaccinated once, twice or three times against it. That should – though there are no hard numbers to confirm it – provide people protection against severe disease and death.\n\n\"I think we should reassure people that if they've been vaccinated with two doses or naturally infected, they're likely protected against serious illness,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease expert and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nWhat's not clear is how people who have never been vaccinated or contracted COVID-19, or whose protection has waned, will fare if they catch omicron.\n\nAn experiment in hamsters, which should see results as soon as Tuesday, will provide the first indication of how people far from an infection or vaccination may fare if they are infected, said Galit Alter, an immunologist and virologist at Harvard Medical School and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard.\n\nMore vaccinated or previously infected people are contracting omicron than they did earlier variants, data shows. Vaccinated people, and perhaps those who've already been infected, are probably less likely to pass the virus to others.\n\nIt's still the unvaccinated and unprotected who are providing opportunity for the pandemic to continue, Offit said.\n\n\"You have a critical percentage of the population who are unvaccinated and shedding this virus,\" he said.\n\nSouth Africa's experience\n\nData out of South Africa, where omicron hit early and which has tracked cases carefully, is incomplete but encouraging.\n\nThere, hospitalization rates are much lower than in previous waves of infection, and the people hospitalized are not as sick as those infected with the beta or delta variants, said Salim Abdool Karim, a South African epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist and member of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.\n\nOnly 2% to 4% of infected people are ending up in hospitals, compared with about 20% during the beta and delta waves, Karim said. Before, two-thirds of those hospitalized had severe cases; now about one-quarter meet that criteria. Death rates are one-tenth as high as they were with previous variants.\n\n\"The clinical picture we are seeing is one of substantially less severe disease,\" he said.\n\nKarim said he doesn't have information on how many hospitalized patients had been previously infected or vaccinated, though he expects to get that soon.\n\nAnecdotally, Karim said, \"there's a preponderance of unvaccinated\" in hospitals, probably about 75% of patients. \"Is it more severe in that group? What's the picture? I can't tell at this point because I don't have that data.\"\n\nThe department of public health in South Africa decided people exposed to an infected person but not infected themselves do not have to quarantine.\n\nKarim said he recommended his government reinstitute mandates to minimize crowds. Officials didn't take his advice. But the general public has followed with their feet.\n\n\"Theaters are empty. Restaurants are half-empty with just a handful of people,\" he said. \"People have come to that conclusion themselves. … Indoor gatherings? No. No.\"\n\nOmicron is more contagious than other variants, he said: There were 35,000 to 45,000 cases in South Africa in the first month of the beta and delta waves and 133,000 cases in the first month of omicron.\n\nDenmark has seen similarly high rates of transmissibility and low rates of serious disease.\n\nUnlike other variants, which slowly made their way from country to country, omicron is exploding around the world simultaneously, said Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\n\"In prior waves, we had a few weeks to watch what was happening in Western Europe and other places to know what we were in store for,\" he said. Not this time. \"We're not going to have the luxury of watching what's going to unfold in our country elsewhere in advance.\"\n\nThe US outbreak\n\nAlthough it's still early days in the American experience with omicron, the variant has overtaken delta in the USA. As of Saturday, the omicron variant accounted for 73.2 % of new COVID-19 infections in the nation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported, up from 12.6% the previous week.\n\n\"It's clear we're now waist-deep in the omicron wave,\" Lemieux said. \"The question is how severe is it going to be?\"\n\nIt may follow South Africa's pattern that the majority of people get nothing worse than a bad head cold. Or it may cause more hospitalizations, particularly among those who have waning or no protection, potentially overwhelming the health care system, which was already dealing with a wave of delta infections, he said.\n\nAt Texas Children’s Hospital, doctors are waiting to confirm how many cases are omicron versus delta, but pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization rates have more than doubled in four days, and the number of patients is in the double-digits.\n\nThe rate of positive tests jumped from well below 5% five days ago to 15% Monday, according to James Versalovic, co-chair of the Texas Children’s Hospital COVID-19 Command and the hospital’s pathologist-in-chief.\n\n“These are signals that tell us we have a surge beginning,” Versalovic said. “Every indication now is pointing in the same direction.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether children will react differently to omicron than they did to delta. Nor does the hospital know the vaccination status of the children over 5 (vaccinations are not authorized for those younger than 5), their parents’ vaccination status or whether any of the children was previously infected with COVID-19, he said.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said he hears anecdotal descriptions that omicron infections differ from delta. People don't appear to be losing their smell or taste the way they did with earlier variants.\n\nIf true, that would be extremely good news, Topol said, because it would mean this variant isn't entering the brain and would take off the table the risk of neurological problems.\n\nOmicron appears not to get into the lung cells, according to studies from Hong Kong and the U.K. \"That was the most distinguishing feature (of COVID-19) until now,\" Topol said, and the reason it caused so much lung damage. \"I know of a few people who had really high fevers (with omicron),\" he said. \"No one's had pneumonia.\"\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhat will happen with the virus remains uncertain.\n\n\"The virology community is kind of split 50-50 on whether this creature has big surprises in store for us or whether we've seen most of what it can do,\" Dr. Jeremy Luban, another member of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, said Monday.\n\nHe and others were surprised to see how many differences omicron has from its predecessor variants – without any obvious intermediate changes. \"The virus may be doing things that are not under our magnifying glass and we can't actually see,\" he said.\n\nIt may have given up some of its ability to cause harm when it became more transmissible, Luban said.\n\nEventually, a variant will become so dominant that no other will be able to outcompete it and the pace of change will slow down, Karim said. Some experts thought delta had reached that point. He expects there are several variants left to come.\n\nUntil then, and to combat the lingering uncertainties of omicron, everyone should get vaccinated and boosted, wear masks, open windows and avoid crowds, he and others said.\n\n\"We've learned the same lesson again and again,\" Luban said. \"The virus is transmitted in enclosed spaces with lots of people congregating. And masks work.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Among those, 24 cases and six deaths were in men who have sex with men.\n\nThe CDC says the outbreak is “primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, including those living with HIV. Recent data show that about half of the cases associated with this outbreak are among Hispanic men. This outbreak is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida.”\n\nMeningococcal disease includes meningitis – infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord – and bloodstream infections. “Meningococcal disease can affect anyone and can be deadly,” the CDC said in its statement.\n\nThe bacteria is spread through sharing respiratory or throat secretions, such as saliva or spit. It normally takes close or lengthy contact, for example kissing or being close to someone who is coughing, to spread the bacteria.\n\nSymptoms include high fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea or vomiting or a dark purple rash, the CDC said.

For those who live with HIV, health officials are emphasizing the importance of routine vaccination.\n\n“Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease is the best way to prevent this serious illness, which can quickly become deadly,” said Dr. José R. Romero, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in the CDC news release. “Because of the outbreak in Florida, and the number of Pride events being held across the state in coming weeks, it’s important that gay and bisexual men who live in Florida get vaccinated, and those traveling to Florida talk to their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine.”\n\nThe vaccine is offered at doctors’ offices, pharmacies, community health centers or local health departments, the CDC said, and insurance should cover the cost for people for whom the vaccine is recommended during an outbreak. Anyone in Florida can get the vaccine at no cost at county health departments during the outbreak.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the outbreak affecting men who have sex with men is caused by serogroup C.

Flu activity in the United States often starts to increase in October and usually peaks between December and February.\n\n“We can confirm that there is a high number of absences at Henry High School due to probable Influenza,” Samer Naji, a spokesperson for the San Diego Unified School District, said in an email to CNN on Thursday. There were about 1,000 absences Wednesday, out of 2,600 students.\n\n“So far COVID tests have been negative but several students have tested positive for flu,” Naji said. “Typical signs and symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever, and other upper respiratory infection symptoms. We are in close contact with San Diego County Public Health.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services confirmed to CNN that it is investigating the large outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms among students at Patrick Henry High School – as well as Del Norte High School in Poway, California.\n\n“Del Norte High School (in the Poway Unified School District) had nearly 400 students absent yesterday and Tuesday with cold and flu like symptoms,” Christine Paik, spokesperson at Poway Unified School District, told CNN on Wednesday. “Health officials have told us that the cold/flu season is definitely here and it’s hitting schools harder now that COVID restrictions are no longer in place.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services announced Wednesday that “it is too early” to determine the cause of the outbreaks and that the county is evaluating.\n\n“We are coordinating with local school districts and are checking with other school campuses to try and figure out why so many students have been affected so suddenly,” Dr. Cameron Kaiser, the county’s deputy public health officer, said in an announcement Wednesday.\n\n“Unfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19 other respiratory viruses are also making a rapid comeback,” Kaiser said. “If you haven’t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines.”\n\nEarly increases in flu activity sweep the US\n\nAn early increase in seasonal flu activity has been reported in most of the United States, with the nation’s southeast and south-central areas reporting the highest levels of flu, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than a thousand patients have been hospitalized with flu this week, the agency said.\n\n“Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is increasing; however, activity varies by region,” CDC researchers wrote in the agency’s latest weekly flu report, published Friday.\n\nWhile current influenza activity is still overall low, the CDC’s report finds that activity is increasing in most of the country, with three jurisdictions experiencing moderate activity and six jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity.\n\nThis week, 3.3% of respiratory specimens sent to clinical labs tested positive for influenza, according to the new report. That is a jump from the 0.1% of specimens that tested positive this time last year, and the 0.2% of specimens that tested positive this time in 2020.\n\nHowever, the new data suggest the nation might be returning to pre-Covid levels of flu, as around this time in 2019, 3.1% of specimens were reported as testing positive for flu.\n\nThe new CDC report also said that 1,322 patients were admitted to hospitals with influenza this week and there were three deaths in children this week associated with influenza.\n\nOverall, the most frequently reported flu viruses this week were influenza A (H3N2), according to the report, and 2.6% of outpatient visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses that included symptoms such as fever plus a cough or sore throat. That is above the national baseline, which is 2.5%.\n\n“An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against flu. Vaccination helps prevent infection and can also prevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but still get sick with flu,” according to the report.\n\n“CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness; those need to be started as early as possible.”\n\n‘It’s gathering speed already … about a month early’\n\nPredicting what influenza activity might look like in a particular year can be tricky, but doctors are bracing for “a very substantial” flu season, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\n“I’m concerned that we will have a very substantial influenza season coming up this year, very different from our two previous seasons,” he said.\n\nSigns of increased flu activity were first seen in the Southern Hemisphere this summer, and as more people in the Northern Hemisphere relax Covid-19 restrictions and return to socializing without masks and in large crowds, cases of flu are being reported. The widespread number of cases so early in the flu season is unusual.\n\n“Here we are in the middle of October – not the middle of November – we’re already seeing scattered influenza cases, even hospitalized influenza cases, around the country,” Schaffner, whose medical center at Vanderbilt University is part of a surveillance network that tracks hospitalized flu cases.\n\n“So we know that this virus is now spreading out in the community already. It’s gathering speed already. It looks to me to be about a month early,” Schaffner said.\n\nWhen people began isolating, social distancing and masking to slow the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020, flu all but disappeared in the US. As a result, most people haven’t been exposed to influenza for a few years, meaning immunity against flu viruses could be low and underscoring the need to get vaccinated.\n\nUS health officials are encouraging people to get their flu shots as soon as possible, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“There’s definitely a push now to get flu vaccination to the top of people’s priority lists. We’re all concerned, having seen what’s going on in the Southern Hemisphere, in Australia, that this year’s flu season could be really, really rough, frankly,” Casalotti said.\n\nConcern has grown as officials also brace for possible surges this winter in Covid-19 and other common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children.\n\nCasalotti said that the spread of influenza can have a significant effects on communities, especially since it can be hard to distinguish flu symptoms from those of Covid-19, common colds or allergies.\n\n“We’re already starting to see in some areas that flu is circulating,” Casalotti said. “Overall, flu activity is low nationwide, but it’s starting to tick up in the Southeast in particular.”\n\nA higher-dose flu shot for older adults\n\nIn August, as concern about the coming flu season grew, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices released a report updating its recommendations for the seasonal flu shot for this year.\n\nTypically, older adults get a higher dose of flu vaccine than younger adults, but in the latest update, ACIP recommended that adults 65 and older “preferentially receive” a higher dose or an adjuvanted flu vaccine.\n\n“There are three of the influenza vaccines that have been shown to work better in people aged 65 and older,” said Schaffner, who is a liaison representative to ACIP. “There is the high-dose vaccine, there’s another that has an adjuvant in it – an immune stimulant – and the third is a recombinant vaccine.” Recombinant flu vaccines do not involve the flu virus or chicken eggs in the manufacturing process.\n\n“If you look back at people aged 65 and older in previous seasons, already 80% of them were receiving one of these three vaccines,” he said. “What’s new this year is that the ACIP has made a distinctively preferential recommendation. They actually said if you’re vaccinating people aged 65 and older, preferentially use one of these three vaccines, and only if one of them is not available use the regular vaccine.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, especially people who could be pregnant – as the vaccine offers protection not only to them but to their baby, Schaffner said.\n\n“There’s an additional benefit,” he said. “Namely, the antibodies created in response to the vaccine, some of it crosses the placenta and goes into the newborn baby. So the newborn baby gets some of that protection during the first four to six months of its life, before we can actively vaccinate the baby.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/11/20/new-covid-omicron-variants-winter/10718706002/", "title": "New COVID variants BQ.1, BQ.1.1 dominate; what're omicron's ...", "text": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is bringing more variants our way, requiring a few changes to the fight against it.\n\nThe BA.5 variant of omicron, which has dominated the U.S. since early summer, is fading fast. According to data released Friday, half the cases in the U.S. are now due to two descendants of BA.5, called BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nNot much is known about those two variants, but the severity and duration of disease seem similar to the other omicrons, and milder than the original and delta variants.\n\nThe biggest challenge from the new variants will be for people who are immunocompromised because of disease or medications. Treatments designed to prevent and treat infection in the immunocompromised won't work against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nGet weekly coronavirus updates in your inbox:Sign up for our newsletter now.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat is the current COVID variant and what happened to omicron?\n\nThe omicron variant that caused so many infections last winter is still around, but it has split into many subvariants. The two subvariants – BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 – now account for half of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 now accounts for 24% of cases.\n\nAre the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 more dangerous?\n\nLab studies suggest the viral descendants of BA.5 and BA.2, which includes all the new dominant variants, might cause slightly more severe disease than BA.1 or the original omicron, said Jeremy Luban, a professor of molecular medicine, biochemistry and molecular biotechnology at UMass Chan Medical School.\n\nBut it's not clear whether that's true in the real world, he said, as lab studies can't capture factors like human behavior.\n\nThe new variants are clearly more transmissible because they are taking over and making people sick despite previous vaccinations and infections, he said in a Thursday news conference with other members of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness.\n\nWill vaccines and the bivalent booster still work against omicron variants?\n\nYes.\n\n\"Any kind of boost really reduces your chances of getting very sick from COVID,\" said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, an infectious disease expert at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nPeople who got the bivalent booster will be more protected against a severe COVID-19 infection compared with those who are unvaccinated or got a vaccine long ago.\n\nIn a study posted Friday, Pfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech say that the latest booster increases the level of neutralizing antibodies against both BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, which protect against infection.\n\nModerna reported similar results for its booster earlier in the week, and it said last week that its bivalent shot also showed “robust neutralizing activity” against the BQ.1.1 variant, suggesting it offers some protection against the newest strains.\n\nRead more about vaccines:\n\nWhat does BQ stand for?\n\nThe World Health Organization uses the Greek alphabet as a classification system to simplify understanding and avoid stigmatizing countries where strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 are identified.\n\nThe WHO named the original B.1.1.529 variant after the 15th letter, omicron. Within variants, the agency assigns numbers to sublineages.\n\nBA.5 was classified as an omicron variant but has mutations that distinguish it from other omicron subvariants, such as BA.1 and BA.2. BA.5 is the parental strain of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the new omicron variants?\n\nThe symptoms of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 appear to be the same as for other COVID-19 variants. The most common symptoms include exhaustion, fever, a cough, congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle aches or headache. Loss of smell, which originally characterized COVID-19 infections, is no longer as common.\n\nBefore you get sick:Have these essentials at home to ease cold, flu and COVID symptoms\n\nCan I get BQ.1 or BQ.1.1 if I've had BA.5?\n\nYes. Theoretically anyone is vulnerable if exposed to enough viral particles. But people who have been boosted or infected within the last three to six months are less likely to be infected again and certainly less likely to suffer severe disease, Stephenson said.\n\nWhat to do if I get infected by BQ.1 or BQ.1.1?\n\nIf you test positive for the coronavirus or feel sick with related symptoms, the CDC recommends:\n\nStay home for at least five days and isolate from other household members\n\nWear a well-fitted mask around others in the home\n\nIf you're fever-free for 24 hours and symptoms improve after the five days, the CDC says you can end isolation, but take precautions for five additional days. This includes wearing masks and avoiding travel.\n\nWhat if I have a compromised immune system?\n\nThis is a \"pretty scary\" time for people who don't have good working immune systems, either because of older age, diseases like cancer, or treatments that reduce immunity, Luban said.\n\nThe last two protective monoclonal antibodies don't work against the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 variants, said Jake Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThat includes Evusheld, which was used to prevent severely immunocompromised people from getting very sick with COVID-19. It's a big loss, he said: \"I do hope there will be a replacement drug for prophylaxis that retains activity against circulating variants.\"\n\nFlu, RSV and COVID: What to know about the 'tripledemic'\n\nDoctors are saying we're currently in a \"tripledemic\" with three respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, flu and RSV circulating simultaneously.\n\nVaccinating against both flu and COVID-19 will help limit severe infections, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nThere are currently no vaccines or specific treatment for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which can infect people repeatedly and are particularly dangerous for the very young and very old, he said.\n\nIt's not clear why, but both flu and RSV are circulating much earlier this year than they did before the pandemic, said Dr. Tina Tan, vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which held a news conference Friday that included her and Schaffner.\n\n\"Whether or not these will go back to normal (in future years), nobody knows,\" she said.\n\nTan, a pediatrician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, said she knows everyone is ready for a \"new normal,\" but she worries that not enough people are getting COVID-19 boosters and annual flu shots, and that children and adults have fallen behind on other routine vaccinations as well.\n\n\"Vaccines need to be part of that new normal to prevent individuals from becoming ill with the viruses and bacteria that are circulating,\" she said. \"That is the new normal.\"\n\nRead more about this topic:\n\nCan we have a COVID-free Thanksgiving? Here are some tips.\n\nExtreme precautions are no longer needed, experts say. But Lemieux said people should be careful if they have very young, very old or immunocompromised people at their holiday gatherings.\n\nHe suggests guests use a home COVID-19 test before sitting down together in an enclosed space and that people who are sick shouldn't go at all.\n\n\"I don't want to say 'cancel Thanksgiving,' but I also don't want to say 'don't worry about respiratory viruses,'\" said Lemieux, who also worries about the flu and RSV getting passed around along with the turkey.\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n►If you develop cold symptoms, get tested for COVID-19: Take a test right away because the antiviral Paxlovid, which can help prevent severe disease in high-risk people, works only if given within five days of infection.\n\n►If you're traveling, wear a mask: Masking while traveling to celebrations also makes sense, said Dr. Lael Yonker, a pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital. She's had her children wear masks leading up to the holiday.\n\n►Get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19: For Schaffner's family gathering, everyone must be vaccinated against flu and boosted against COVID-19, he said. \"No one wants to be a dreaded spreader,\" he said.\n\nWhen can we stop worrying about new variants?\n\nExperts have been waiting for the virus that causes COVID-19 to settle into a seasonal pattern and stop mutating so much, but it hasn't happened yet. While current vaccines are considered safe and very effective against severe disease, they do not prevent all infections.\n\nNext-generation vaccines, currently under development, could provide broader or longer-term protection against COVID-19. Companies are also exploring delivering the vaccine through the nose rather than by shots, which might provide more protection against infection.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech announced Wednesday that they have started a 180-person early-stage trial of a new candidate vaccine they hope will broaden and extend protection against the virus. The new vaccine will target the \"spike\" protein on the surface of the original virus plus the version of spike on the BA.5 variant, as well as a nonspike protein that doesn't seem to be mutating as much.\n\nThe trial will include three different doses and variations to see if the candidate vaccine is better than the current one.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/mexico-border-encounter-data-analysis-cec/index.html", "title": "A 'radical shift' at the border is making things tougher for Biden | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a major detail missing from many conversations about the rising number of migrants coming to the US-Mexico border.\n\nDecades ago, the vast majority of migrants attempting to cross the border between ports of entry were Mexican. A few years ago, most came from the Central American countries known as the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nBut now, according to Border Patrol statistics, the number of people coming from outside those places – from countries such as Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela – is growing fast.\n\nDavid Bier calls it a “radical shift” and a “new phenomenon that no one is talking about.” Bier, the associate director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, pointed out this change in a recent thread on Twitter. It’s a telling detail, he says, that reveals a lot about what the Biden administration is facing at the border, and why the situation has been so difficult to solve.\n\nTo better understand this trend, CNN dove into the data. Here’s a look at what we’re seeing, why this change is so significant, why it’s happening, what this looks like on the ground and what could happen next.\n\nWhat we’re seeing: There’s a big change in who’s coming to the US-Mexico border. A large number of migrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle are still making the journey. But the number of migrants from other countries, represented here in purple, has significantly increased.\n\nBack in 2007, the number of migrants in this “other” category was negligible. But since then, it’s grown dramatically — 11,000% — with the sharpest increase in just the past two years.\n\nUS Border Patrol encounters still show more migrants from Mexico attempting to cross the Southwest border in July than from any other individual country. But so far this fiscal year, for the first time, encounters with migrants from outside Mexico and the Northern Triangle are outpacing encounters with migrants from either of those regions.\n\nA handful of countries make up a large portion of this growing group at the border. The number of times US Border Patrol officials at the Southwest border encountered migrants from Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela has increased dramatically over the past two years.\n\nOne word of caution about the numbers: For this analysis, we used US Customs and Border Protection statistics on Border Patrol encounters – which include both migrants who are apprehended and detained, at least temporarily, at the border, and migrants who are immediately expelled to their home countries and Mexico. This data gives us the best overall picture of who is arriving and what’s happening at the border.\n\nBut officials have acknowledged the numbers can be inflated, because they include some migrants who were turned back under the “Title 42” public health policy, then tried to cross again. In other words, the same people can be counted multiple times.\n\nThis is an issue that mostly affects migrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle, who are more likely to be subjected to Title 42 restrictions than migrants from other countries.\n\nWhy this is significant: Doris Meissner, who directs US immigration policy work at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, says the rise in additional nationalities at the border “makes border enforcement all the more complicated.”\n\nFor decades, many border policies have been designed with Mexican migrants in mind, she says, but it’s much more difficult to deport people to other countries. There are limits to which nationalities can be turned back under Title 42, for example. And frosty diplomatic relations can affect deportations, too.\n\n“These populations … require different kinds of responses,” Meissner says. “We have not established an asylum system that is in any way up to the level of the challenge that this change brought about.”\n\nBier says the groundwork for the trend was laid during the Trump administration. But the situation President Joe Biden is facing at the border is different from anything previous administrations have encountered.\n\n“What he’s dealing with, in terms of trying to restrict entry to the country, is completely different than what any other president has had to deal with,” Bier says. “Those realities are not really reflected in just the overall numbers. Looking at the number of people crossing, it’s just not representative of the unique circumstances of having to handle flows from so many different countries and many countries outside of this continent.”\n\nAdministration officials argue they’re working hard to address the root causes of migration. And Biden has described it as a “hemispheric challenge.”\n\nBut Bier says officials aren’t doing enough.\n\n“The Biden administration can’t respond to this new reality with the same old playbook,” he said on Twitter. He told CNN that’s exactly what the administration seems to be doing. “It’s a lot of the same types of responses,” he says.\n\nWhy it’s happening: There’s no simple reason why this is occurring, Bier says.\n\n“There are as many answers,” he says, “as there are countries represented in that group.”\n\nCBP Commissioner Chris Magnus recently told CBS News it’s impossible to pinpoint all the factors driving migrants to make the journey, given how complicated situations are in their home countries. “It’s a very complex set of dynamics,” he said.\n\nMeissner, who served as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993-2000, says the pandemic has played a major role by intensifying economic pressures.\n\nOther factors are also at play. An increase in Cubans making their way to the US, Meissner says, can be partially attributed to a new air route between Cuba and Nicaragua. CNN’s Patrick Oppmann reported that after Nicaragua dropped its visa requirements for Cubans, people began posting online ads selling their homes with “everything inside” to pay for the expensive airfare.\n\nDeteriorating economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care are increasingly pushing Venezuelans to leave, and a growing Venezuelan community in the United States is also a draw, Meissner says.\n\nFor Colombians and Nicaraguans, economic instability – compounded by the pandemic — has been the main driver of migration, she says, but politics are also playing a role.\n\n“Rising repression under the Ortega regime, especially during the recent presidential election, has cemented the belief among many Nicaraguans that the country’s political turmoil will not be resolved in the short term,” Meissner says.\n\nAnd those who previously saw neighboring Costa Rica as a destination, she says, are more likely to look elsewhere due to decreasing job prospects there.\n\nRising inflation and unemployment in Colombia are fueling more migration, Meissner says. Social unrest after a wave of protests in 2021 and political divisions that intensified during the recent presidential election are also likely influencing migrants’ decisions, she says.\n\nWhat this looks like on the ground: This isn’t just something we can see with statistics. Both migrants and Border Patrol officials say they’re noticing the shift.\n\nMore Cubans than ever are leaving the island. See where they're going 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nYuma Border Patrol Sector Chief Chris Clem told CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez last month that the large number of nationalities crossing the border was straining his agents.\n\n“The countries we’re receiving now — those nationalities are flying in, arriving to the border, and they’re having to be processed and there’s just so many of them that it is posing a challenge to the workforce,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to CNN earlier this year, one Cuban migrant described a house in the Mexican desert where she’d waiting with others to cross the border.\n\nOne room was packed with Cubans, she said. And another was full of people from different countries.\n\n“There were Colombians, Bangladeshis, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians,” she said. “It felt like the whole world was in there.”\n\nWhat could happen next: Like everything connected with the border, there’s a lot of debate about what officials should do about this.\n\nBiden administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that the border is not open. But those who favor increasing immigration restrictions argue that administration policies have incentivized more people to try their luck at crossing the border illegally. Some – including more than 50% of Republicans, according to a recent NPR-Ipsos poll – say they believe it’s completely true that the “US is experiencing an invasion at the southern border.” And some Republican candidates are emphasizing this message as midterm elections loom, pledging they’ll do more if elected to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nBier and Meissner say the changing makeup of migrants at the border shows how badly the US immigration system needs an overhaul.\n\n“Many, if not most, of these people are not likely to be eligible for asylum, even though they’re fleeing very difficult conditions,” Meissner says. “We desperately need to have Congress address the immigration laws and make it possible for there to be other legal pathways to come to the US.”\n\nAnd countries across the Western Hemisphere need to work together and address migration as a shared responsibility, she says.\n\nSo far, there’s no sign this trend is slowing down. And Bier and Meissner say they don’t expect it will.\n\n“It’s entirely plausible to think that this could continue for many years,” Bier says, “because we don’t have the infrastructure to expel people as fast as they come in.”", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Visitors, homeless people and commuters clutching cups of iced coffee crammed the street. Nearby, pedestrians dodged yellow cabs, double-decker tour buses and electric bicycles.\n\n“Where did all these people come from?” Flores, a 27-year-old undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, remembered thinking last month upon seeing New York up close for the first time. “It was different from everything we saw on the way here.”\n\nIndeed, a wave of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers arriving in New York in recent months – fleeing economic insecurity and political upheaval in Central and South America – have seen much during their months-long journey across more than a half dozen countries. They have traversed a remote, lawless jungle and rugged mountains, at times passing the corpses of others who perished along the way. They described roadblocks manned by rogue police officials or members of criminal and paramilitary groups who extorted money from them.\n\nAsylum seekers arrived to New York City's Port Authority station by the busload last month. NYC Immigrant Affairs\n\nHungry and tired, they reached the southern border and crossed into the United States, in Texas and other states on the Mexican frontier. After processing and receiving dates for asylum hearings, they were released by immigration officials to local charities and, in some cases, offered free trips to New York.\n\nThousands have chosen the Texas-chartered buses to New York City and the nation’s capital – where they have no connections or know where to turn for help. Many, like Flores and her family, ended up in New York’s overburdened shelter system, embarking on yet another uncertain odyssey as the newest members of the ever burgeoning homeless population.\n\n“A social worker at a Texas shelter told us there were free buses to New York,” Flores said on the phone from a city-run shelter for families in the Bronx. “We got on the next one and here we are.”\n\nNYC makes new arrivals ‘our priority’\n\nBy the last week in August, Texas had bused nearly 9,000 migrants to New York City and Washington, DC, as Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has sought to highlight what he said is the Biden administration’s failure to secure the border.\n\nTexas reported on August 26 that more than 7,400 migrants had been transported by the state to DC since April, and more than 1,500 to New York City since August 5, providing what Abbott’s office termed “much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.”\n\nAbbott’s office did not immediately reply to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nOn Friday morning, three buses from Texas delivered another 110 migrants to New York, city officials said.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million busing migrants to Washington and New York as of August 9, according to figures from the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Abbott’s office has said migrants are transported out of state only with their written permission but it’s unclear whether they’re given other options.\n\nAbbott and others who favor increasing immigration restrictions argue that Biden administration policies have provided an incentive for more people to cross the border illegally. Some Republican candidates have pushed the narrative of a migrant invasion as midterm elections approach, pledging they’ll do more to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Abbott added Chicago to the list of cities where his administration is busing migrants.\n\n“President Biden’s inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans — and Americans — at risk and is overwhelming our communities,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nChicago received 75 Venezuelan migrants from Texas – who were dropped off at Union Station Wednesday night, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot. She called Abbott “a man without any morals, humanity or shame.”\n\n“This is not something that we budgeted for, but it’s something that we must do. So we will figure out the finances,” Lightfoot said Thursday, adding that more buses were expected.\n\nManuel Castro greets migrants exiting a bus from Texas at the Port Authority on August 30. Castro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew York City has processed about 8,800 migrants in its shelter system since April, with about 6,700 still in shelters, a city official told CNN Thursday. City officials had said the figure included more than 1,000 children. Many migrants come to New York on their own with the financial assistance of nonprofits.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Abbott’s actions are throwing the federal system for processing migrants “out of whack” and criticized the governor for not coordinating with federal authorities.\n\nGenerally, migrants are processed by authorities, released and allowed to move throughout the US while they await immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and make their way to other parts of the country.\n\nThe busing campaign has led to sparring between Abbott and New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat whose administration has accused the governor of using human beings as political pawns and whose city has been long considered a sanctuary for migrants. The mayor has asked the federal government for more resources, including housing assistance. The White House said it is in touch with Adams and committed to FEMA funding and other support.\n\n“These individuals and families arrive hungry, thirsty and some need medical attention,” Manuel Castro, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, told CNN Tuesday. “So that is our priority – to make sure that these people are being supported and in comfort because what they’ve been through is just so devastating.”\n\nCastro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. He has been greeting migrants at the much maligned Port Authority terminal, a notorious commuter gateway once called “a hall of unfathomable nightmares” by the website Failed Architecture.\n\nA quest to give them their ‘humanity back’\n\nWhile city officials say they were initially caught off guard with the almost daily, unannounced arrival of charters, they mobilized – with the help of nonprofits – to set up a sectioned-off receiving area at the terminal. The migrants receive medical attention and rapid Covid-19 tests, food, clothing, prepaid phones, toiletries, legal assistance and transportation to temporary shelter. Many arrive without money, with just the clothes on their backs.\n\n“We know the trauma these families are going through but this is extra what’s happening here,” said Jose Lopez, co-executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York.\n\nThe nonprofit has volunteers at the terminal, distributing phones and cash assistance at tables set up in the receiving area.\n\n“Many of these families from Venezuela have traveled months on their feet and across the Rio Grande to get here. That is a treacherous trip. And imagine doing that with a three-year-old,” Lopez said.\n\n“I have a two-year-old and a five-year-old at home and the first family I met had a three-year-old girl who just looked around and had no understanding of what was happening. I needed to step away from the table for a minute. Her family was asking for resources. I asked the little girl what she had picked up from the tables. She said, ‘I just have Mami and Papi.’ ”\n\nLast week, at 6:45 a.m. on Thursday, the first two buses of the day pulled up alongside the terminal, one block west of Times Square, the so-called “Crossroads of the World.” Castro and community activists greeted passengers outside the buses with handshakes and applause – a procession of children covered in blankets, mothers clutching toddlers, and young men carrying backpacks and wearing flip flops. One man needed a wheelchair to get inside. Another migrant was taken away in an ambulance.\n\n“Dozens of volunteers … show up early in the morning and try to give those asylum seekers their humanity back,” said Alexander Rapaport, a founder of Masbia, a Jewish nonprofit that provides meals for the new arrivals.\n\nMost migrants end up in the city’s overcrowded homeless shelter system, which housed more than 50,000 people as of Thursday night, according to the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, which monitors shelter census reports. Some wait hours to be reunited with relatives who live in the area. Others, looking confused and disappointed, tell volunteers they believed they were headed to another city or state. New York is using 17 hotels as emergency shelters, a city official told CNN.\n\nFor now, the migrants will have to rely on a vast, longstanding social safety net created by nonprofits and city agencies, easing access to government resources and benefits for housing, healthcare and food.\n\n‘We could not stay there’\n\nA bus carrying migrants who crossed the border from Mexico into Texas arrives at the Port Authority bus station in Manhattan on August 25. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nFlores and her family have been staying at a crowded family shelter in the Bronx, where, she said, the language barrier makes it difficult to communicate with staff and residents.\n\nWhen they arrived in Texas last month, she said, they were released without money and no place to go. A social worker at a church-run shelter offered them free bus tickets to New York.\n\nThe family left Maracaibo, on Venezuela’s northwest coast, on May 18.\n\n“We were going hungry,” she said. “We could not stay there. There is nothing. If you get sick, you die… There is no future there. The future is here.”\n\nFlores and other migrants described the days it took to cross the Darién Gap, the more than 60 miles of dense rain forest, steep mountains and swamps along the Colombia-Panama border. It is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.\n\n“We spent seven days in the jungle with another family,” Flores said. “A guide abandoned us but we were fortunate to make our way out.”\n\nBy the time Flores’ family reached the northern Mexican city of Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, she said they were exhausted, hungry and penniless – having paid hundreds of dollars at roadblocks from Guatemala to Mexico.\n\nLast Thursday, Venezuelan asylum seekers Manaure Fernandez, 25, and Wilber Salvatierra, 23, emerged from the bus terminal with plastic bags after stepping off a Greyhound bus from San Antonio. A charity had paid for the $270 bus fare, they said.\n\nMigrants wait in line last month outside the Port Authority after arriving from Texas. Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFernandez said he left Venezuela in late May. He was robbed of all his money in the Darién Gap – about $800 – by three masked armed with rifles. The men told the migrants said they were part of a paramilitary group. Fernandez said he walked most of the way to the US border – a journey of roughly 2,500 miles over Central America alone.\n\n“On foot I crossed Costa Rica, Nicaragua, parts of Guatemala and parts of México,” he said. “Sometimes people helped with food and cash.”\n\n“There were many good people along the way,” said Salvatierra. “In Panama, people stopped on the road and gave us food and water. They said they could not take us because they could be jailed for transporting migrants.”\n\nSalvatierra said he had migrated to Chile in 2018, supporting himself as well as his parents back home by working construction jobs. He raised about $1,400 and decided to head north in late June.\n\n“The money ran out by the time I got to Guatemala,” said Salvatierra, who clutched a miniature copy of the New Testament.\n\n“It was always in my hand,” he said the small book. “I’m not religious but I have faith. I carried it from Chile to Peru, from Ecuador to Colombia, across the Darien and Panama, from Costa Rica to Nicaragua, from Honduras to Guatemala and Mexico.”\n\nThe two migrants, who met in Texas, and others said they encountered bodies along desolate stretches of the Darién Gap. Those who were injured or ill were usually left behind to die, they said.\n\n“We embarked across the Darién with a total 339 people,” Salvatierra said. “About 230 reached Panama. Many died. We saw bodies … on the side of rivers. A friend traveling with his young son said he could not stop thinking of a dead child he saw.”\n\nFernandez and Salvatierra, standing under the glittering billboards near Times Square, asked a stranger if he knew of available jobs in the city. They’re staying at the intake shelter for single adult men in Manhattan until beds can be found in a longer-term facility.\n\n“We’re fortunate to have made it this far,” said Salvatierra, clutching his New Testament and court papers for his first immigration hearing next month, “even if we don’t have anyone here.”", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/americas/chile-rising-violence-drugs-intl-latam-cmd/index.html", "title": "As drug cartels expand their reach across Latin America, Chile takes ...", "text": "Santiago, Chile CNN —\n\nOn May 1, Francisca Sandoval, a young Chilean reporter, traveled to a commercial district of the capital, Santiago, to cover a union rally commemorating International Workers’ Day. It would be her final report.\n\nDuring the demonstration, violent clashes broke out between local gangs, protesters, and the police. A group of armed gang members fired shots, leaving three people injured, including Sandoval. The 29-year-old journalist died 12 days later.\n\nSandoval’s death has shed a spotlight on an astronomical rise in lethal violence recorded in the country. Similar incidents have long plagued countries such as Colombia and Brazil, but in Chile it’s a fairly new phenomenon. Data ranges across Chile’s public entities, however all present alarming figures. Between 2016 and 2021, homicides rose by 40%, according to Chile’s Department of Crime Prevention. Meanwhile, the National Prosecutor’s office found that murders rose by 66% from 2016-2020.\n\nAs homicides – and the use of firearms – continue to multiply, public safety has become one of newly elected President Gabriel Boric and his government’s top challenges. He is battling both a powerful influx of drug trade-related criminal activity in cities as well as drug traffickers who are exploiting historic tensions between the state and indigenous communities in the south – and who are now gaining control of territory amid an outbreak of violence.\n\nPolitically and economically stable, the country has long registered low crime rates compared to the rest of the region. Chile’s homicide rate stands at 3.6 per 100,000 people as of 2021, according to Insight Crime, a think-tank that provides information about organized crime in the Americas. Compared with Venezuela, at 40.9 per 100,000 people; Colombia, at 26.8 per 100,000; and Brazil, at 18.5, Chile still ranks low in comparison regionally, according to the organization’s annual “Homicide Round-Up” report. In the United States, the murder rate reached 7.8 per 100,000 in 2020, marking the highest annual increase in the rate of homicides in 100 years, according to CDC data.\n\nChileans call for justice at a vigil for the late journalist Francisca Sandoval in Santiago on May 13. Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, the Insight Crime report also states that “while Chile long avoided the type of criminal activity and gangs that plagued other countries, that no longer appears to be the case.”\n\nChile´s Department of Crime Prevention reported that homicides increased by nearly 30% between 2019 and 2020, with police attributing the rise to the pandemic, economic slowdown, and a resulting increase in illicit trade. While homicides dropped by 21.8% between 2020 and 2021, cumulative figures since 2017 show an overall uptick in the murder rate.\n\n“Chile’s situation is worrisome,” Juan Pablo Luna, a political scientist at the Institute of Political Science of the Catholic University of Chile told CNN, adding that it is not alone as it descends into violence.\n\n“Countries where the state is relatively strong and with solid democracies were supposed to be immune to this kind of scenario, but now we see that it was an illusion,” Luna said.\n\nHe pointed to Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador, among others in the region, who have also been confronted with rising crime.\n\nEcuador’s statistics are particularly striking, with homicides climbing by 84.4% in the past year, according to the country’s National Institute of Statistics and Census. In Uruguay, the Ministry of Interior recently said there had been more than a 33% increase within a year. In Peru, the government declared a state of emergency in Lima and the region of Callao earlier this year to fight crime, targeting mostly contract killings. And in Paraguay, murders by hitmen also rose significantly last year, according to Insight Crime.\n\nExperts attribute the rise in violence across the region to the expanding reach of global crime networks.\n\nAlejandra Mohor, a sociologist at the Center for Public Safety Studies of the Public Affairs Institute at the Universidad de Chile told CNN that “we are witnessing a higher infiltration of international organized crime in these countries.”\n\n“Because of globalization, the type of crimes we see have changed. In extremely violent countries like Colombia or Venezuela, you may not notice it, but in Chile, Ecuador Peru, Bolivia and probably Argentina, the level of specialization of this criminal business is having a huge impact because it´s new,” Mohor said.\n\nHowever, this expansion in Chile hasn’t happened overnight.\n\nA police officer patrols Santiago's Yungay neighborhood in April. Tamara Merino/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew criminal strategies have progressively developed over the past decade, but authorities failed at anticipating how seriously it would affect society, experts say.\n\nIn 2011, for example, Santiago Metropolitan Region’s Coroner Services warned in a report that gun-related murders were trending upwards. “The increase in deaths by firearms among young people in our country is a phenomenon that should draw our attention,” the report stated.\n\nBut it didn´t gain much traction with law enforcement or city officials, Mohor said. As violence grew, public policies implemented by the successive governments failed to address the basic needs of many low-income neighborhoods, which in turn, provided fertile ground for criminal groups to settle – and for the drug trade to proliferate.\n\n“We have people living in segregated areas, far from their workplace, with no good public transportation, and no schools or health services available. And when the state is absent, organized crime starts to fill that void,” she said.\n\nIn a 2021 article from the Urban Violence Research Network, researchers said that inequality in Latin America felt by the poor and working class with “few other options for survival” made them “easy recruits into the drug trade.”\n\n“The cocaine trade integrates marginalized territories that have been abandoned by the state into global markets and acts as a driver of development,” the organization said.\n\nParadoxically, prosperity is also considered a cause of the rising violence. More money means more drugs, according to Luna, and the commodities boom that favored South America until 2014 helped illicit businesses to thrive. Higher drug consumption also followed the increase of purchasing power, attracting new actors to the illegal economy, and consolidating southern drug trafficking routes.\n\nAll these factors triggered new territorial disputes between gangs and more violence in Chile, as well as in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Ecuador.\n\n‘Surrounded by drug dealers’\n\nN. G., who CNN is not identifying fully for safety concerns, lives in Santiago’s impoverished El Bosque neighborhood and has felt that transformation first-hand. The 28-year-old has lived with her mother in the same house since she was born – but now barely recognizes their block.\n\n“When I was a child, my main worry was that my mother would find me playing in the street instead of doing my homework when she got back home. Now I barely go out,” she said. “We live surrounded by drug dealers.”\n\nMost of the time, she says she is scared.\n\n“Every day we hear fireworks, because dealers use them as a signal that drug loads arrived, because there is a narco-funeral, or just to cover the noise of the shootings. We seldom see the police – we can’t live in peace,” she said.\n\nN. G. said that such insecurity has gotten worse since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Experts explain that the economic crisis, a rise in migrant smuggling along the Bolivian-Chilean border and police corruption have only exacerbated the problem, allowing organized crime to take on a whole new dimension.\n\nChilean police oversee a large seize of drugs, including cocaine and cannabis, in April. Patricio Cortes B./MinInter/ULA/Reuters\n\nLast September, the Chilean Observatory on Drugs warned about the rise of two Mexican cartels (the Sinaloa and the Jalisco New Generation) and a Colombian cartel (Cartel del Golfo) in Chile. Mexican cartels have also increased their operations in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, according to Ernesto López Portillo, coordinator of the public safety program at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.\n\nAnother notorious cartel that’s also now made their mark in Chile is the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua, one of the continent’s most dangerous criminal organizations, according to Insight Crime and Ximena Chong, a chief prosecutor in Santiago. Its leaders have taken advantage of the migration crisis in the north to tighten their grip on new territories, according to Insight Crime.\n\nTo cement their hold, transnational criminal groups are adapting to each new country by making new alliances with local gangs, Mohor explained.\n\n“We are not talking about drug trafficking or micro trafficking anymore,” Chong told CNN. “These are organizations that work like holdings, with a diversity of illicit activities: murder for hire, illicit firearms trafficking, extorsion, human trafficking, sexual exploitation and more.”\n\nIn this context, many South American countries don´t have the means to properly address the issue, Chong said, as the criminal groups’ tactics are evolving quicker than many country’s abilities to investigate them. Chile, for example, is lacking in specialized police forces, innovative police technologies, and of adequate witness protection programs. All this coupled with corruption represents huge obstacles to prosecuting and sanctioning criminal groups, Chong added.\n\n“We need to develop new prosecution strategies that go beyond specific criminal events, above all considering that, internationally, we are seeing criminal organizations permeating public services,” she said.\n\nThe day after Sandoval, the Chilean journalist, was shot, a man with previous criminal record for drug-dealing was arrested and has since been charged with her killing, Chilean media reported. The weapon he allegedly used has not yet been found, however authorities have established that the bullet was a calibre 40. The presidential delegate for Santiago’s Metropolitan Region said the shooting was connected to organized crime and lax gun control, two issues the government are set to tackle.\n\n“States are completely incapable of dismantling transnational organized crime,” López Portillo said.\n\n“This is affecting the health of democracies and weakening the already fragile rule of law. And the countries that had less violence are not exempt from this reality because criminal markets have no frontiers and never will.”", "authors": ["Daniela Mohor W.

Stop your engines!”, an officer screams. Powerful flashlights reveal a 32-foot, single-engine boat, crowded with immigrants — some of them small children — lying on the floor of the vessel. They are Venezuelan nationals, the Coast Guard later establishes. The footage was provided to CNN by the Colombian government.\n\nThis scene has been repeating itself with regularity around the Colombian San Andres Archipelago, located 775 kilometers (482 miles) northwest of mainland Colombia where the Colombian Coast Guard routinely intercepts boats loaded with migrants who pay smugglers to take them across the Caribbean.\n\nArriving in Central American countries like Nicaragua, the trip allows the migrants to avoid the perilous Darien Gap, a jungle region in Panama at the Colombian border that is also used by migrants trekking north with the hope of eventually reaching the United States.\n\nColombian Marine Corps Captain Octavio Gutiérrez, who serves in the San Andrés Archipelago, says migrants fly into the islands where they spend a night or two as they try to get in touch with smugglers.\n\n“Originally, [the smugglers] were charging between 1,000 and 1,500 dollars. Now we’re getting testimonies of people who have paid the smugglers as much as 4,000 dollars per person to be transported from San Andrés to Central America,” the captain said.\n\nVenezuelan migrants arrive at Canaan Membrillo village, the first border control of the Darien Province in Panama, on October 13, 2022. Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGutiérrez says that, during the month of September, the Coast Guard confiscated 35 boats while conducting 29 operations targeting smugglers in the zone.\n\nFrom the beginning of the year through the end of September, the Coast Guard has detained 14 smugglers transporting 526 migrants, including children. And the number of migrants trying to reach Central America has been steadily increasing.\n\nFrom South America to the United States, trying to stop yet another wave of migrants seems to be a losing battle. As CNN reported last month, US Customs and Border Protection encounters along the US-Mexico border have already topped 2 million so far this fiscal year, according to newly released agency data, with migration from authoritarian nations Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba driving numbers up.\n\nAnd many migrants’ testimonies suggest, more than ever, they are willing to face any risk and pay ever increasing amounts of money to reach their American dream.\n\n‘I’m making this sacrifice to give my children a better life’\n\nIn the span of just one week at the end of September, the Colombian Coast Guard detained 131 migrants, it told CNN. Though there were citizens from Cuba, Peru and Ecuador, most were Venezuelans, it said — an observation echoed by migration officials in other transit countries, like Panama and Guatemala.\n\nMany are young men like Mario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, whom CNN found walking along a highway in eastern Guatemala, told CNN that the country’s crushing economic conditions had forced them out.\n\n“Venezuela is unlivable. The economic crisis has been very hard, and the truth is that I’m making this sacrifice to give my children a better life,” Mosquera, a married father of three, said.\n\n“Minimum wage [in Venezuela] is not even enough for food. I left my country in search of a better future for me, for my mother and my siblings,” Lozada said.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the New York-based humanitarian NGO International Rescue Committee, an estimated one-third of the population —over 9 million people — faced hunger in 2019. “While data in Venezuela is often limited or missing entirely, this figure is likely growing; 14% of all children under age 5 in Venezuela suffer from global acute malnutrition; 57% of pregnant women are malnourished,” it said.\n\nMario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, walk along a highway in eastern Guatemala. CNN\n\nThe number of Venezuelans who have fled their country has already surpassed 7.1 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency. It surpasses countries like Ukraine (6.8 million) and Syria (6.6 million). These figures are striking because, unlike the other two nations, the South American country is not at war.\n\nIn Caracas, CNN spoke with another man who says he’s desperate to get out of Venezuela and has already decided he will leave his country for the United States. He declined to reveal his identity because he works for the government of Venezuela.\n\nHis government job pays about five dollars a week, which forces him to hold two other jobs to make ends meet, he said.\n\n“The real question is how to get to the United States,” the 38-year-old added, saying that he has no visa for the United States, Mexico, or the Central American countries he would have to travel through.\n\nA man pushes a cart with pumpkins outside a public market in San Cristobal, Venezuela, April 7, 2022.

What to ...", "text": "As health officials continue to track and manage one of the largest bird flu outbreaks in recorded history, the virus is beginning to spill over into mammals – including humans.\n\nWhile human infections are still few and far between, health experts say it only takes one perfect combination of mutations for the virus to cause widespread transmission among the human population.\n\n“There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what is currently happening with bird flu and what might happen in the future,” said Dr. Jay Varma, director of Cornell University’s Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response.\n\nWill avian influenza be the next human pandemic, and is the world ready? Here's what we know.\n\nAvian influenza:What to know about bird flu symptoms in humans\n\nWhy are eggs so expensive? Here's what to know.\n\nTracking avian influenza: How widespread is it?\n\nBird flu has been on officials’ radar since the late 1990s, health experts say.\n\nThe strains causing widespread outbreak now – avian influenza A (H5N1) 2.3.4.4b viruses – first arose in 2020 and spread via migratory birds to Africa, Asia and Europe, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn late 2021, the H5N1 strains crossed to North America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports over 58 million chickens have been affected in 47 states. Nearly 6,200 wild birds have been infected including eagles, hawks, geese and ducks, as of this week.\n\n“It seems like it spreads very easily among different bird species. You have so many different bird species that die off so rapidly from it,” said Varma, who is also the chief medical adviser at Kroll, a risk consulting firm.\n\nHealth experts, however, are more concerned with how the virus is affecting mammals. The USDA has detected H5N1 in various animals all over the country including skunks, foxes, raccoons, bears, mountain lions and dolphins, among others.\n\nMost of these infections appear to be individual cases where the animal may have gotten sick from eating an infected bird, experts say.\n\nMammalian transmission: Why experts are concerned\n\nHowever, two instances of possible mammalian transmission have rung alarm bells for health experts.\n\nBetween June and mid-July, over 150 dead seals in Maine were attributed to the bird flu, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Although it’s possible the seals could have eaten infected birds, health experts say the large number of dead seals and their proximity to one another suggests mammal-to-mammal transmission.\n\nAnother outbreak on a Spanish mink farm suggests the virus may have adapted to mammal transmission. Scientific investigators were called when minks began showing signs of infection including loss of appetite, hypersalivation, depression, bloody snout and tremors.\n\nAfter swabbing two infected animals, they determined the rest of the sickened minks had bird flu. It’s unclear exactly how many minks were infected, but researchers noted the animals began dying a few days after exhibiting symptoms.\n\nMore than 51,000 minks were killed to prevent further spread. Post-mortem examination of infected minks found pneumonia in their lungs. This also sounded the alarm for health experts, who say a mink's respiratory tract is closer to that of a human than bird.\n\n\"Ferrets, which are close relatives of mink, are our best animal model for human influenza infection,\" said Stephen Morse, a professor epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"So, finding natural infection in mink seems a step closer to potentially infecting humans.\"\n\nAfter sequencing the offending strain, researchers discovered the H5N1 had a slight mutation that doesn't exist in strain affecting birds. This \"uncommon\" mutation – T271A in the PB2 gene – was also seen in the swine flu H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic that the CDC estimates caused more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S.\n\n“We worry that this might be the prelude to the virus mutating in such a way that becomes a human epidemic,\" Varma said.\n\nWhat is Valley fever?Fungal infection from the Southwest may spread with climate change.\n\nCan humans get bird flu? How does it spread to humans?\n\nAs of December, the WHO has reported six human infections from the circulating bird flu strains in China, Spain, the U.K., the U.S. and Vietnam.\n\nAll four cases in the U.S. and Europe were asymptomatic or mild infections, with fatigue reported as the only symptom. The patient in Vietnam developed severe disease but recovered, while the patient in China died.\n\n“So far, the virus is difficult to transmit between people and the overwhelming majority of cases have been in people who have in direct and close contact with birds,” said Dr. Hana El Sahly, professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nBird flu tends to infect the lower respiratory tract, showing “it has a preference” in the lungs, said Dr. Katherine Baumgarten, medical director for infection control and prevention at Ochsner Health.\n\nThis suggests it could be less transmissible between humans because not as many viral particles are concentrated in the upper respiratory tract, like the nose or mouth, she said. But it also suggests the virus may be more capable of causing severe disease.\n\nCan avian influenza cause a human pandemic?\n\nAlthough researchers have identified certain mutations that may be associated with mammalian adaptation, health experts say these genes don’t seem to support widespread transmission between animals.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. The more virus spreads, the more opportunities it gets to mutate and adapt.\n\n“Flu viruses are always evolving, making them very unpredictable,” Morse said. “Could it spill over to the human population, and could it eventually become a pandemic? We really can’t say. It’s possible, but we don’t know how likely or, if it happens, when.”\n\nGovernment agencies and international organizations track and study cases among birds, mammals and humans to detect any abnormalities that would be a cause for concern.\n\nHealth experts say it’s important to prepare for the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic because humans don’t have any immunity to the virus and it’s likely to cause severe disease.\n\nIs the US ready for a bird flu pandemic?\n\nIn addition to surveillance, health experts say the U.S. needs vaccines, treatments and personal protective equipment to prevent spread.\n\nThe United States has antivirals for the seasonal influenza virus – the most widely used is known by its brand name Tamiflu – but health experts say it’s unclear if those will work against the circulating H5N1 strains.\n\nA vaccine for H5N1 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people 18 through 64 years who are at increased risk of exposure, according to an agency spokesperson.\n\nThe country has a small supply of vaccine, a spokesperson from the Health and Human Services told USA TODAY. The vaccine can be used to match against strains with pandemic potential and scale-up as needed, which health experts estimate could take up to six months.\n\nAbout 100 public health laboratories across the country are also equipped with testing that can detect H5 viruses or novel influenza A viruses, according to the CDC.\n\nEven if testing wasn't available, a CDC spokesperson told USA TODAY that most commercial testing for the seasonal flu would be able to detect a new influenza A virus should an outbreak occur.\n\nHow to protect yourself against the bird flu\n\nTo prevent infection, the CDC recommends avoiding unprotected contact with wild or domesticated birds that may look sick or have died. If contact can't be avoided, the agency recommends:\n\nWearing personal protective equipment, like disposable gloves, boots, an N95 mask and eye protection.\n\nAvoid touching your mouth, nose or eyes during and after contact with birds or contaminated surfaces.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water.\n\nChange your clothes after contact.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

He was a Boy Scout who enjoyed getting outdoors and camping. He played with Legos and liked to skateboard. He slept with a stuffed Iron Man figure and still snuggled with a teddy bear he’d had since he was much younger.\n\nBut about a year and a half ago, the middle schooler confessed to his parents about a very adult problem: He was experimenting with oxycodone, a prescription painkiller.\n\nHe had no idea that the pills he was taking were actually prescription knockoffs laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Just a few milligrams of fentanyl can be a fatal dose.\n\nOne morning in June 2020, his mother, Amy, found him dead in his bedroom.\n\n“I went to his room, and he was blue, just laying on his beanbag chair. Just like he had gone to bed, you know, just like he had fallen asleep there,” she said.\n\nDrug deaths more than double\n\nThough still rare, drug deaths among children ages 10 to 14 more than tripled from 2019 to 2020, according to an analysis done for CNN by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnintentional drug overdoses led to 200,000 years of lost life for US preteens and teens who died between 2015 and 2019, a January study found. And experts suspect that the problem has gotten worse during the pandemic, research shows.\n\nThe trend among adolescents follows a wider one.\n\nAnnual drug overdose deaths have reached another record high in the United States, with an estimated 104,288 in the 12-month period ending September 2021, according to provisional data published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThat’s double the number from six years prior; there were an estimated 52,000 drug overdose deaths annually in September 2015.\n\nThe fentanyl factor\n\nAlexander Neville had gone to his parents to ask them for help just two days before he died. He told them he had started on the pills, in large part, because he was curious.\n\n“He said, ‘I got to tell you something. I wanted to experiment with oxy – oxycodone. I looked up how much to take for my size, so I wouldn’t get addicted. But it really has got a hold on me. And I don’t know why,’ ” his mother said.\n\nHis parents immediately made calls to get him into treatment.\n\n“He really wanted to stop completely,” Alexander’s father, Aaron, recalled.\n\nAmy remembered, “He wanted to be done. He’s like, ‘I’m done. I thought this stuff was going to be fun, but it’s not.’ “\n\nBut Alexander took that one last pill, unaware it was actually a deadly fake.\n\nTests later showed that the pill had enough fentanyl in it to kill at least four people, according to a toxicology report that his parents obtained.\n\nFentanyl is a drug intended to help people like cancer patients manage severe pain. It’s 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. But most overdose deaths aren’t from using it legitimately; rather, they are linked to fentanyl made illegally. Four out of every 10 fake pills with fentanyl contain a potentially deadly dose, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nSince 2013, a rise in opioid deaths involved illicitly made fentanyl, according to the CDC. The agency says dealers combine it with counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the spike in deaths has increased significantly. From May 2020 through April 2021, more than 100,000 people of all ages died from drug overdoses in the US, according to the CDC. That’s a record – a near-30% rise from a year earlier and a near doubling over the past five years. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl accounted for the bulk of those deaths – around 64,000.\n\n“We’re dealing with a different drug threat. Fentanyl has changed the game,” DEA Special Agent Robert Murphy said. “I’ve been in law enforcement my entire adult life – so it’s 31 years now. And I’ve never seen a threat of the drug threat like the one we’re dealing with now. It’s frightening.”\n\nSocial media makes drug deals easy\n\nSocial media may also contribute to the problem. Drug dealers no longer have to stand on streetcorners. They can now connect with kids online through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, Murphy said.\n\nAlexander’s parents believe that he got his fake pills through Snapchat. Another parent in the area got in touch to tell them that her son died two weeks after Alexander did, and she had screengrabs of a conversation believed to be with a drug dealer through Snapchat. There’s still an investigation underway.\n\n“The fentanyl epidemic has had a devastating effect on the lives of too many Americans, and our hearts go out to the families who have suffered unimaginable losses,” a Snap spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“We share their outrage over how drug dealers have abused online platforms, including Snapchat, and are working tirelessly to eradicate them from our platform. We use tools to proactively detect drug-dealing activity and shut down dealers. To help inform our ongoing strategy and efforts, we work closely with a wide range of experts in counternarcotics, the law enforcement community, and government agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Agency, as well as with families. We are committed to bringing every resource to bear to fight this national crisis both on Snapchat and across the tech industry, particularly by raising awareness about the dangers of counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl.”\n\nBuying drugs is as easy as planting a string of emojis on a social media platform to signal the interest in a sale, Murphy said. The DEA says drug traffickers and the criminal networks are there waiting for you.\n\nDealers may reassure people that their pills are fentanyl-free, but there’s no easy way to tell by looking at them, nor is it easy to know how much fentanyl is in them.\n\n“That’s why it could be a ‘one pill kill,’ because we don’t know the dose,” said Dr. Robert Bassett, assistant associate director of the Poison Control Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It’s like driving at night with your headlights off.”\n\nThe opioid overdose antidote\n\nFentanyl has become such a big problem among young people that some schools have started keeping naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses that’s available under the brand name Narcan, on hand.\n\nHartford, Connecticut, is one example. In January, a 13-year-old boy died after collapsing in gym class at a Hartford school. Two other seventh-graders were taken to Connecticut Children’s for treatment and evaluation. Police found 40 bags of fentanyl at the school and 100 bags in boy’s bedroom.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American Medical Association encouraged the Biden administration to remove the prescription status of naloxone to make it more easily available over the counter.\n\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia have some form of naloxone access laws that allow for the prescribing and dispensing of the treatment to substance users vulnerable to overdose and to nonmedical first responders like family and friends, according to the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. As of 2020, at least 20 states allow schools to possess naloxone and administer it, but they are not required to do so.\n\nHow to get help\n\nThough the experts say there are not enough counselors and treatment programs for preteens and teens, there are treatment programs that work for adolescents.\n\nThe first step in successful treatment is recognition. Parents need to stay vigilant for changes in a child’s behavior, which may be an early sign that they’re using drugs.\n\nThe changes can be subtle at first, Bassett said. They may not hang out with the same friends or may stop showing interest in favorite activities. They may be angry or sleep more. But parents need to talk to their kids about it – even middle schoolers – and do it more than once.\n\n“This is not a ‘one conversation and forget it.’ This is something you’re going to have to just pound in terms of every night at the kitchen table,” Murphy said.\n\nChildren’s brains aren’t fully formed, and their risk-reward centers may not help them make the right choices all the time. “They’re the perfect, most vulnerable population,” Bassett said.\n\nBassett recommends that parents check with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for resources. They can also call Poison Control at (800) 222-1222 for free inforrmation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is considered more effective than abstinence, Bassett said. Wraparound services, individualized treatment to help the child and family, can include peer counseling and drug rehabilitation. And, Bassett said, it may be important to address underlying issues that lead the child to experiment with the drugs in the first place.\n\n“There may be unmet psychological conditions that force people into self-medicating,” Bassett said. “They’re just looking not to suffer.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/09/15/wolves-oregon-northern-cascade-mountains/10387136002/", "title": "Wolves spotted in federally-protected Cascade Mountains amid ...", "text": "Claire Rush\n\nAssociated Press/Report for America\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon wildlife officials said Tuesday they have identified a new family of wolves in the northern Cascade Mountains, bringing the total number of known wolf groups in the region to three.\n\nThe state Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed the new family of wolves with two adults and two pups.

It was the slowest rate of wolf growth since 2016, although agency officials did add that wolves expanded their range into four new areas of activity in rural areas in Jefferson, Klamath, Grant and Union counties.\n\nThe number of documented packs in 2021 decreased from 22 to 21 after an entire pack was killed by poisoning in eastern Oregon.

The medical staff had given him the antibiotics two weeks prior.\n\n“They are taking too long; it hurts me too much,’’ said Perdomo, who is from Colombia. “It’s like I’m an animal.”\n\nHudson Correctional has come under scrutiny over the care it provides to detainees after allegations of medical neglect in the June death of a 44-year-old immigrant from El Salvador who was being held at the jail. After several months of not receiving all the medication he needed for his ailments, according to the man's family and his attorney, he suffered from internal bleeding and died two days later. His death is being investigated by the county; two members of the jail's medical staff have been dismissed.\n\nINVESTIGATION:Hudson County jail has a history of complaints\n\nDETAINEE DEATH:A case of mistaken identity, then a death\n\nAdvocates who help immigrant detainees said they have been receiving calls for years from people at the jail who say they are not receiving adequate medical care. Rosa Santana, volunteer coordinator for First Friends of New Jersey and New York, an organization that sends volunteers to visit detainees, said the medical complaints the organization has received vary from people not getting help for migraines to those suffering from infections they claim are going untreated.\n\n“They are getting a lot of money, so these people shouldn’t be treated the way they are being treated and not given the correct medical care,’’ Santana said. “What we are fighting for is for them to have the care that they need. Not meeting those needs is a human rights violation.”\n\nSince he has been detained at the jail, Henry Medrano said, he has seen a varicose vein on his right leg grow and become more painful. The 31-year-old Medrano, who said he is a cousin of the detainee who recently died, said he notified staff at the jail, but hasn’t gotten the help he needs to deal with the searing pain and discomfort that make standing up a challenge at times.\n\n“I feel pain on the bottom of my foot, and it’s something that is hurting me,’’ he said in Spanish, noting that a doctor who saw him at the facility three months ago said he might have a blockage. “Maybe one day I’m not going to be able to stand up.”\n\nAbout two months ago, he was taken to a specialist outside the jail, but the doctor looked at his leg and said he wasn't the right specialist for the issue.\n\n“The doctor entered and said ‘I don’t know why they brought you here, since I don’t work on that,' ’’ he recalled. “They made an appointment with a specialist that had nothing to do with what I needed.”\n\nHe said he has been asking for weeks to see the right specialist.\n\nAl Campana, CEO of CFG Health Systems, which provides medical services at Hudson, said that overall if detainees have problems, they should share them with medical staff or submit formal grievances so they can get help. He said the medical director makes regular rounds and asks individuals if they have issues with their care.\n\n“We’re not here to hide anything. We’re here to take care of people,” he said.\n\nCampana said advocates should let him know if any detainee has shared medical complaints or concerns with them. Often, detainees are more comfortable sharing with advocates than medical staff, but the advocates haven’t brought any cases to his attention during monthly meetings, he said.\n\nSantana, however, said that when her group is notified about a medical issue, they reach out to the jail and convey the detainee’s medical concerns and needs to a supervisor. “We document things that are going on in the jail and we try to address them,’’ she said.\n\nIn the cases of Perdomo and Medrano, Campana said that both men had seen specialists and they both have follow-up plans for their health care. Perdomo had said his biopsy had been scheduled for July 31.\n\nPerdomo, who came to the United States in 1974, said that besides his need for a biopsy, he has chronic back, neck and shoulder pain from a 2001 accident when he was hit by a car as he worked as a bike messenger. The accident led to multiple operations, said his attorney, Mia Unger.\n\n“He really has extensive medical needs with regards to his disability from this accident, and he has been declared completely physically disabled as a result of that accident,’’ she said.\n\nBefore he was taken to the jail, Perdomo received physical therapy, a few times a week, and cortisone shots in his right shoulder and left knee, and he said he took Percocet for stronger pain. In jail, his only treatment has been Motrin and Tylenol.\n\n“I do not know how I stand this pain; with the help of God I'm enduring it,’’ he said in Spanish.\n\nPerdomo has to go up and down six flights of steps to see a doctor or meet with his lawyer and family when they visit, a painful task, he said. Unger and Perdomo said he has asked for an elevator pass for months, with no success.\n\n“It’s pretty outrageous. He has really complex medical needs, and this is civil detention, and to me it’s heartbreaking to have a client who is confined in civil detention and going through these type of problems,’’ his lawyer said.\n\nNelson Fernandez, 47, says he, too, knows what it’s like to be sick and detained at the Hudson County jail waiting to be treated. Just days after he was taken into custody, Fernandez, who has a rare autoimmune disease, found himself in the hospital with internal bleeding.\n\nAt the jail he didn't pay attention to the medication they were giving him. At home, he said, he was taking blood thinners to prevent blood clots caused by Behcet’s disease, a disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout the body.\n\n“They started giving me six, seven different medications, some pills I never saw in my life,’’ Fernandez said in a telephone interview from the Dominican Republic, to which he was deported in 2014 and where he currently lives. “One of those medications that they were giving me made my blood so thin that I started to bleed internally.”\n\nHe said he told medical staff about the bleeding and it took several days before he was taken to East Orange Hospital. “It took them a while for them to notice I was really sick,’’ he said.\n\nAn evaluation of health services provided to the immigrant detainee population housed at the correctional center done by a committee appointed by the county later reviewed the treatment given to Fernandez.\n\n“Upon review of Mr. Fernandez’s medical chart, it appears that all of his medical care was appropriately and timely provided,\" the report noted.\n\nFernandez disputed several details of the report.\n\n“They didn’t give me the right medicine; they didn’t treat me and didn’t give me the blood tests I needed,’’ he said. “So that’s not true. They are not saying the truth.”\n\nHe said that after he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to the jail, it took a few days to get his regular prescriptions — and his daughter had to make several calls to help him get them.\n\n“It was hard for me, and I speak the language, and I explained to the doctor what condition I was in, and it was hard for me to get my medication,’’ he said. “I imagine for other people who don’t speak the language or who don’t have somebody outside doing something for them it’s harder.”\n\nStaff Writer Hannan Adely contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/27"}]}

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nThe clashing of two stars\n\nThis match had been billed as Kylian Mbappé vs. Messi – the 23-year-old French star ready to assume the mantle of the world’s greatest player from his 35-year-old Paris Saint-Germain teammate.\n\nMbappé was defending France’s 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, Messi was playing in his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which has eluded him for so long and which would enable him to match Diego Maradona’s achievement of winning the 1986 competition.\n\nThe opening 79 minutes was all about Messi. Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to La Albiceleste’s second.\n\nThen in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.\n\nMessi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.\n\nExcept it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.\n\nBoth Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.\n\nOver two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.\n\nMbappé sits on the bench at the end of the World Cup final. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nFrom the spot\n\nThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.\n\nSometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.\n\nMessi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.\n\nMbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumption.\n\nMbappé scores France's third goal against Argentina in the World Cup final. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.\n\nArgentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.\n\nIn Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.\n\nA penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.\n\nMartínez saves the penalty from Kingsley Coman of France in the World Cup final. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGreat goals\n\nWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.\n\nArgentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.\n\nArgentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.\n\nIt was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.\n\nAfter Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.\n\nUnselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 up.\n\nDi María celebrates after he scored Argentina's second goal against France in the World Cup final. Stefan Matzke/sampics/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.\n\nAfter his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.\n\nWith seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.\n\nThese are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nIt will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.\n\nOther great World Cup finals\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of competition for the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’\n\nIn 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, while four years later, West Germany provided another huge surprise, beating Hungary’s Magical Magyars, earning the country its first World Cup title.\n\nGeoff Hurst scored the first World Cup final hat-trick in the 1966 final between England and West Germany. Hurst’s second goal is still talked about 56 years later – had the ball crossed the line? It did, according to the game’s officials and England won 4-2.\n\nThe 1970 final marked Pelé’s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.\n\nFour years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup.\n\nMuch like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\nIn 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.\n\nHowever, with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/957530/2022-2023-premier-league-predictions-odds-title-winners-relegation", "title": "2022-2023 Premier League season: predictions, odds, title winners ...", "text": "The 2022-2023 Premier League season gets underway a week earlier than the last campaign due to the Fifa World Cup taking place in November and December.\n\nMatchweek 16, the weekend of 12-13 November, will be the final one before the six-week World Cup break. The action will then resume on Boxing Day, just a week after the World Cup final in Qatar. The Premier League’s final round of matches are scheduled for 28 May.\n\nManchester City come into the new season looking to win the title for the third time in succession. Pep Guardiola’s side edged out rivals Liverpool by just one point on a wild final day of last season. Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United will aim to close the gap on the big two and challenge at the top of the table.\n\nFulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest, the three clubs promoted from the Championship, will aim to stave off relegation as they return to the top-flight.\n\nHere we pick out the pundit predictions for the Premier League champions and relegation candidates, plus the betting odds for title winners, relegation, golden boot and first manager to be sacked.\n\nTitle race predictions: who will finish top? Given Manchester City have won four of the last five titles, “it’s hardly a bold prediction” they will win again, said Ben Gray on 101GreatGoals.com. Pep Guardiola has won ten league titles in 13 attempts and, “while he remains in place in Manchester, this tally is only likely to rise”. The analysts from FiveThirtyEight have crunched the numbers ahead of the new top-flight campaign. According to the data, champions Man City have a 46% chance of winning the title ahead of Liverpool (30%) and Chelsea (11%). City “look in very good shape” to become the only team alongside neighbours United to win three Premier Leagues in a row and five in six seasons, said Dom Farrell on SportingNews.com. “It is hard once again to look past Guardiola’s champions.” ESPN commentator Ian Darke has made his Premier League predictions for 2022-2023 and there’s “nothing that original” there. “It’s going to be another close race between Manchester City and Liverpool,” he said. “Tottenham you’d think with the way they’ve strengthened might put in a much stronger run than what we’ve seen from them. They could make third place.” Football analyst Statman Dave has published his predictions. He probably has “a better shout at getting things right” compared to, say, “the bloke in the corner of your local crying into his pint, AKA, yours truly”, said Kobe Tong on GiveMeSport. In a YouTube video the statman predicts the entire Premier League table, with “frightening” Man City lifting the trophy ahead of Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal, who complete the top four.\n\nRelegation predictions: which teams will go down? Dom Farrell on SportingNews.com picks Bournemouth and Fulham, “two of the three newboys”, to go down. So, “who of the established names” will join them? “If Southampton get into a spiral this season, that might be allowed to go too far downward before corrective measures are applied, meaning the Championship beckons.” FiveThirtyEight’s data revealed that Nottingham Forest have a 45% chance of being relegated this season. Bournemouth (44%) and Fulham (41%) are also expected to struggle. Statman Dave predicts that Everton will join Fulham and Bournemouth in the drop zone at the end of the season. “Consistently bad decisions” have left Everton in “serious trouble”, he said. “Their squad doesn’t have an identity and is filled with players whose best days are behind them.”", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/lionel-messi-argentina-saudi-arabia-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia vs Argentina: Lionel Messi's team in one of the biggest ...", "text": "Lusail, Qatar CNN —\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nAll the pre-match talk focused on Messi, one of the greatest players ever who is playing in what is likely to be his last World Cup. The Argentina captain scored an early penalty to put his side in the lead, but two second-half goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head.\n\nThe thousands of Saudi fans inside the Lusail Stadium couldn’t believe what they were watching as they celebrated their unexpected victory.\n\nSuch a comeback hadn’t looked remotely possible for much of the match. Argentina controlled the game after taking the lead but whatever Saudi manger Hervé Renard said at halftime worked. His team came out with a new-found belief and stood toe-to-toe with Argentina’s world-class team.\n\nSaudi Arabia players celebrate their shock win. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAl Dawsari’s incredible winner from distance – and subsequent acrobatic celebration – will become one of the moments of this or any World Cup and undoubtedly, in time, an ‘I-was-there’ moment for fans.\n\nAs full-time neared, fans cheered every tackle and save as if they were goals and, when the match did indeed end, Saudi Arabia fans reacted with frenzy.\n\nBoth sets of players sunk to their knees, from disbelief and exhaustion. Messi, who so many had come see play, looked distraught as he walked off with Saudi fans cheering his name ironically.\n\nAccording to sports data group Gracenote, which is a Nielsen company, Tuesday’s result was the biggest upset in the history of the competition.\n\n“The most surprising World Cup win ever according to Gracenote was USA’s victory over England in 1950 with a 9.5% chance of victory for the US team but Saudi Arabia’s chance of victory today was estimated at 8.7% so takes over at number one,” it said in a statement.\n\nAs much as this was a historic win for Saudi Arabia, it was a humiliating defeat for Argentina who capitulated on the biggest stage.\n\nSaudi players smiled and laughed with reporters as they left the stadium, a stark contrast to the Argentine squad who walked with their heads down onto the team bus. Messi was one of the few to stop and speak to journalists and even stopped for photos.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nDefender Yuto Nagatomo said memories of the defeat by Belgium four years ago, when Japan let a 2-0 lead slip and lost to a stoppage-time goal, will drive the players on this time.\n\n“I have never forgotten about that battle against Belgium. Sometimes, scenes from the match suddenly come back to me and the last four years have been very tough,” the full back told reporters Sunday.\n\n“But I think we have grown mentally as well as physically and … as far as I can see, this team is the best and the strongest that has ever competed for Japan at the World Cup.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nCan previous meetings between these two countries help give us a sense of what may happen on Monday? Perhaps not. Since 1997, they have played each other three times, with Japan winning a friendly 4-3, but losing to Croatia in the group stage at France 1998. At the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the two teams played out a 0-0 draw.\n\nAccording to sports data company Gracenote, Croatia has a 58% chance of winning this match, while Japan’s chances stand at 42%.\n\nBut Croatia is a possession-based team, which might suit Japan given it beat Germany and Spain with 17.7% and 26.1% possession respectively.\n\nDalić added: “They will apply the samurai warrior philosophy. So will we. If we want to go further, we must apply that same attitude, do our best and never underestimate anyone.\n\n“Japan have the least ball possession in the world, but they make great transition. This is the most perseverant, persistent opponent. They simply do not give up. We have a similar mentality, Japan and Croatia. We stand on equal ground.”\n\nInjury-hit Brazil still favorite\n\nNeymar injured his ankle against Serbia. Lars Baron/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOn paper, the day’s other knockout match is easier to predict as five-time champion Brazil takes on South Korea at Stadium 974 in Doha.\n\nThough Brazil lost to Cameroon 1-0 in its last group match, it is still the overwhelming favorite to progress to the quarterfinals, where either Japan or Croatia will await.\n\nWith progress to the knockout stages already secured, manager Tite made nine changes to the team that won 1-0 against Switzerland, which could account for the country’s first loss to an African nation in a World Cup. Though that should not take anything away from Cameroon’s performance.\n\nA dramatic 2-1 comeback win over Portugal, with Hwang Hee-chan scoring the added-time winner, secured South Korea’s spot in the last 16. Prior to that match, the Taegeuk Warriors had only won one of their previous 11 World Cup matches.\n\nVictory for South Korea this time, however, would be monumental, especially as it seems likely star forward Neymar will be fit to play after recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nSon Heung-min celebrates victory over Portugal. ODD ANDERSEN/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut the tournament favorite has suffered a number of injuries to key players in Qatar, with Alex Telles’ knee injury against Cameroon leaving Brazil short of full backs. Telles and forward Gabriel Jesus were ruled out for the rest of the tournament by the Brazilian FA on Saturday, while it is unclear when usual starting full backs Danilo and Alex Sandro will recover from their injuries.\n\nThe two countries have never played each other at a World Cup, but have met seven times – Brazil winning six times and South Korea winning once in 1999. Their most recent encounter was in June in Seoul, which Brazil won 5-1.\n\nBut as the only Asian country to have reached a World Cup semifinal, South Korea has pedigree – and it also has Tottenham star Son Heung-min, its talisman and one of best players in the English Premier League.\n\nSouth Korea’s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento told reporters Sunday: “We’re up against world-class players, we are not intimidated. In our squad, we have world-class players.\n\n“One match, it’s not an entire tournament, we have one chance … Most important is we show we are a team that wants to win, wants to compete and fight until the last whistle.”\n\nWhen and where\n\nJapan vs. Croatia: 10 a.m. ET at the Al Janoub Stadium\n\nBrazil vs. South Korea: 2 p.m. ET at the Stadium 974, Doha\n\nHow to watch\n\nUS: Fox Sports\n\nUK: BBC or ITV\n\nAustralia: SBS\n\nBrazil: SportTV\n\nGermany: ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Telekom\n\nCanada: Bell Media\n\nSouth Africa: SABC", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/football/quarterfinals-qatar-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "World Cup quarterfinals: Qualifying teams, fixtures and schedule ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAll eight teams have now booked their places in the World Cup quarterfinals.

Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCroatia\n\nPerhaps the weakest team on paper in the quarterfinals, Croatia looks like a side struggling to reclaim the control that took it all the way to the final in 2018. The team was held comfortably by Morocco in the group stages, was very lucky to draw with Belgium and had to rely on penalties to beat Japan in the last 16..\n\nFor any other team, that would be a worry. But Croatia has shown that it is the master of navigating matches that go down to the wire. All three of its knockout games in 2018 went to extra-time or penalties, but in every one of those, the Croatians looked like the side in control.\n\nThat experience was on show against Japan. Like its semifinal victory over England four years ago, this was a game in which Croatia looked stronger and stronger as the game went on. That tournament experience and nous will be put to the test as Kockasti face a Brazil team that looks every bit as good as its pre-tournament tag as favorite would suggest.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nCroatia 4-1 Canada\n\nCroatia 0-0 Belgium\n\nRound of 16:\n\nCroatia 1-1 Japan (Croatia won 3-1 on penalties)\n\nAccording to Opta, Brazil has a 27.6% chance of winning the World Cup. Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nBrazil\n\nA Seleção, for the first time in 20 years, looks as good as fans expect. The five-time world champion comfortably beat stubborn European opponent, Serbia, before giving the first team a rest against Cameroon. But against South Korea, the world saw what this team is truly capable of.\n\nWithin the first seven minutes, Brazil had already won the match and brought jogo bonito (the beautiful game) back to the World Cup, scoring for fun. Neymar – after missing the final two group stage matches through injury – was back again and playing with a freedom that the star has rarely been able to exhibit in the green and gold shirt.\n\nBrazil will once again be heavy favorite as it faces Croatia, but manager Tite and his team will not be underestimating its opponent. For the last 16 years, Brazil has come to tournaments with hype before crashing out against European opponents in the knockout stages. But this team looks like it could be the first since 2002 to bring the World Cup trophy back to its spiritual home.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nBrazil 2-0 Serbia\n\nBrazil 1-0 Switzerland\n\nCameroon 1-0 Brazil\n\nRound of 16:\n\nBrazil 4-1 South Korea\n\nNetherlands vs. Argentina\n\nWhen: Friday, December 9, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Lusail Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, the Netherlands has a 8.96% chance of winning the World Cup. Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n\nNetherlands\n\nIn what is expected to be the last tournament of Louis van Gaal’s stellar career, the Netherlands manager is looking to replicate his 2010 accomplishment of reaching the final of the World Cup – and maybe going one step further this time.\n\nLacking the stars of 2014, the Dutch have been a far more practical side, only conceding two goals so far in the tournament. But that did not stop it from scoring one of the goals of the tournament against the US. The team strung 20 passes together in a picturesque advertisement of the beautiful game before Memphis Depay stroked the ball home.\n\nThe Netherlands had arguably the easiest path to the quarterfinal stage, and their resilience will be tested as they play a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nSenegal 0-2 Netherlands\n\nNetherlands 1-1 Ecuador\n\nNetherlands 2-0 Qatar\n\nRound of 16:\n\nNetherlands 3-1 United States\n\nAccording to Opta, Argentina has a 17.4% chance of winning the World Cup. Molly Darlington/Reuters\n\nArgentina\n\nIn its first game of the tournament, Argentina suffered arguably the biggest upset in World Cup history as Messi and co. lost to Saudi Arabia. But since then, La Albiceleste has kicked into gear, comfortably winning its last three games.\n\nIn what is likely his final World Cup, Messi has slowly grown into the tournament, but against Australia he showed glimpses of why he is widely considered to be the best to grace the game. He scored a trademark goal against Australia, curling home a finish with irresistible ease, and was at his creative best as time and time again he created chances for his teammates.\n\nThis is arguably the least glamorous Argentina squad of the 21st century, but Lionel Scaloni’s side has a functional system that has served the team well. Like the Netherlands, Argentina is facing its biggest test of the tournament.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nArgentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia\n\nArgentina 2-0 Mexico\n\nPoland 0-2 Argentina\n\nRound of 16:\n\nArgentina 2-1 Australia Cup\n\nEngland vs. France\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Bayt Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, England has a 18.83% chance of winning the World Cup. Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEngland\n\nThe Three Lions have had the best start of any team in Qatar, keeping three clean sheets and dispatching African champion Senegal with ease in the last 16. Which begs the question: is this the best England team since 1966, when it last won thee World?\n\nUnder Gareth Southgate, England has become a tournament specialist, playing functional football and restricting its abundance of attacking talent in favor of defensive solidity. But against Senegal, fans were treated to a glimpse of what this England attack can do when given the space and opportunity.\n\nWith the addition of Jude Bellingham to the midfield, England is now playing like one of the best teams in the world, adding goals to a staunch defense. The one criticism of arguably England’s best ever manager is that Southgate struggles against superior opponents. There is no greater test of that theory than facing France in the quarterfinals.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nEngland 6-2 Iran\n\nEngland 0-0 United States\n\nWales 0-3 England\n\nRound of 16:\n\nEngland 3-0 Senegal\n\nAccording to Opta, France has a 14.74% chance of winning the World Cup. Ebrahim Noroozi/AP\n\nFrance\n\nAfter a shaky first half against Australia, the French have quickly dispelled any of the pre-tournament concerns that they would follow the previous three World Cup champions and make a group-stage exit.\n\nLes Bleus have looked irresistible at times, and bar their second-string team losing a dead rubber to Tunisia, the team looks every bit as good as the one that dominated Russia in 2018. Olivier Giroud has become France’s all-time top scorer, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Adrien Rabiot have filled the Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté shaped hole in midfield, and forward Antione Griezmann looks back to his best.\n\nBut this team is all about one man: Kylian Mbappé. The PSG forward has looked irresistible and the best player at the tournament. Whether he is sitting defenders down, or curling in stunning goals, it looks like no one on the planet has the tools to cope with the mercurial talent.\n\nFrance faces its neighbor from across the Channel next, but for England to pass into the semifinals, it will have to find a way to stop the world’s best player.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nFrance 4-1 Australia\n\nFrance 2-1 Denmark\n\nTunisia 1-0 France\n\nRound of 16:\n\nFrance 3-1 Poland\n\nMorocco vs. Portugal\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 10 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Thumama Stadium\n\nMorocco\n\nThis Morocco team has been a revelation this tournament, defending valiantly and attacking with verve and is more than deserving of its place in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Achraf Hakimi, who scored an audacious ‘Panenka’ to win the penalty shootout against Spain, Morocco boasts a bonafide superstar and the Paris Saint-Germain fullback’s boundless energy down the right flank is the Atlas Lions’ greatest attacking threat.\n\nChelsea winger Hakim Ziyech provides Morocco’s creative spark, while Fioretina’s Sofyan Amrabat has undoubtedly been one of the best midfielders so far in this World Cup.\n\nHead coach Walid Regragui has instilled incredible belief and organization into his team and Morocco will justifiably feel confident it can beat Portgual and become the first African team in history to reach a World Cup semifinal.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nBelgium 0-2 Morocco\n\nCanada 1-2 Morocco\n\nRound of 16:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Spain (Morocco wins 3-0 on penalties)\n\nGonçalo Ramos scored a brilliant hat-trick against Switzerland as he spearheaded a scintillating Portugal performance. Justin Setterfield/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nPortugal\n\nA loss in its final group game against South Korea raised questions about Portugal’s ability to progress far into this year’s World Cup, but its demolition of Switzerland in the last 16 answered them with aplomb. Fernando Santos’ side looked unstoppable with 21-year-old striker Gonçalo Ramos bursting onto the world stage with a brilliant hat-trick.\n\nThe youngster was replacing Cristiano Ronaldo, who was dropped to the bench for the crunch tie. It’s not yet clear whether the superstar striker will be installed back into the starting lineup for its quarterfinal tie, but Portugal certainly didn’t miss him on Tuesday.\n\nPortugal faces a potentially tricky opposition, which has already beaten Belgium and Spain at Qatar 2022.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nPortugal 3-2 Ghana\n\nPortugal 2-0 Uruguay\n\nSouth Korea 2-1 Portugal\n\nRound of 16:\n\nPortugal 6-1 Switzerland", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/football/kylian-mbappe-best-player-qatar-2022-messi-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Kylian Mbappé: Why the 'unstoppable' star now wears the crown as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt just 23, Kylian Mbappé has won more in his short career than most players are ever able to achieve.\n\nHe’s already claimed five domestic titles in France, scored 250 career goals and, four years ago, lifted the World Cup trophy.\n\nDespite already proving he belongs among the elite, Mbappé has continued to improve season upon season and this year’s World Cup arguably feels like the moment he steps out alone as the best player in the world.\n\nIt’s a title that doesn’t come without dispute, though.\n\nWhile an aging Cristiano Ronaldo can no longer stake a claim, Mbappé’s Paris Saint-Germain teammate Lionel Messi – who has won seven Ballon d’Or awards – has produced some mesmeric performances for Argentina in Qatar. And let’s not forget players such as Erling Haaland, who failed to qualify for the tournament with Norway, but who promises to challenge Mbappé for accolades.\n\nBut, with this being Messi’s final World Cup, former France international and current Bordeaux coach Rio Mavuba says this tournament has seen the baton of greatness passed onto Mbappé.\n\n“In this World Cup, it’s been the transfer of power from Messi to Mbappé,” he told CNN, ahead of the pair’s showdown in the World Cup final on Sunday.\n\n“Messi is still one of the greatest, maybe the best player of all time, but, at this point, Mbappé can eat at the same table as Messi.\n\n“When he’s focused, he’s probably the best player in the world.”\n\nMessi and Mbappé both play for French club Paris-Saint Germain. GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMavuba made 13 appearances for France and was included in Didier Deschamps’ squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\nHe’s watched from afar as a young Mbappé has matured quickly into France’s most important player and says the attacker’s pace and finishing prowess makes him “unstoppable” at times.\n\nMbappé was born and raised in Bondy, a suburb of Paris 11 kilometers from the city center and, aside from a two-year spell playing for Monaco, has lived in the French capital his entire life.\n\nHis spell at Monaco, where he won his first league title, caught the world’s attention and the teenage sensation moved to PSG in 2017, initially on loan for the first year.\n\nThe deal was reported to be worth $214 million but Mbappé seemed to take it all in his stride.\n\nDespite all the trophies he’s won and goals he’s scored, Mavuba says the forward is only now coming into his prime.\n\n“For sure, he’s got a lot of speed but I think the best skill is he can do a lot of things. He can run fast, he can dribble, he can score, this is why it’s very difficult to catch him,” he said.\n\n‘He’s been gifted’\n\nWhile Mbappé’s physical attributes are undeniable, it’s his ability to cope with such intense pressure that separates him from the others, according to former Paris Saint-Germain captain Didier Domi.\n\nDomi, who played over 100 games for PSG and who now works for the club’s academy in Qatar, says Mbappé holds the weight of a nation on his shoulders but it seems his value reaches beyond just his performances on the pitch, and into the political arena.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron intervened earlier this year to implore the young star to stay at PSG amid a transfer saga involving Spanish giant Real Madrid.\n\nBut despite all the pressure that comes both on and off the field, Mbappé continues to produce the goods.\n\n“His game is so unbelievable but the way he lifts the team, this is what has impressed me the most, mentally,” Domi told CNN.\n\n“We know his qualities with his feet but mentally he’s staying in that zone, as a leader, always being crucial for the team. It’s impressive.\n\n“He’s got a talent, of course, but he’s got a talent in his head as well. He controls his nerves and that’s part of the game.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, he doesn’t feel pressure. He’s been gifted.”\n\nMbappé has torn defenses apart with his pace at Qatar 2022. Francois Nel/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhile Mbappé has likely over a decade left to play at the top level, Qatar 2022 also marks the end of arguably the greatest rivalry in football history – with it being the last time we see Ronaldo and Messi play at a World Cup.\n\nBut as that chapter closes, Mbappé has the chance to take center stage.\n\n“He [Mbappé] will be the legacy of Messi and Ronaldo, maybe he’s already the best player in the world,” Domi added.\n\n“He doesn’t have the vision of Messi but, at his best, Mbappé is the best player in the world. He can make a difference at every moment.”\n\nBetter than Zidane?\n\nMbappé has scored five goals in Qatar – level as top goalscorer with Messi – bringing his World Cup total to nine from just two tournaments.\n\nJust Fontaine is the only Frenchman to score more World Cup goals – netting all 13 of his efforts in 1958.\n\nMore importantly, Mbappé is on the verge of winning his second successive World Cup, something that would make him potentially the greatest French player in history, according to Mavuba.\n\n“If he won the second World Cup, he’d probably be the best French player,” Mavuba said.\n\n“I love [Zinedine] Zidane but imagine, 23 years old, two World Cups, he’d be the best.”\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

For 45 minutes, the Blues were poor, but two quick goals by Kai Havertz helped them to a 4-0 victory. Throughout the match, Chelsea fans chanted the name Roman Abramovich – even during a minute of applause to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people. The manager, Thomas Tuchel, was visibly displeased. This was not “the moment to do this”, he said. Abramovich reportedly tried to sell the club for an asking price of £3bn, said Duncan Castles in The Sunday Times. It seems an astronomically high sum, given that Chelsea is a club with “inferior revenue streams” to Manchester United, which is thought to be worth about £1.5bn. Another huge issue is Stamford Bridge, which is in need of costly redevelopment, said Matt Law in The Daily Telegraph: it makes the real cost of a purchase even more expensive. On Thursday, the situation changed drastically when sanctions were imposed on Abramovich by the UK government. Russian-born billionaire Abramovich is one of seven more oligarchs who have had sanctions placed on them in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sky News reported. A government document said Abramovich has had a “close relationship for decades” with Russian President Vladimir Putin. How will sanctions impact Chelsea and a potential sale? As a result of the sanctions, the club’s income has been frozen. It is under an effective transfer embargo and it cannot even sell tickets to matches. The future of the reigning European champions is “uncertain”, the BBC said. But a special licence allows the Stamford Bridge club to keep operating. The men’s and women’s teams can fulfil their fixtures for the rest of this season as normal and the licence allows wages to be paid to all employees, including players and coaching staff. Skip advert Abramovich can “no longer press ahead with selling the club”, said the Daily Mail. However, Chelsea can request “special dispensation”, which would be considered if the government views a change of ownership in the “best interests of the club”, provided it does not benefit Abramovich. “It effectively leaves Abramovich with two options: agree to the government’s conditions and lose the club for nothing, or let Chelsea slowly rot.”\n\nChelsea fan and British property tycoon Nick Candy has confirmed that he remains interested in buying the club, the Mail reported. “We are examining the details of the announcement and we are still interested in making a bid,” a spokesperson said. “Clearly this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view no one is the owner of a football club – you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.” It’s not just Candy who is interested in buying Chelsea, The Daily Telegraph reported. New York-based merchant bank Raine, which is handling the sale, has received around 150 inquiries from individuals or groups claiming to be interested. The sanctioning of Abramovich is set to “spark a shootout” between three American-led groups who are bidding to “save Chelsea from the threat of financial armageddon”. What about the sponsors? Following Thursday’s developments, Chelsea could “lose millions” in sponsorship revenue, the Mail said. Telecoms firm Three has put its £40m shirt sponsorship on hold while fellow partners Hyundai, Parimatch and Zapp are also considering ending their agreements. A Three spokesperson said it had asked Chelsea to “temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice”. The “off-field chaos” continued on Friday with “further news of unrest”, The Independent reported. Kit supplier Nike may also follow main sponsor Three in suspending its deal with the club. Nike agreed a 15-year, £900m deal with Chelsea in 2016 and should they walk away it would see the club miss out on £540m. Could the Nike deal be the “nail in Chelsea’s coffin?”, the Mail asked. A club in turmoil – but Tuchel is holding it together Chelsea are facing the “harsh reality of life after Abramovich”, said Miguel Delaney in The Independent. “The sanctions against the owner not only impact the here and now of the football club but its future too.” Skip advert Away from the financial woes there were positive results on the pitch for Chelsea’s senior teams on Thursday night. The men’s side beat Norwich 3-1 in the Premier League while the women’s team were 4-1 winners at West Ham in the WSL. This may be “the crumbling of the Roman Empire”, but someone forgot to tell Chelsea manager Tuchel, James Robson said in the Evening Standard. Amid the “chaos, trauma and uncertainty”, the German is the man “holding it together in the eye of the storm”. Tuchel has emerged as the figurehead of a club that is in “desperate need of leadership”. The glory years at Stamford Bridge Since Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, they have won “every trophy available”, Planet Football said. Before his ownership, the Blues had won “just one top-flight title and five domestic cups in the 98 years before his arrival”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}]}

More specifically, research showed that most heart attacks hit around 10 p.m. that day.\n\nThe observational study analyzed the timing of 283,014 heart attacks reported to the Swedish coronary care unit registry between 1998 to 2013. Findings were published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ.\n\nIn Sweden, Christmas Eve is the main time for celebrating the holiday as people are most likely to see family, drink and eat together.\n\nOther days related to a higher risk of heart attack: Midsummer, a Swedish holiday in mid-June where businesses close and families come together, and New Year's Day.

They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron’s BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n“If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it’s really, really rare,” Al-Aly said. That’s not true anymore, though.\n\n“So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you’re on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.”\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded – meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that’s not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n“There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you’re getting it again, maybe it doesn’t affect you that much, but that’s not really true,” he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn’t get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren’t, either.\n\n“It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,” Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n“The most relevant question to people’s lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,” he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can’t determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person’s underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n“There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‘if I survived my first infection, that I’m really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn’t be any problem,’ ” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n“The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,” Griffin said of the study on the podcast “This Week in Virology.” But that’s not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it’s supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift – as influenza does – our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n“A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,” Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he’s seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it’s not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he’s seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n“We don’t really see much of that with the flu,” Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn’t mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you’re at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it’s a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n“People don’t want to hear it, but that’s the reality.

The research is in the final draft stages and has not been submitted for publication in a medical journal.\n\nResearchers used nearly 150,000 chest X-rays to train an artificial intelligence program to identify patterns in the images associated with risk from major cardiovascular disease events. They tested the program on a separate group of about 11,000 people and found “significant association” between the risk level predicted by the AI and the actual occurrence of a major cardiovascular disease event.\n\nThe clinical standard for analyzing risk from cardiovascular disease is the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, a calculator that weights various patient data points that have been found to have a high association with adverse cardiovascular events, including age, blood pressure and history of smoking.\n\nStatin medication is recommended for people with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or higher. The AI model uses the same risk thresholds as the established risk calculator, and early findings suggest that it works just as well.\n\n“We’ve long recognized that X-rays capture information beyond traditional diagnostic findings, but we haven’t used this data because we haven’t had robust, reliable methods,” said Dr. Jakob Weiss, the lead researcher and a radiologist affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital and the AI in Medicine program at Harvard Medical School’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\nSometimes, the AI findings align with a traditional radiology reading, but other times, it picks up on things that may have been missed, he said.\n\n“Part of it is anatomical alterations that we would also pick up with our naked eye and that make physiological sense. Let’s say there’s increased blood pressure or cardiac failure – these are findings that we can pick up in a normal chest radiograph as well. But I think a lot of the information captured or extracted is somewhere embedded in the scan, but we can’t make sense of it as traditionally trained radiologists as of now,” Weiss said.\n\n“It has this black box character to it,” he said, which can sometimes make it hard to communicate risk to patients without an explanation to pinpoint.\n\nDr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and former president of the American Heart Association, was co-chair of the risk assessment panel when the ASCVD risk calculator was created in 2013 and a key player in 2018 when the guidelines were updated to emphasize the relationship between the risk score and personal medical history.\n\nHe was not involved in the new AI research but says it’s important to keep the field moving forward.\n\n“This is exactly the kind of application that artificial intelligence is best for,” he said. “So we need to continue to do things like this to really understand if we can find, particularly, patients who would otherwise slip through the cracks. I think that’s where it may be most useful.”\n\nBut collecting all of the patient data points that go into the established risk calculator is still critical – because they’re actionable. And whether risk is calculated using a statistical formula or an AI model, the most successful outcomes will still require personalized patient assessments.\n\n“We don’t cure smoking by a chest X-ray. We actually need to work with the patient to find ways to get them to stop smoking,” Lloyd-Jones said. “The risk calculator is one part of risk assessment, but it’s not the only part. It’s a process that involves both the patient and the doctor in a discussion about what is the patient’s risk and how much we think a statin would help them.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor their research, Weiss and co-authors trained the AI using chest X-rays from participants in the National Cancer Institute’s Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for?

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/health/coffee-live-longer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Coffee lowers risk of heart problems and early death, study says ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDrinking two to three cups a day of most types of coffee may protect you from cardiovascular disease and an early death, a new study found.\n\n“The results suggest that mild to moderate intake of ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee should be considered part of a healthy lifestyle,” said study author Peter Kistler, head of clinical electrophysiology research at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute and head of electrophysiology at Alfred Hospital in Melbourne.\n\nResearchers found “significant reductions” in the risk for coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and stroke for all three types of coffee. However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say.

Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/health/adhd-autism-early-death-risk-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "People with autism or ADHD are more likely to die early, review says", "text": "CNN —\n\nHaving autism or ADHD could come with a higher risk of dying earlier than normal, according to new research.\n\nSeveral previous studies have suggested these neurodevelopmental disorders might be linked with a higher risk of premature death, but findings were inconsistent, according to a new meta-analysis, or review of data from many previous studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

Barkley and Geraldine Dawson – who weren’t involved in the research – also highlighted how preventive health care can make a difference.\n\n“After all, ELE (estimated life expectancy) is malleable,” wrote Barkley and Dawson, a former clinical professor of psychiatry at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and the William Cleland Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University, respectively. “Change the adverse health and lifestyle factors affecting it, and one can improve quality of life, as well as life expectancy.”\n\nPeople with autism or ADHD “frequently die of preventable natural causes,” they also wrote. “This knowledge demands widespread recognition and the implementation of systematic screening and preventive approaches.”\n\nFactors raising early death rate\n\nThe authors of the meta-analysis didn’t have details on participants’ lifestyles, socioeconomic factors or specific causes of death. But prior research has highlighted several factors that could explain the higher early death rate among children and young people with autism or ADHD, the authors wrote.\n\nAround 1% of people worldwide have autism, while roughly 5% of people have ADHD, according to the Autism Society and World Health Organization surveys, respectively. People with ADHD or autism have been found to be at higher risk for coexisting mental disorders and neurological conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance misuse or abuse, eating disorders, epilepsy, or conduct or tic disorders.\n\nThese groups have also been linked with higher rates of obesity; dental trauma or decay; sedentary behavior or low exercise participation; sleeping problems; migraines; heart disease; and less involvement in preventive practices concerning health, nutrition and dental hygiene, Barkley and Dawson wrote.\n\nImpulsive or inattentive behaviors that are characteristic of these disorders can be contributing factors for injuries and unintentional incidents, according to the meta-analysis.\n\nThe editorial’s authors suggested that early mortality could explain something that has stumped clinical researchers for decades: the decline in the prevalence of ADHD with age. About 5% to 8% of children might meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD while that figure falls to up to 5% of adults and nearly 3% of older adults.\n\nSome researchers have thought this declining prevalence might be due to people experiencing fewer ADHD symptoms as they age or not getting rediagnosed. But the findings “make plain that another explanation is the greater loss of individuals with these conditions from the population over time owing to heightened mortality compared with typical peers,” Barkley and Dawson wrote.\n\nWhat people with autism or ADHD need\n\nAddressing the issue of premature mortality in people with ADHD and autism is challenging and starts with health care providers, both the meta-analysis and editorial authors said.\n\n“Clinicians and health care professionals can be encouraged to routinely collect information on behavioral, medical conditions and health outcomes related to ASD (autism spectrum disorder)/ADHD, emphasizing the need to recognize and address modifiable vulnerability factors and prevent delays in health care provision,” the meta-analysis authors wrote.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“This approach is imperative for individuals with ADHD (or ASD) as the higher risk for mortality reported in this review could be reduced by doing so,” according to Barkley and Dawson’s editorial.\n\nSome organizations have resources for how children and adults with autism or ADHD can increase their chances of doing things that could help their quality of life or life expectancy, including exercise, dental care and sleep.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/health/statin-stroke-study/index.html", "title": "Statins lower the risk of one of the deadliest kinds of strokes, study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDoctors know that drugs called statins lower a person’s risk of a stroke due to a blood clot. But a new study shows that the inexpensive medications can also decrease the risk of a first stroke as a result of an intracerebral hemorrhage, the deadliest kind.\n\nAn intracerebral hemorrhage is when blood from an artery suddenly begins to bleed into the brain. It’s the second most common cause of a stroke after a blood clot, which is called an ischemic stroke.\n\nStroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Many can be prevented through lifestyle changes such as eating healthy, getting exercise and quitting smoking.\n\nStatins are another powerful tool for stroke prevention. They work by reducing fatty deposits in the arteries and keeping them from building up to cut off blood to the brain. Globally, hundreds of millions of people take them to prevent heart problems or stroke.\n\nThere has been conflicting research on whether a statin can reduce a person’s risk of a first intracerebral hemorrhage. The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, seems to put a cap on some of that debate.\n\nThe researchers used prescription data and the health records of more than 88,000 people in Denmark who did not have a history of stroke. During the study period, 989 people (with an average age of 76) had a first bleeding stroke in the lobe area of the brain, and 1,175 (with an average age of 75) had one in the other parts of the brain.\n\nThe researchers distinguished between lobar vs. nonlobar strokes so they could look for differences in strokes in different parts of the brain; nonlobar strokes are often caused by high blood pressure.\n\nThe research was partially funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk makes drugs for the treatment of stroke, but the foundation was not involved in the study design or interpretation of the data, the researchers say.\n\nPeople in the study who used statins for any period of time had a 17% lower risk of a stroke in the lobe areas of the brain and a 16% lower risk of a stroke in the non-lobe areas of the brain. When they used a statin for more than five years, they had a 33% lower risk of a bleeding stroke in the lobe areas and a 38% lower risk in the non-lobe areas.\n\n“It’s reassuring news for people taking statins that these medications seem to reduce the risk of bleeding stroke as well as the risk of stroke from blood clots,” said study co-author Dr. David Gaist, a professor of the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.\n\nThe study has some limitations, however. It lacked data on potentially important underlying conditions that could lead to a stroke and other information about behaviors that could raise a person’s risk, such as smoking or alcohol use. There would also need to be additional research to determine whether the results would be the same in non-European populations.\n\nA large ongoing trial funded by the US National Institutes of Health is trying to determine whether people who have been on statins and are admitted to a hospital with a hemorrhagic stroke should keep using the drug or stop taking it.\n\nSome research has suggested that people who have a history of stroke due to a blood clot, called an ischemic stroke, may have a higher risk of a hemorrhagic stroke if they take a statin.\n\n“There were these small exploratory studies off of randomized trials that suggested the possibility there was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke if there had been a history of ischemic stroke. So that’s thrown us off a bit,” said Dr. Pooja Khatri, a professor and division chief of neurology and rehabilitation medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. She works regularly with people who have had strokes and was not involved in the new research.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe said this study shows what biologically makes sense: Taking statins and keeping fatty deposits from building up in the arteries makes hemorrhagic strokes less likely.\n\n“Studies like this latest one sort of put the nail in the coffin because they’re larger and they’re so comprehensive and population-based. This study tells me that if a patient has never had a stroke and they have indications, a statin is definitely a good idea,” Khatri said. “It makes us think that we are right to be certain that overall, patients are better off on statins.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/health/night-owl-disease-risk-sleep-late-wellness/index.html", "title": "Night owls have higher risk of diabetes, heart disease, study says ...", "text": "Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you prefer to go to bed and get up later – a sleep chronotype known as being a night owl – you may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease, a new study found.\n\nNight owls were more sedentary, had lower aerobic fitness levels and burned less fat at rest and while active than early birds in the study. Night owls were also more likely to be insulin-resistant, meaning their muscles required more insulin to be able to get the energy they need, according to the study published Monday in the journal Experimental Physiology.\n\n“Insulin tells the muscles to be a sponge and absorb the glucose in the blood,” said senior study author Steven Malin, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\n“Think about it like water from a water faucet: You turn the water on and a drop touches the sponge and is immediately absorbed,” Malin said. “But if you’re not exercising, engaging those muscles, it’s like if that sponge was to sit for a couple days and get rock hard. A drop of water isn’t going to make it soft again.”\n\nIf sleep chronotype is affecting how our bodies use insulin and impacting metabolism, then being a night owl might be useful in predicting a person’s risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, Malin added.\n\n“The study adds to what we know,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved with the research.\n\n“There is good evidence that being a late sleeper has been linked to a higher risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease,” said Zee, who is also a professor of neurology. “Several mechanisms have been proposed: sleep loss, circadian misalignment, eating later in the day and being exposed to less morning light and more evening light, which have all been shown to affect insulin sensitivity.”\n\nBody clock and chronotype\n\nAll humans have a circadian rhythm – an internal 24-hour body clock that regulates the release of the hormone melatonin to promote sleep and ceases production so that we wake. Our body clock also directs when we get hungry, when we feel most sluggish, and when we feel peppy enough to exercise, among many other bodily functions.\n\nBeing a night owl may result in lower activity levels during the day, the study found. PR Image Factory/Adobe Stock\n\nTraditionally, sunrise and nightfall regulated the human sleep-wake cycle. Daylight enters the eyes, travels to the brain and sets off a signal that suppresses melatonin production. When the sun goes down, the body clock turns melatonin production back on, and a few hours later sleep arrives.\n\nYour personal sleep chronotype, thought to be inherited, may alter that natural rhythm. If you’re an innate early bird, your circadian rhythm releases melatonin much earlier than the norm, energizing you to become most active in the morning. In night owls, however, the internal body clock secretes melatonin much later, making early mornings sluggish and pushing peak activity and alertness later into the afternoon and evening.\n\nSleep chronotype can have profound effects on productivity, school performance, social functioning and lifestyle habits, experts say. Early birds tend to perform better in school, and are more active throughout the day, which may partly explain why studies have found they have less risk of cardiovascular disease, Malin said.\n\nEvening types may take more risks, use more tobacco, alcohol and caffeine, and are more likely to skip breakfast and eat more later in the day. In addition, research suggests “later cronotypes have higher body fat located more in the stomach or abdominal region, an area which many health professionals believe to be worse for our health,” Malin said.\n\nFat or carbs?\n\nResearchers classified 51 adults without heart disease or diabetes into morning or evening chronotypes, based on their natural sleep and wake preferences. During the study, the participants ate a controlled diet and fasted overnight while their activity levels were monitored for a week.\n\nThe research team determined each person’s body mass, body composition and fitness level, and measured levels of insulin sensitivity. In addition, researchers looked at how each person’s metabolism obtained most of their energy, either via fat or carbohydrates.\n\n“Fat metabolism is important because we think if you can burn fat for energy that’s going to help the muscle pick up the glucose in a more enduring fashion,” Malin said.\n\nBurning fat can promote endurance and more physical and mental activity throughout the day. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are what the body uses for intense physical activity. Carbs are burned more quickly, which is why many athletes carb-load in advance of a race or marathon.\n\nResults of the test showed early birds used more fat for energy at both rest and during exercise than night owls in the study, who used more carbohydrates as a source of fuel.\n\nThere is a need for more research, Malin said, to confirm the findings and determine if the metabolic differences are due to the chronotype or a potential misalignment between a night owl’s natural preference and the need to wake early due to the hours set by society for work and school.\n\nPeople who are continuously out of synch with their innate body clock are said to be in “social jet lag.”\n\n“This extends beyond just diabetes or just heart disease,” Malin said. “It may point to a bigger societal issue. How are we helping people who may be in misalignment? Are we as a society forcing people to behave in ways that might actually be putting them at risk?", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/health/covid-alzheimers-diagnosis-wellness/index.html", "title": "New Alzheimer's diagnoses more common among seniors who ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA recent study of more than 6 million people 65 and older found that seniors who had Covid-19 had a substantially higher risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease within a year.\n\nThe study does not show that Covid-19 causes Alzheimer’s, but it adds to the growing body of research drawing links between coronavirus infection and cognitive function.\n\n“​​In the Alzheimer’s disease brain, the pathology starts to build up about 20 years before the symptoms begin,” said Dr. David Holtzman, a neurologist who leads a research lab focused on Alzheimer’s disease at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. People would have to be followed for decades after a Covid-19 infection to prove it as a cause, he said.\n\nInstead, a Covid-19 infection could cause inflammation that may exacerbate changes that are already happening in the brain, experts say.\n\n“The brain has its own immune response to the pathology that’s involved in [Alzheimer’s] disease progressing,” said Holtzman, who was not part of the new study. “When there are other things that cause inflammation that are in the body that can affect the brain, likely what happens is that can even amplify the process that’s already going on.”\n\nOther viruses can cause similar inflammation, experts say.\n\nCovid “is another one of the many dozen potential risk factors that I talked about with my patients,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist and director of Florida Atlantic Unviersity’s Center for Brain Health.

And it’s an “extremely important problem” to watch, given the scale of disease.\n\n“Imagine how many millions of people over the age of 60 or 65, like myself, have had Covid.

Here's why | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUS natural gas prices have skyrocketed to levels unseen since 2008, a spike that threatens to offset the benefits of falling prices at the gas pump.\n\nNatural gas futures surged 7% on Tuesday to close at $9.33 per million British thermal unit (BTU), the highest closing price since August 1, 2008.\n\nAlthough natural gas futures cooled off a touch on Wednesday, they remain up about 70% just since the end of June. And natural gas is up a staggering 525% since closing at $1.48 in June 2020 when Covid-19 had shut much of the US economy down.\n\nThe summer spike is being driven in part by high demand as scorching temperatures through much of the country force Americans to crank up the air conditioning. That in turn has chipped away at relatively low inventory levels.\n\n“We’ve had this perma-heat wave cooking the United States,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities.\n\nAs temperatures drop this fall and winter, the natural gas spike signals sticker shock for families. Not only is natural gas a leading fuel source for the electric grid, it’s the most popular way to heat homes in America.\n\n“Depending on the weather, it could be a challenging winter,” said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors. “But not as challenging as in Europe. They are at risk of running out of natural gas. We aren’t.”\n\nEurope’s natural gas prices are seven times higher\n\nEurope’s natural gas crisis is being driven by its reliance on energy from Russia, which has slashed natural gas flows to Europe in response to Western sanctions.\n\nThe European Union has been forced to lay plans to ration natural gas, a drastic step that will hurt families and businesses. Natural gas prices have skyrocketed so high in Europe that it threatens to send the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nFor context, Europe’s natural gas prices are trading at levels equivalent to about $70 per million BTUs, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. That is roughly seven times higher than prices in the United States.\n\nBut that is little consolation to Americans grappling with high prices at the grocery store, clothing stores and at restaurants.\n\nEven as natural gas prices surge, oil prices have tumbled, helping to drive gasoline prices sharply lower. The national average for regular gasoline has dropped 64 days in a row, according to AAA.\n\nExports pick-up to Europe\n\nAnalysts say Europe’s natural gas crisis is contributing to the higher natural gas prices in America, although it’s not the main driver.\n\n“Higher global prices are trickling down to the US. Natural gas has become a global commodity with the emergency of LNG,” said Thummel.\n\nThe United States has stepped up its exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in an effort to mitigate the impact of the loss of Russian gas.\n\n“Every spare molecule we can find, we are shipping to the eurozone,” said Yawger.\n\nUS natural gas production is lagging behind\n\nBut the bigger issue for US natural gas is the fact that inventory levels are below historical averages, leaving the market with less of a buffer and driving up prices.\n\n“We entered this year at beaten-down levels and we never caught up,” Yawger said.\n\nSupply has failed to keep up with strong demand for gas. Thummel pointed to how US oil and gas producers are under pressure from Wall Street to spend less on expensive drilling projects and more on dividends and buybacks to shareholders.\n\n“We need more US natural gas production. The production levels are too low,” Thummel said.\n\nThe good news is that higher prices should, eventually, incentivize more production. And investors are not betting today’s high prices will continue. The futures market indicates natural gas prices should be almost 50% lower at this point next year.\n\nThen again, very few people thought a year ago natural gas prices would be at 2008 levels.

CNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince early in the pandemic, China has used health codes on mobile phones to track individuals’ health statuses. The color of these codes – in red, amber or green – decides whether users can leave their homes, use public transport and enter public places, or potentially need to quarantine.\n\nUnder the guidelines released Wednesday, people will be able to enter most places without showing a negative test result or their health code – a significant step after nearly three years of disruption to people’s daily routines and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a few exceptions will still require these checks, including nursing homes, medical institutions and secondary schools. Businesses can now determine their own prevention and control policies, the report added.\n\nHome quarantine allowed\n\nIn another massive change, asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms will be allowed to quarantine at home instead of being taken to a government facility, unless they choose otherwise.\n\nPatients whose condition deteriorates will be transferred to hospital for treatment, the report said. Close contacts can also quarantine at home.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Chinese residents have described the chaos and stress of going into quarantine camps, many saying it was unclear when they would be allowed to leave, and others complaining of crowded or poor conditions.\n\nIn several cases, health workers reportedly killed the pets of those taken to government quarantine, citing health risks – triggering outrage on Chinese social media each time. Others criticized the policy after reports earlier this year of elderly residents being forced out of their homes in the middle of the night for transport to quarantine.\n\nMan dragged out of home after allegedly refusing to go to quarantine facility 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nLimits on lockdown\n\nThe new guidelines also urge authorities to “ensure the normal functioning of society and basic medical services,” saying areas that aren’t designated high-risk should not restrict people’s movements or close businesses.\n\nLockdowns are only allowed in “high-risk areas,” and even then, should be “promptly” lifted if no new cases are found for five consecutive days, it said. It added that authorities are forbidden from blocking fire escapes, apartment or building entrances, and other gates, so residents can still evacuate and seek medical attention if needed.\n\nThis particular guideline comes at a particularly sensitive time, with China still reeling from a wave of rare public protest in late November and early December, that had been triggered by a deadly fire in the far western Xinjiang region. Public fury had swept the nation after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nDuring the protests, thousands across the country took to the streets to call for an end to lockdowns and other zero-Covid measures – with some voicing broader grievances against censorship and the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership.\n\n'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\nVaccination plan\n\nThe State Council on Wednesday also emphasized the need to accelerate Covid vaccination among the elderly, saying all locations should be “administrating as many vaccinations as possible.”\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, experts say even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion.\n\nMore than 86% of China’s population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission. That leaves around 25 million who have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and November 28 vaccination data. But booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated, but only 40% had received booster shots as of November 11, according to state media.\n\nDomestic travel\n\nThe rules also make domestic travel within China easier, with cross-regional travelers no longer needing to provide a negative test result or their health code – or test upon arrival.\n\nThese former requirements, as well as other travel restrictions such as provincial border closures and provincial train and bus suspensions, have made domestic travel difficult over the last few years.\n\nFor the many in China who left their hometowns to find work in other cities and provinces, that meant being separated from family for long stretches – or being stranded far from home without an income during snap lockdowns.\n\nResidents line up for Covid tests in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, some social media users have pointed out that Lunar New Year is just a month away – the country’s biggest annual holiday, a time when people typically travel home to gather with family, akin to the American Thanksgiving.\n\nFor some, the prospect of mass nationwide travel has raised concern of the virus spreading once more. Others, long fatigued with the toll of zero-Covid, greeted the news with relief.\n\n“I haven’t been home for Chinese New Year for two years now, I’m crying,” one person said on Weibo. Another wrote: “It’s been a long time. Welcome home.”\n\nMedicine, schools, and monitoring\n\nA few other guidelines are also likely to ease the transition away from zero-Covid toward a less disruptive model.\n\nFor instance, schools without Covid outbreaks are now asked to carry out “normal offline teaching activities,” and to reopen on-campus facilities such as cafeterias, libraries and sports venues. Schools with Covid cases can continue “normal teaching and living,” as long as they designate certain “risk areas” with control measures.\n\nThe guidelines also emphasize the need to make medicine widely accessible, dropping restrictions that previously made it difficult to buy cold and fever medication in pharmacies. Since early in the pandemic, China has required a prescription and negative Covid test to buy these.\n\nPerhaps reflecting public concern that the relaxation in rules could cause a surge in cases, residents have rushed to drug stores, with reports last week that cold and fever medicines were flying off shelves.\n\nThe State Council also urged doctors and local medical institutions to continue closely monitoring the health situation of key populations, including the risks posed to elderly or immunocompromised residents.\n\nSome experts have warned that a broader reopening inevitably brings health risks, especially to those vulnerable groups.\n\n“The key risk when countries decide to move away from a zero-Covid policy is really the strain this will exert on the health care system,” said Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director for the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/economy/retail-sales-july-inflation/index.html", "title": "US consumers continue to spend, but rising inflation has shifted their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith lower gas prices effectively putting more money back in their pockets, Americans continued to spend last month.

Retail sales at department stores, for example, dropped in the month of July and were also lower on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEven wealthier Americans are being impacted by the highest inflation in 40 years: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday on the company’s investor call that higher prices were contributing to an influx of higher-income shoppers at the discount store.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make,” McMillon said.\n\nHigher prices on food and gas impact lower-income households to a greater degree, because they must spend a larger share of their earnings for these necessary purchases, said Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank.\n\n“It’s kind of a double whammy – you have less coming in, more going out. It really makes for challenging times,” he said, noting that the amount of debt people are carrying on their credit cards has been creeping up. The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that consumers added $40.1 billion worth of debt to their balance sheets in June.\n\nThe July data also showed that sales at home improvement stores rose by 1.5% over the month and by 10.1% from a year ago – as corroborated by recent earnings in this sector. Home Depot said Tuesday it had record sales in the most recent quarter, and that although the number of transactions ticked down by 3%, people spent about 9% more when they did make purchases. Lowe’s missed on expectations for same-store sales, but beat analyst estimates for earnings.\n\n“It speaks to the wealth effect of consumers who own homes,” Henry said.\n\nIncreasingly, experts worry that the divide between homeowners and renters is further driving economic inequality, as concerns grow that lower income households are losing more ground the longer inflation remains entrenched and prices for everything from groceries to rent keep rising.\n\nFor example, homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are insulated from rising rents and are “not necessarily having to bear that burden of higher housing prices,” Bruun said, noting that lower-income adults are more likely to be renters, not homeowners.\n\n“There’s reasons to be optimistic, but also reasons to be concerned. Inflation still is really high, even if it’s slowing down,” Bruun said. “That’s a really long time for consumers to be living with these elevated prices.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/politics/senate-gun-control-negotiations/index.html", "title": "America's deadly weekend of more mass shootings raise stakes for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn South Carolina and Texas, victims were shot at a high school graduation party. In Kentucky, funeral goers were hit outside a church. Multiple shooters sprayed a crowd with bullets in Philadelphia. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, shots rang out at a nightclub.\n\nJust America going about its normal business this weekend under the deadly daily shadow of gun violence, as a staggering 10 mass shootings since Friday deepened trauma from recent massacres at a Buffalo supermarket, a Texas elementary school and a mass shooting at a Tulsa, Oklahoma medical center.\n\nThe horrific new trail of death and injury, of broken families and mourning and fear, raised the stakes for the Senate’s latest effort to finally do something to stem the shootings and massacres and the costs for yet another political failure.\n\nTim Kelly, the mayor of Chattanooga, where three people were killed and 14 injured after a weekend shooting, warned on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday that “it’s going to be a long, hot summer” for cities like his unless Congress passes common sense gun reform.\n\nBut owing to political constraints rooted in conservative opposition to wide-ranging changes to the law, the congressional effort, led by Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Texas Sen John Cornyn, a Republican, may not fully address shootings like the one in Chattanooga. Still, the measure reaches a critical point this week even if it won’t be enough to end the violence in a nation awash in firearms.\n\nAnd if even one massacre is averted by incremental measures and some lives are saved, it could mark an important political win, and a sign that Washington can actually do something to mitigate a deadly threat.\n\nMurphy told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that despite formidable obstacles to success, he had never been more confident of getting something done after years fighting to tighten firearms laws following the massacre at an elementary school in his state in 2012, after which, reforms failed in Congress.\n\n“I’ve never been part of negotiations as serious as these. There are more Republicans at the table talking about changing our gun laws, investing in mental health than at any time since Sandy Hook,” Murphy told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I’ve also been part of many failed negotiations in the past, so I’m sober-minded about our chances.”\n\nMurphy said that the most likely areas for progress included “red flag” laws that can be used to confiscate weapons from people who are judged a danger or some tightening of background check rules in addition to more resources for mental health.\n\nMurphy on gun talks: 'The consequences of failure... are more significant than ever' 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nA fierce political debate\n\nThere is no realistic chance that President Joe Biden’s appeal in a moving televised address last Thursday for a ban on assault-style weapons used in many recent massacres will be successful.\n\nAnd even if Cornyn and Murphy can forge a deal, there will still be a gut check moment for Republican senators. At least 10 of them will be needed to vote with Democrats to overcome the filibuster requirement for a super majority in most votes in the chamber. And backing any restriction carries the risk of being branded a traitor by the most activist Republican voters who decide primaries and oppose any form of new restrictions.\n\nGOP leaders like ex-President Donald Trump are meanwhile portraying any tinkering around the edges of gun laws as the start of an inevitable slippery slope towards ending the Second Amendment, an exaggeration and mischaracterization that has often scuppered action in the past.\n\nStill, there are signs that the momentum towards tighter gun restrictions is growing in the country with polls showing majority support for tighter background checks and assault weapons bans. In one case, a group of 250 people who identified themselves as conservatives and gun owners took out an ad in the Dallas Morning News calling on Cornyn to work to enhance gun control.\n\n“We vote for Republican Senators. We believe in the Second Amendment. Like many, we are struggling for good answers to our current problem of gun violence in America,” the group wrote in an open letter.\n\nBut the structural impediments for reform remain strong. While many Americans see their right to bear arms as a critical plank of self-defense and national identity, polls show even many Republicans consider some kind of sensible extra regulations is necessary. But an activist minority in the GOP and the power of the gun lobby has thwarted almost all reform efforts in response to mass killings in recent years.\n\nThe question before the Senate this week then is not just whether the nation’s political estrangement allows the passage of some action to make the country a little safer. It is whether a genuine debate is even possible in a bitterly divided Washington about the true causes of the deaths of so many innocent people.\n\n“Enough, Enough,” Biden said on Thursday soon after his second trip in a few weeks to console those left behind after one of America’s mass killings. His words found an echo Sunday in Chattanooga, Tennessee where the city’s mayor spent his second weekend in a row holding a news conference after a mass killing.\n\n“Once again, we had people decide to solve their issues with firearms,” said Kelly, who is not officially affiliated with either party and who says he is a hunter and favors responsible gun ownership but wants to see expanded background checks and limits on high capacity magazines.\n\nHe continued, “I’m tired of standing in front of you talking about guns and bodies.”\n\nA deadly trail of weekend shootings\n\nBy early Sunday evening, figures detailing a weekend of violence had reached stunning levels, even given the regular daily toll of gun killings and incidents.\n\nSince Friday alone, there were 10 mass shootings in the country that killed at least 12 people and injured many more. That’s not to mention all the other smaller shootings that occurred, as part of the drum beat of death. At times at the weekend, news of more shootings came in at speeds that were difficult to believe.\n\nOf course, most Americans went about their business without coming into contact with violence. But the indiscriminate nature of shootings recently at schools, medical offices, supermarkets, at bars and at parties shows how deeply engrained the threat of gun violence is in everyday life. No one killed in these outrages had any reasons to think that their lives were about to end in relatively mundane locations.\n\nThree people were killed and 11 were wounded in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Police said multiple shooters fired into a crowd in the busy South Street night life area. “Once again, we see lives senselessly lost and those injured in yet another horrendous, brazen and despicable act of gun violence,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said.\n\nIn the incident in Tennessee, two people died from gunshot wounds and 14 were hurt at a shooting in Chattanooga. A third person died after being hit by a vehicle during the incident, police said.\n\nAcross the country, in Mesa, Arizona, two people were killed and two were wounded at a shooting at a bar.\n\nIn Phoenix, Arizona, a 14-year-old girl died and at least eight people were injured in a downtown shooting early on Saturday morning.\n\nIn yet another mass shooting, in Summerton, South Carolina, eight people were wounded and one was killed. Police told CNN affiliate WIS that two cars pulled into a yard where a high school graduation party was taking place. Victims ranged from 13 to 36 years old.\n\nFive people were wounded at another high school graduation party in Socorro,Texas, when someone started firing into a crowd.\n\nThree people were wounded and one was killed in an incident in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nIn Chesterfield, Virginia: one person was killed and another five were wounded\n\nAnd in, Macon, Georgia, three people were injured and one was killed when shots were fired in a neighborhood in Bibb County.\n\nIn several other incidents that would not be classified as mass shootings in recent days, two people attending a funeral were shot outside a church in Lexington, Kentucky, police said. Both were injured. And on Friday, a former judge in Wisconsin was shot dead in what police called a targeted attack.\n\nA huge political disconnect\n\nMurphy told CNN in his interview on “State of the Union” that the recent outburst of violence across the nation had taken anxiety about gun violence to levels he had not previously seen.\n\n“When I was in Connecticut last week, I have never seen the look on parents’ faces that I did. There’s just a deep, deep fear for our children right now,” he told Tapper. Murphy also said that there was “also a fear that government is so fundamentally broken that it can’t put politics aside to guarantee the one thing that matters most to adults in this country, the physical safety of their children.”\n\n“And so I think the possibility of success is better than ever before,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “But I think the consequences of failure for our entire democracy are more significant than ever.”\n\nYet the political position of many Republicans – as the party eyes big wins in the midterm elections in November – also weighs against the chances of success.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, the Republican House Minority whip, is a victim of gun violence himself after being gravely wounded in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. The Louisiana lawmaker however accused Democrats of using the recent mass shooting in Texas as an excuse to infringe gun rights and implied that such shootings almost always had a cause that could not be blamed simply on guns.\n\n“It immediately becomes about Democrats wanting to take away guns,” Scalise said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n“Let’s go search for the root of the problem. How can we do a better job of connecting the dots and stopping something before it happens. Like we did after September 11th, which has worked really well as it relates to stopping terrorist attacks,” Scalise said. When asked why the US had far more gun killings than other developed nations where firearms are far less available, he blamed what he said were “crazy” calls by liberal Democrats to defund the police.\n\nThe difference between Murphy and Scalise on this issue underscores the reasons why hopes for progress this week in Washington are tempered by the experience of the deep chasm that exists in the US on gun reform. And it raises questions over whether Washington will ever be able to keep Americans safe.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/09/30/40-best-gifts-sisters-gift-ideas-your-sister-actually-want/3534122001/", "title": "37 best gifts for sisters 2022: Gift ideas your sister will love", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

The BCI has yet to confirm the number of times Walker was shot, Mylett said, and it’s still not known how many rounds police officers fired.\n\n“However, based on the video, I anticipate that number to be high,” he said. “A lot of rounds were fired.”\n\nThe incident began about 12:30 a.m. last Monday, when police say Walker fled as officers attempted to initiate a traffic stop for traffic and equipment violations. About 40 seconds after the pursuit began, police say a gunshot was fired from Walker’s vehicle.\n\n“That changes the whole nature of the traffic stop,” Mylett said Sunday. “It went from being a routine traffic stop, to now a public safety issue. And then the pursuit continued.”\n\nAfter several minutes, Walker got out of his car and fled on foot, police said. Officers deployed Tasers, Mylett said, but they were unsuccessful in subduing Walker.\n\nThe incident ended soon after when, according to a police timeline, Walker “stopped and quickly turned towards the officers,” and officers discharged their weapons. At least one officer can be heard near the end of videos that were released shouting, “Cease fire.”\n\nThe eight officers who Mylett said were “directly involved in the shooting” have all been placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy. According to information released by the city, seven of the officers are White and one is Black.\n\nThe video is “something that should never, ever have to be seen,” Ken Abbarno, an attorney for Walker’s family, said at a separate news conference Sunday.\n\n“Each time I’ve watched the video, it’s gotten worse for me,” Abbarno said. “Every movement that I see, every shot that I heard, and every time that I see Jayland, lying on the ground, just gets more and more horrific.”\n\nJayland Walker is seen in an undated family photo. Family Photo\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nThe video released by police includes footage from the body-worn cameras of 13 officers who were at the scene.\n\nAccording to police, the events that led to the shooting began around 12:30 a.m., when police attempted to stop Walker, who was driving a silver Buick, for traffic and equipment violations.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after Walker drove away from police, “a sound consistent with a gunshot can be heard on the body-worn cameras of the officers,” police said in a narrated video timeline of the incident. Police also said “a flash of light” could be seen on the driver’s side of the car at the time of the sound.\n\nMylett said officers retrieved a shell casing near the scene of the attempted traffic stop that was “consistent with the firearm that Mr. Walker had in his vehicle. The BCI will determine whether or not that casing came from the gun or not.”\n\nHe added that a traffic camera captured “what we believe to be a muzzle flash coming out of the car. Again, the BCI will be determining whether or not that is the case.”\n\nToward the end of the pursuit, some of the footage shows the silver car Walker was driving stopping before he begins to exit the driver’s side of the vehicle.\n\nAt least one officer shouts, “Let me see your hands” and tells him not to move. The video shows Walker getting back into the car, which slowly moves forward. He is then seen getting out of the passenger side door and running from officers.\n\nThe police narration of the video says officers “attempted to safely take the suspect into custody by deploying their Tasers,” and shows a still frame of an officer deploying a Taser. The Tasers were unsuccessful and Walker continued to run, the narration says.\n\nDemonstrators protest the fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker in Akron, Ohio, on Saturday. Jeff Lange/USA Today\n\nAt least one officer yells for Walker to show his hands, one video shows. The foot chase continued for several seconds, and at one point Walker “stopped and quickly turned towards the pursuing officers,” the police narration says. “Officers reacted by discharging their firearms, striking the suspect.”\n\nDozens of gunshots are heard over seven seconds as officers fire at Walker, a number of the videos show.\n\nThe shooting ends after at least one officer shouts “Cease fire” three times.\n\nPolice said the images of Walker as he was shot have been blurred at the request of the family, but in some of the footage, he appears to be on the ground as gunfire continues.\n\nWalker died from multiple gunshot wounds to the face, abdomen and upper legs, CNN affiliate WEWS reported, citing findings by its media partner, the Akron Beacon Journal.\n\nThe Journal, which was allowed to review an investigative worksheet at the medical examiner’s office, said it “indicated that Walker was observed laying on his back and was in handcuffs when a medical examiner investigator arrived at the shooting scene.”\n\nA handgun and loaded magazine were found in Walker’s car after the shooting, police said, along with a gold ring.\n\nWalker family calls for change\n\nWalker’s family wants him to be remembered as a fun-loving young man who was full of life, said Robert Dejournett, a relative and the pastor of St. Ashworth Temple Church of God In Christ.\n\n“We’re God-fearing folk who believe in God and we want to exemplify that even in this process,” Dejournett told CNN. “We don’t want any rioting or anything like that.”\n\nThe family hopes the shooting will lead to change, Dejournett said.\n\n“We want to take that, and we want to use it for the benefit of systemic change,” Dejournett said. “We want to be treated like human beings, you know, Black men, young men, they’re afraid when it comes to police – that shouldn’t be,” he said.\n\nWhile the family wants answers from police, they also want the public to “give peace, give dignity, and give justice a chance – for Jayland,” attorneys for Walker’s family said after police released the footage.\n\nWalker “had never broken the law a day in his life – no crimes of any kind,” Bobby DiCello, another family lawyer, said.\n\nWalker’s behavior Monday “would be indicative of some distress, some fear, something that he was going through,” DiCello said.\n\nPolice union says use of force was justified\n\nThe Akron Police union believes the officers involved in the shooting were justified in their actions, “including (with) the number of shots fired,” according to a statement released Sunday by the Fraternal Order of Police Akron Lodge No. 7.\n\n“The decision to deploy lethal force as well as the number of shots fired is consistent with use of force protocols and officers’ training” the statement said.\n\nEach officer is “cooperating fully” with the independent investigation conducted by the BCI, the statement said.\n\nAhead of the release of the footage, Akron officials asked the community to be patient and allow the investigation to be carried out while protesting peacefully if they wished to demonstrate.\n\n“I won’t mince words – the video you are about to watch is heartbreaking and is very tough to take in,” Mayor Dan Horrigan said in a news conference ahead of the release of the footage.\n\nThe mayor acknowledged the rights of Akron residents to protest. “But I hope the community can agree, that violence and destruction are not the answer,” he said, asking that demonstrations remain peaceful.\n\n“Please be patient, and let the attorney general do their work,” he said.\n\nCity leaders underscored that footage was released under a new city ordinance that requires video footage documenting an active police officer’s use of force to be released within seven days of the incident.\n\nMylett said the city welcomes peaceful protests but is prepared if demonstrations turn violent.\n\n“We have developed an operations plan to manage and to provide safe space in this city for people to protest,” Mylett said. “And in case that it turns to a situation where it’s no longer peaceful, we have an operations plan in place for that as well, and I’m not going to discuss any of the details about that.”", "authors": ["Polo Sandoval Dakin Andone Samantha Beech", "Polo Sandoval", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech"], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/opinions/serena-williams-retirement-evolving-from-tennis-jones/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Serena Williams is rewriting retirement, just as she has ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN The Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

A generation later, Mom retired as a prison warden after 25 years.\n\nBack then, retirement meant collecting full pensions and full benefits. Their wish was to do little else than rest and recover from decades of body- and soul-crushing work that had zapped their mental and physical strength.\n\nRoxanne Jones CNN\n\nGrandpop, a war veteran, packed his bags and migrated back down South when he retired. And there he sat on his porch, enjoying my grandmom’s peach cobbler and listening to crickets until the day God called him home – just a decade later.\n\nCancer awaited Mom the day she retired. And she spent a decade battling before she, thankfully, won her body back and took flight. Today, she’s an adventure-seeking globetrotter.\n\nThat was retirement life for generations past. Sacrifice all for one job, not out of passion but out of a necessity to provide. Then, retire and pray for enough sunsets left to find joy.\n\nSerena Williams was right to reject the word “retirement” in her recent essay in Vogue that revealed she would be moving on, or “evolving,” from tennis after competition in the US Open.\n\nShe called it her evolution and she was right.\n\nIn this America, retirement – from pro sports or any other job – is not what it used to be.\n\nSerena Williams is congratulated by Venus Williams after winning the Women's Singles Final match at the Australian Open on January 28, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. Scott Barbour/Getty Images\n\nWilliams’ words resonated deeply for many, including myself, a woman and mother who walked away from a highly successful (though hardly Serena-level) corporate career in my early 40s.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” Williams wrote. “A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.”\n\nNever one to stick to just tennis, throughout her career Serena (and her sister Venus) were encouraged by their parents to explore their passions outside the game. That lesson has put Serena in a powerful position now as she begins to re-center her life.\n\nSerena Ventures, which the tennis champion launched in 2013, is her one of her passions now. According to Williams, the six-person firm (five women and one recently-hired man) has invested in 16 ventures (including MasterClass, Tonal and Impossible Foods to name a few) that are today valued at more then $1 billion.\n\n“Seventy-eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are.”\n\nIf Williams did all that while chasing tennis trophies, imagine what she will accomplish now.\n\nIt would be a mistake to scoff at her rejection of the word retirement. Though immediately after her announcement Monday, many women, and men, debated whether Serena – hands down one of the greatest athletes in the world – was conveniently playing semantics. Some said she was just another woman bowing out to have a baby.\n\nThe eye-rolling around Serena’s word choice is no surprise.\n\nOur culture struggles to validate powerful, iconic women like Williams, let alone other women who have excelled in their chosen fields. And society continues to view our ability to bear children as a weakness instead of the amazing superpower, that I’ve always believed it to be.\n\nSerena Williams posted this photo to Instagram of her and her daughter playing tennis, with the message, 'Caption this.' Serena Williams/Instagram\n\nBy using the word “evolve,” Serena has done what society has failed to do when it comes to framing talented women who excel early in a chosen career, then leave on their own terms and lean instead into themselves. Embracing our full humanity, many women shift their focus to other goals they can transcend in life, be it motherhood, launching a business or exploring other life passions.\n\nWatching women realize their limitless capacity for greatness is a beautiful thing. Williams’ life has been an inspiration for millions of women with less power and prestige. And her latest evolution is no different.\n\nMany women of all economic backgrounds, including those in my own peer group, are reimagining and expanding, what success looks like in our lives.\n\nIt isn’t an easy choice to make. Williams, who calls herself a “savage” competitor, knows her evolution will be painful. Despite breaking numerous records, winning four Olympic gold medals and 23 Grand Slam championships – surpassing tennis greats like Billie Jean King, Martina Hingis, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova – Williams is not yet rejoicing at this new turn in her life.\n\nNo, this phenomenal woman still only sees areas where she could have been greater: the wins she didn’t get to surpass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles. (It should be noted that Court won before the modern-day “open era” that began back in 1968.)\n\n“The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary,” Williams said in her essay, adding that she had no regrets about having a family over building her tennis resume.\n\nIt is this unabashed pursuit of excellence and warrior spirit – on the court and off – that have endeared Williams to so many.\n\nHer childbirth story is a familiar one among the Black women I know, who often cite inadequate medical care by health care professionals who ignored early warning signs during pregnancy.\n\nThe US maternal morbidity rates are among the worst the world among wealthy nations, especially for Black, Native American and rural women. So much so that recently, President Joe Biden launched a federal initiative to examine how racism, housing policy, policing, climate change and pollution affect maternal mortality rates.\n\nWilliams opined that were she a man, she would have had a longer career, free to pursue more championships. She could have been a Tom Brady, she said. It is a painful reckoning when women admit their professional goals will be cut short solely because of their gender.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

Mid-career after a rapid rise, countless awards and recording a lot of “firsts,” I had to face that my goal was far-fetched. In fact, no woman at the company – no matter her leadership skills, motherhood status or experience – was going to become president at the sports media giant. Not back then, not today.\n\nI remain hopeful for that day, but leaving is a move I’ve never regretted.\n\nWilliams and women who dare to step out into the world on their own terms are my superheroes.\n\nShe has grown the game of tennis immeasurably. She has redefined the women’s power game, attracted record-breaking TV audiences and revenue growth, won equal pay (along with her sister Venus), a battle that began with King. Williams has ushered in a new generation of fierce power hitters – and made it safer for them to show up as their authentic selves.\n\nSerena Williams came, she saw and she conquered.\n\nAnd I cannot wait to see what she does next.", "authors": ["Roxanne Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/03/ballet-for-seniors-dr-fauci-boblehead-patrots-plane-ferries-95-masks-news-from-around-our-50-states/2938509001/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}]}

Many other Italian towns are worried about similar pay-outs, especially in areas where nightlife has become “increasingly boisterous, particularly since the Covid pandemic”, the paper said.\n\nThe ruling has fuelled debate further afield too. The Daily Mail reported in October that Londoners were “fighting to save the city’s nightlife after becoming fed-up with the constant noise complaints threatening to close their local boozers”. Dozens of London pubs, clubs and music venues were served with noise complaints after two years of quiet during lockdowns.\n\n‘Fighting to save the city’s nightlife’\n\nPeople who live in capital cities should expect noise, said Samuel Kasumu, a Conservative contender for London mayor. “No offence, but it’s London,” the former Boris Johnson aide told the Evening Standard. “It’s the most cosmopolitan, most dynamic city in the world. So you know, deal with it.”\n\n“Fury was first sparked” in summer 2022 when the “iconic” 200-year-old Compton Arms in north London was served with a licence review by Islington Council, “after four new neighbours who moved into the area during lockdown complained that revellers were too noisy”, the Mail said. Pub bosses claim the pandemic has resulted in more noise complaints, as people “got used to the ‘Covid quiet’”.\n\nThe Jago, a live music venue in Dalston, east London, received a noise abatement notice from Hackney Council last year. “Since the pandemic, many surrounding buildings [in Hackney] have been converted into residential properties,” the venue wrote on Instagram. “This has resulted in noise complaints, which put the future of our venue and others at risk.”", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}]}
