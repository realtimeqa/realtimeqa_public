Nevin, drafted ahead of Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in the 1992 draft, becomes the first No. 1 overall draft pick to manage in the majors.\n\nMaddon, despite the mounting losses, was optimistic early Tuesday morning that the Angels could still turn things around in a text message to USA TODAY Sports. He believed they could easily have a 12-game winning streak.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\n‚ÄúWorking on positive vibes and fundamentals,‚Äô‚Äô he said. ‚ÄúThe guys aren‚Äôt happy, but are together.‚Äô‚Äô\n\nWell, the Angels front office had different thoughts, and when Minasian awoke, he called owner Arte Moreno to ask for permission to make the change. He drove to his house and fired Maddon, who had lost some key support in the clubhouse.\n\n‚ÄúWaking up today, I felt it was the right thing to do,‚Äô‚Äô Minasian said at the Angels‚Äô press conference. ‚ÄúI just felt it was the best decision for the organization.‚Äô‚Äô\n\nIt was a year ago when Albert Pujols was released by the Angels that he informed Minasian and president John Carpino that they would never win as long as Maddon was the manager. Several veterans privately thanked Pujols for speaking out. The Angels finished with their second consecutive fourth-place finish, but they stuck with Maddon, believing he deserved one more chance.\n\nThey started off 24-13, had AL West division hopes dancing in their heads, and then along came a 12-game losing streak, equaling the franchise's single-season record.\n\n‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt one phase of the game we‚Äôve been good,‚Äô‚Äô Minasian said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something I thought would happen three weeks ago.\"\n\nPRIDE NIGHT: Some Rays relievers opt not to wear multicolored hat, decal\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Subscribe to our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nMaddon, in the final year of a three-year, $12 million contract, had a $4 million option or $1 million buyout in 2023. He was hopeful he‚Äôd finish his career in the Angels organization. He let it be known this spring that he wanted a contract extension. The Angels refused, believing all along they would fire him if they failed to make the playoffs.\n\nWith their losing streak extended to 12 games Monday night after a 1-0 loss to the Boston Red Sox, the Angels simply didn‚Äôt believe they could reach the postseason with Maddon at the helm.\n\nThey made the move now with a record of 27-29 -- 8¬Ω games behind the division-leading Houston Astros, but just 1¬Ω games out of the final AL wild-card spot.\n\n‚ÄúI understand if you‚Äôre an Angels fan, nobody‚Äôs happy,‚Äù Maddon said Monday. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs early enough in here to do something different about this, and we intend to.‚Äù\n\nThe Angels front office listened, and decided to do something different themselves.\n\nReally, it shouldn‚Äôt have come as any surprise. Maddon was never Minasian‚Äôs guy; he simply inherited him.\n\nThen again, he wasn‚Äôt former Angels GM Billy Eppler‚Äôs guy, either.\n\nEppler wanted to hire Showalter as manager when Brad Ausmus was fired, but he was overruled by Moreno.\n\nNow, Minasian has a man who should have been hired years ago as manager in Nevin. He was the choice of Tony La Russa and Dave Stewart to replace Chip Hale with the Arizona Diamondbacks, but they were overruled by ownership, too.\n\nThis is an Angels team that has reached the postseason just once since Mike Trout‚Äôs arrival, and none with Shohei Ohtani. They were built to win this year. Yet, after losing just two fewer games in 13 days than the Yankees have lost all season, Minasian believed a change was needed to save the season.\n\n‚ÄúI just felt it was time for a new voice,‚Äô‚Äô Minasian said. ‚ÄúI think we have the right group of individuals. We have 106 games to prove it. And I‚Äôm excited about the next 106 games. But talk is cheap.‚Äô‚Äô\n\nThis was the second firing of a veteran manager in a week, with Joe Girardi dumped by the Philadelphia Phillies and replaced by interim Rob Thomson.\n\nIronically, Maddon was a candidate for the Phillies job when they hired Girardi, but pulled himself out of the running, interviewing only with the Angels after the Cubs cut ties with him.\n\nMaddon, 68, who led the Cubs to a World Series title, and the Tampa Bay Rays to an American League pennant, says he wants to keep managing. He has no plans to retire. There could be a half-dozen openings this summer and winter.\n\nMaybe he could be the difference-maker in Seattle. Maybe he could get the youthful Kansas City Royals going. Maybe he could sell tickets in Miami.\n\nWho knows, maybe he could return home to Pennsylvania, where the Phillies are expected to conduct a full managerial search if they don‚Äôt reach the playoffs this season.\n\nStranger things have happened in the managerial carousel, and in Anaheim, well, it has become a way of life. The only manager who has lasted three full seasons in the Angels organization since 1987 is Mike Scioscia.\n\nNevin, who was fired as the Yankees third base coach after last season, becomes the Angels‚Äô fourth manager in five years.\n\n‚ÄúI think he‚Äôll do great,‚Äô‚Äô Yankees manager Aaron Boone, one of Nevin‚Äôs closest friends, told reporters. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a great baseball guy. He‚Äôs certainly paid his dues.

(AP) ‚Äî The Los Angeles Angels hired Ron Washington to be their new manager Wednesday, turning to a veteran baseball mind in an attempt to end nearly a decade of losing.\n\nThe 71-year-old Washington became the majors' oldest current manager and only the second active Black manager, joining Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n‚ÄúI'm lost for words, but not the work it will take!‚Äù Washington told The Associated Press by text message.\n\nWashington led the Texas Rangers from 2007-14, winning two AL pennants and going 664‚Äì611. He spent the past seven seasons as Atlanta‚Äôs third base coach, helping the Braves to their 2021 World Series title.\n\nWashington replaced Phil Nevin, who wasn't re-signed last month after 1 1/2 losing seasons in charge of the long-struggling Angels. Los Angeles is mired in stretches of eight consecutive losing seasons and nine straight non-playoff seasons, both the longest streaks in the majors.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nWashington has never shied away from work: He's regularly among the first on the field, hitting hundreds of grounders to infielders.\n\nArte Moreno, the Angels' 77-year-old owner, clearly hopes the experienced Washington can get the most out of a long-underachieving franchise with a big payroll and three-time AL MVP Mike Trout, but almost no team success to show for it. Shohei Ohtani, the team's superstar two-way player, became a free agent this week.\n\nWashington got a two-year contract. He's the fourth manager in the last six seasons for the Angels following the departure of Mike Scioscia, who spent 19 years running the Halos' bench before walking away after the 2018 season. Brad Ausmus, Joe Maddon and Nevin have all tried and failed to reverse the Angels' slide.\n\nWashington's successful tenure at Texas had plenty of bumps along the way. He tested positive for cocaine use during the 2009 season and offered to resign, but he kept his job and led the Rangers to the World Series in 2010 and again in 2011.\n\nWashington abruptly resigned from the Rangers on Sept. 5, 2014, surprising the baseball world. Two weeks later, he acknowledged having an extramarital affair and cited it as the reason for leaving Texas, which had intended to bring him back in 2015.\n\nWith a reputation as a personable, old-school manager with an ebullient personality and an exciting edge, Washington also knows the AL West well. Along with his time in Texas, he spent 13 seasons over two stints as a coach with the Oakland Athletics.\n\nIn the 2011 film ‚ÄúMoneyball,‚Äù about the A's unlikely 2000s success, Washington was played by actor Brent Jennings, who delivered one of the movie's most memorable lines when urged by GM Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) to tell a player how easy it is to learn how to play first base: ‚ÄúIt's incredibly hard!‚Äù\n\nIn real life, Washington is one of the most respected infield coaches in the game's history ‚Äî and former A's third baseman Eric Chavez once gifted Washington one of his Gold Gloves because he played such a vital role.

While better than last year's 102-loss team, they haven‚Äôt made the desired progress this year, or even had a winning record at any point since spending a half-billion dollars last winter to sign shortstop Corey Seager and second baseman Marcus Semien.\n\n‚ÄúWe did not come into this season thinking we had put together a championship roster. We thought we‚Äôd taken a major step forward in talent from where we were a year ago,‚Äù said Jon Daniels, the team‚Äôs president of baseball operations. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve certainly had aspirations maybe to overachieve some and still do have those, but we were, and continue to be, realistic about about where we are. ... That said, we did think that we‚Äôd be better than our record, and better than the way that we‚Äôve played at times.‚Äù\n\nAfter peaking at 24-24 at the end of May, Texas lost its next three games and five of six. The Rangers, who were 6-24 in one-run games under Woodward, beat Oakland 2-1 on Monday night in third base coach Tony Beasley's first game as interim manager. Texas improved to 52-63 and has won three straight for the first time in two months.\n\nWoodward, the fourth big league manager to be fired this season, was two games shy of managing his 500th game for the Rangers. He finished with a 211-287 record, which came during the extended rebuilding process that also included the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and the MLB lockout last winter after the Rangers had signed Seager and Semien.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nPhiladelphia‚Äôs Joe Girardi was replaced by Rob Thomson on June 3, the Los Angeles Angels‚Äô Joe Maddon by Phil Nevin four days later and Toronto‚Äôs Charlie Montoyo by John Schneider on July 13.\n\nDaniels, who was the general manager when Woodward was hired, and current GM Chris Young both spoke about making the managerial change now to start addressing items such as how the team prepares and its style of play.\n\n‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs just the overall structure, the environment. It‚Äôs not necessarily the content of the preparation, but the way it‚Äôs utilized,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúThe way we utilize meetings, the way we utilize different resources throughout the day, creating a structure that‚Äôs really tailored towards winning a game every single day when we come in, and we felt like at times that got a little loose.‚Äù\n\nWoodward, who was the third base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers before landing his first managerial job, was under contract through next season. The team held an option for 2024.\n\nSeager spent his first seven big league seasons with the Dodgers, and was the National League rookie of the year in 2016, the first of Woodward‚Äôs three seasons as the third base and infield coach in Los Angeles. Seager was reunited with Woodward after signing a $325 million, 10-year contract last December.\n\n‚ÄúObviously, he was a really important person in my career and in my life. He was around me at a really pivotal point in my career. And I don‚Äôt have anything bad to say. I have the utmost respect for him,‚Äù Seager said on the field before Monday‚Äôs game. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those things I just wish we could have played a little better and maybe outcomes would be different. ‚Äù\n\nAlong with Seager and Semien ($175 million, seven years), the Rangers also last winter signed right-hander Jon Gray (four-year, $56 million) to be at the top of their rotation. Gray was in his best stretch of the season before a left oblique injury earlier this month that could potentially sideline him the rest of the year.\n\nBeasley is in his eighth season with the Rangers, and is the longest-tenured member of their big-league coaching staff. He previously was on the major league staffs with Washington (2006) and Pittsburgh (2008-10), and had a 590-472 record in eight seasons as a minor league manager in those organizations.\n\n‚ÄúHe has all the attributes that we‚Äôre looking for. He has the respect of the staff, the respect of the players,‚Äù Daniels said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an intelligent baseball veteran, who's won at the minor league level, performed in a variety of roles, both here and elsewhere. ... He‚Äôs the right person for us as we move forward.‚Äù\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/10/09/2022-mlb-award-predictions-aaron-judge-mvp-cy-young-rookie-picks/8221158001/", "title": "2022 MLB award predictions: Aaron Judge is MVP; Cy Young ...", "text": "ST.

Aaron Judge, Yankees: The Yankees are a wild-card team, at best, without Judge, who carried this team all season with one of the greatest offensive performances in history: .311/.426/.686, 62 home runs and 131 RBI. And, oh yeah, he plays tremendous defense, too.\n\n2. Shohei Ohtani, Angels: He‚Äôs the best player in the game, but then again, so was Barry Bonds, and the baseball writers didn‚Äôt give him the MVP award 20 consecutive years. The Angels, the last we looked, finished 33 games out of first place. If Ohtani kept them in contention, this award race might be a different story.\n\n3. Jose Ramirez, Guardians: Sure, he didn‚Äôt even have the best all-around season on his own team with second baseman Andres Gimenez‚Äôs stellar year. Yet, the Guardians are sitting home and watching the playoffs on TV if Ramirez hadn‚Äôt picked up a pen and signed that team-friendly seven-year, $141 million contract. He made his teammates believe they can win the AL Central. The man chose to stay in Cleveland rather than be traded to the Padres ‚Äì who were prepared to give him a much more lucrative contract extension. Pretty cool to be a Guardians fan these days.\n\nAL Cy Young\n\n1. Justin Verlander, Astros: He‚Äôs 39 years old, coming off Tommy John surgery, pitching just six innings in the last two years, and then has one of the most sensational seasons in history. He produces a 1.75 ERA, the lowest by an American League pitcher in a full season since Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez in 2000. Maybe Verlander really can become the next 300-win pitcher. You going to bet against him?\n\n2. Dylan Cease, White Sox: He was a one-man show all season, putting on one of the greatest pitching clinics in White Sox history. He permitted no more than one earned run in 23 of his 32 starts. And he set an MLB record by yielding one or zero earned runs in 14 consecutive starts from May 29-Aug. 11 (0.66 ERA). He somehow did not make the All-Star team.\n\n3. Alek Manoah, Blue Jays: Go ahead, you can ask the Yankees, Red Sox and everyone else in the AL East, and they‚Äôll tell you that he‚Äôs best pitcher they saw all year. The All-Star just got better as the year went along, going 4-0 with a 0.88 ERA in six September starts, yielding a .162 batting average. He finished the year thid in the AL in wins (16) and ERA (2.24).\n\nAL Rookie of the Year\n\n1. Julio Rodriguez, Mariners: The Mariners had high expectations for the 21-year-old kid, but couldn‚Äôt believe what they were seeing all season. He struggled in April, hitting just .206 without a home run, and proceeded to finish with 28 home runs, along with 25 steals. He hit .394 with seven homers in September when the Mariners needed him the most. He‚Äôs the Mariners‚Äô greatest young player since Alex Rodriguez and the Mariners believe in him so much that they gave him a $209.3 million contract that might turn out to be a steal.\n\n2. Adley Rutschman, Orioles: It‚Äôs a shame he wasn‚Äôt up all year. Rutschman could have been the difference in the Orioles making the playoffs. He‚Äôs certainly a star in the making, hitting .254 with an .806 OPS, leading all rookies with 35 doubles, and ranking second in walks, on-base percentage and OPS.\n\n3. Steven Kwan, Guardians: He had a sensational rookie season, hitting .298 with 19 stolen bases and 52 RBI, and was one of the top defensive left fielders in the game. But because he plays in Cleveland, nobody really noticed. He's a key reason the Guardians will be playing the Yankees in the AL Division Series.\n\nAL Manager of the Year\n\n1. Terry Francona, Guardians: This may be the closest race of all of the awards that will be announced in November. Yet, this may be Francona‚Äôs greatest season in his Hall of Fame career. When you take the youngest team in baseball to the postseason, you deserve the greatest honor.\n\n2. Brandon Hyde, Orioles: They were the most surprising team in baseball, the first team since at least 1900 to lose 110 games one year and have a winning season (83-79) the next. They stayed in contention until the final week. Even when the front office gave up on the team, trading away their All-Star closer Jorge Lopez and team leader Trey Mancini at the deadline, Hyde made sure his players didn‚Äôt quit, too. Hyde has this team believing they will be in the playoffs in 2023.\n\n3. Scott Servais, Mariners: Things looked as gloomy as the Seattle sky in May, but they turned it around, going from 10 games under .500 to 11 games over .500 in two months. The Mariners never looked back. Servais pushed all of the right buttons and now has a team that could be a force for years to come. On Saturday, they became the third team in history to overcome a seven-run deficit in the playoffs, advancing to the ALDS.\n\nNL MVP\n\n1. Paul Goldschmidt, Cardinals: Sure, he hit just .245 with two homers and 10 RBI in September, but he was the one who carried the Cardinals to the finish line, wrapping up the division title with weeks to spare. He ranked among the top five in 11 offensive categories, leading the NL with a .981 OPS.\n\n2. Manny Machado, Padres: The Padres kept trying to get help for Machado, even making the monstrous deal to get Juan Soto and Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals. They were massive disappointments in the regular season, with Machado still having to be a one-man show with no protection. No matter, he delivered, again and again, and has emerged as the team leader. The Padres don‚Äôt make the playoffs, or even come close, without Machado.\n\n3. Nolan Arenado, Cardinals: Arenado and Goldschmidt are the Mantle-Maris of the Midwest. They feed off another, bringing out the greatest in each of them. And for all of those who questioned whether Arenado could put up the same great numbers outside Coors Field, take a look: .293, 30 homers, 102 RBI, .891 OPS.\n\nNL Cy Young\n\n1. Sandy Alcantara, Marlins: He‚Äôs an old-school pitcher in 2022, a modern-day Bob Gibson. He could care less about pitch counts, thrives in pressure situations, and is as fierce a competitor as any pitcher in the game. He had more complete games (6) than any team in baseball, while throwing a major-league leading 228 ‚Öî innings.\n\n2. Julio Urias, Dodgers: Simply, he‚Äôs the most underrated pitcher in baseball. He‚Äôs 37-10 with a 2.57 ERA the past two years and once again won‚Äôt win the Cy Young award. He‚Äôs dwarfed in attention by future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw, along with three other MVPs on the team, but he‚Äôs quietly been their top pitcher.\n\n3. Edwin Diaz, Mets: He produced one of the most dominant seasons by a closer since the steroid era. He had 32 saves and a stunning 118 strikeouts in 62 innings. No player was more responsible for the Mets‚Äô resurgence than Diaz.\n\nNL Rookie of the Year\n\n1. Michael Harris, Atlanta: He was called up in late May and Atlanta's season took off a few days later. He was just what the team needed to kick-start its resurgence, hitting .297 with 19 homers and 64 RBI. No rookie position player had a greater impact. Atlanta was 22-24 before Harris arrived, and went a major-league best 79-37 the rest of the season.\n\n2. Spencer Strider, Atlanta: If not for his own teammate, Strider would win the award. He was one of the most dominant rookie pitchers the game has seen, the quickest to strike out 200 batters in history. He also is the first pitcher to finish the year with 200 or more strikeouts while permitting fewer than 100 hits. He averaged a ridiculous 13.8 strikeouts per nine innings (202 in 131 ‚Öî innings). Yet, because he‚Äôs a pitcher, and not an everyday player like Harris, he‚Äôll be the runner-up.\n\n3. Brendan Donovan, Cardinals: He played virtually everywhere for the Cardinals, starting at six different positions. He‚Äôs the first player since at least 1900 to start four different infield positions in his first four MLB games. He led all rookies with a .394 on-base percentage, and ranked second in the NL with 110 hits and 64 runs.\n\nNL manager of the year\n\n1. Buck Showalter, Mets: How in the world was this guy out of baseball for three years? He changed the entire culture of the Mets organization, just as he‚Äôs done everywhere he‚Äôs gone. Before he retires ‚Äì write it down ‚Äì he will win a World Series.\n\n2. Brian Snitker, Atlanta: He‚Äôs the new Bobby Cox. It was his team meeting that woke up the team on June 1 on a sleepy morning in Phoenix, and they went on one of the finest runs in baseball history. They have won five consecutive division titles under Snitker, who may be making his own Hall of Fame case.\n\n3. Rob Thomson, Phillies : Hey, why not keep it all in the NL East? He took over a team that was lifeless, hadn't been to the postseason in 11 years and led them to a 65-46 record and playoff berth. He‚Äôs the calming force behind the Phillies‚Äô resurrection.\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n‚Äì The San Francisco Giants will pursue not only Yankees star Aaron Judge in free agency, but also Dodgers All-Star shortstop Trea Turner.\n\nIf the Yankees won‚Äôt pay the $300 million Judge wants, he could wind up in San Francisco ‚Äì just two hours away from his hometown.\n\nTurner is open to staying in Los Angeles, but is believed to prefer the East Coast and may be the No. 1 target for the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nYet, money may be no object, with the Giants willing to do anything for a return to the postseason, winning 26 fewer games than a year ago.\n\n‚ÄúWe do have the flexibility to be involved in every possible option on the table,\" Giants president Farhan Zaidi said.\n\n‚Äì The Los Angeles Angels will be sold for at least $3 billion, a record price for a baseball franchise, several MLB owners believe. The negotiations are brisk, and the sale is expected to be consummated within the next few months.\n\n‚Äì The Chicago White Sox want to hire a veteran manager to replace Tony La Russa, not wanting to take a chance on someone with no experience.\n\nSome managers who fit the bill: Bruce Bochy, Mike Shildt, Ron Washington, John Gibbons, Bo Porter, Joe Girardi, Joe Maddon.\n\nBochy, Washington and Shildt are considered the leading candidates.\n\n‚Äì The Orioles will be paying awfully close attention to the Rookie of the Year balloting this year. If catcher Adley Rutschman finishes in the top two, he‚Äôll receive a full year of service time, permitting him to be eligible for free agency after six years under the new collective bargaining agreement. If he doesn‚Äôt finish in the top two, his free agency will be delayed until 2028 because he wasn‚Äôt called up until 40 games into the season.\n\n‚Äì Just how strange was it seeing Max Scherzer‚Äôs stinker in Game 1 of the wild card series?\n\nIt was only the second time that a pitcher coughed up four homers and seven runs in the same postseason game, joining Cincinnati Reds starter Gene Thompson in Game 3 of the 1939 World Series. Scherzer had done it only once in his entire regular-season career, spanning 421 starts.\n\nWhile Scherzer may insist he‚Äôs healthy, several scouts are convinced he‚Äôs playing through oblique pain.\n\n‚Äì Giants third baseman Evan Longoria wants to return for one final season, but the Giants have no plans to pick up his $13 million option and will instead pay a $5 million buyout.\n\nThe only teams Longoria would consider playing for are the Giants, Tampa Bay Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\n‚Äì The White Sox loved having Jose Abreu the past nine years, and he has been nothing but a class act and valuable hitter, but they plan to part ways with him. Simply, they need to shake up their team, and are making virtually everyone but Dylan Cease and Andrew Vaughn available in trades.\n\n‚Äì The Giants are hoping to trade infielder Tommy La Stella this winter. He had surgery on both Achilles tendons last winter and struggled this season. He‚Äôs owed $11.5 million next season.\n\n‚Äì Angels manager Phil Nevin, who was given a one-year contract for 2023, has seen a lot of baseball since he was the No. 1 draft pick over Derek Jeter and everyone else in the 1992 draft.\n\nBut after watching Shohei Ohtani for just one season, he says: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the best baseball player I think anybody has ever seen, to be honest. I really believe that. All around.

He‚Äôs owed $37 million over the next two seasons, and the D-backs would likely have to eat most of it.

Here's where talks stand", "text": "Andrew Dalton\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî While screenwriters are busy back at work, film and TV actors remain on picket lines, with the longest strike in their history set to hit 100 days on Saturday after talks broke off with studios. Here's a look at where things stand, how their stretched-out standoff compares to past strikes, and what happens next.\n\nHopes were high and leaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists were cautiously optimistic when they resumed negotiations on Oct. 2 for the first time since the strike began 2 1/2 months earlier.\n\nThe same group of chief executives from the biggest studios had made a major deal just over a week earlier with striking writers, whose leaders celebrated their gains on many issues actors are also fighting for: long-term pay, consistency of employment and control over the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut the actors' talks were tepid, with days off between sessions and no reports of progress. Then studios abruptly ended them on Oct. 11, saying the actors' demands were exorbitantly expensive and the two sides were too far apart to continue.\n\n\"We only met with them a couple of times, Monday, half a day Wednesday, half a day Friday. That was what they were available for,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher told The Associated Press soon after the talks broke off. \"Then this past week, it was Monday and a half a day on Wednesday. And then \"Bye bye. I've never really met people that actually don't understand what negotiations mean. Why are you walking away from the table?\"\n\nActors strike talks with studio executives broke 'momentum'\n\nThe studios said the SAG-AFTRA proposals would cost them an untenable $800 million annually. The union said that number was a 60% overestimate.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, one of the executives in on the bargaining sessions, said that at the session that spurred the studios to walk away, the union had asked for \"a subscriber levy unrelated to viewing or success\" on every subscriber to streaming services.\n\n\"This really broke our momentum unfortunately,\" Sarandos told investors on a Netflix earnings call Wednesday.\n\nSAG-AFTRA leaders said it was ridiculous to frame this demand as though it were a tax on customers, and said it was the executives themselves who wanted to shift from a model based on a show's popularity to one based on number of subscribers.\n\n\"We made big moves in their direction that have just been ignored and not responded to,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's national executive director and chief negotiator, told the AP. \"We made changes to our AI proposal. We made dramatic changes to what used to be our streaming revenue share proposal,\" Crabtree-Ireland said.\n\nActors strike next steps uncertain\n\nThe actors are in unscripted territory, with no end in sight. Their union has never been on a strike this long, nor been on strike at all since before many of its members were born. Not even its veteran leaders, like Crabtree-Ireland, with the union for 20 years, have found themselves in quite these circumstances.\n\nAs they did for months before the talks broke off, members and leaders will rally, picket and speak out publicly until the studios signal a willingness to talk again. No one knows how long that will take. SAG-AFTRA says it is willing to resume at any time, but that won't change its demands.\n\n\"I think that they think that we're going to cower,\" Drescher said. \"But that's never going to happen because this is a crossroads and we must stay on course.\"\n\nThe studio alliance said in a statement after the talks broke off that they had made generous-but-rejected offers in every disputed area. \"We hope that SAG-AFTRA will reconsider and return to productive negotiations soon,\" the statement said.\n\nThe writers did have their own false start with studios that may give some reason for optimism. Their union attempted to restart negotiations with studios in mid-August, more than three months into their strike. Those talks went nowhere, breaking off after a few days. A month later, the studio alliance came calling again. Those talks took off, with most of their demands being met after five marathon days that resulted in a tentative deal that its members would vote to approve almost unanimously.\n\nActors strike longest-ever, 3rd in history\n\nHollywood actors strikes have been less frequent and shorter than those by writers. The Screen Actors Guild (they added the \"AFTRA\" in a 2011 merger) has gone on strike against film and TV studios only three times in its history.\n\nIn each case, emerging technology fueled the dispute. In 1960 ‚Äî the only previous time actors and writers struck simultaneously ‚Äî the central issue was actors seeking pay for when their work in film was aired on television, compensation the industry calls residuals. The union, headed by future U.S. President Ronald Reagan, was a smaller and much less formal entity then. The vote to strike took place in the home of actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, the parents of current SAG-AFTRA member and vocal striker Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nMid-strike, the actors and studios called a truce so all could attend the Academy Awards ‚Äî a move forbidden under today's union rules. Host Bob Hope called the gathering \"Hollywood's most glamorous strike meeting.\"\n\nIn the end, a compromise was reached where SAG dropped demands for residuals from past films in exchange for a donation to their pension fund, along with a formula for payment when future films aired on TV. Their 42-day work stoppage began and ended all within the span of the much longer writers strike.\n\nA 1980 strike would be the actors' longest for film and television until this year. That time, they were seeking payment for their work appearing on home video cassettes and cable TV, along with significant hikes in minimum compensation for roles. A tentative deal was reached with significant gains but major compromises in both areas. Union leadership declared the strike over after 67 days, but many members were unhappy and balked at returning to work. It was nearly a month before leaders could rally enough votes to ratify the deal.\n\nThis time, it was the Emmy Awards that fell in the middle of the strike. The Television Academy held a ceremony, but after a boycott was called, only one acting winner, Powers Boothe, was there to accept his trophy.\n\nOther segments of the actors union have gone on strike too, including several long standoffs over the TV commercials contract. A 2016-2017 strike by the union's video game voice actors lasted a whopping 11 months. That segment of the union could strike again soon if a new contract deal isn't reached.\n\nMissing the Emmy Awards?What's happening with the strike-delayed celebration of television\n\nStrike's effect on movies and TV: Actors will suspend production\n\nThe return of writers has gotten the Hollywood production machine churning again, with rooms full of scribes penning new seasons of shows that had been suspended and film writers finishing scripts. But the finished product will await the end of actors strike, and production will remain suspended many TV shows and dozens of films, including \"Wicked,\" \"Deadpool 3\" and \"Mission Impossible ‚Äî Dead Reckoning Part 2.\"\n\nThe Emmys, whose nominations were announced the same day the actors strike was called, opted to wait for the stars this time and move their ceremony from September to January, though that date could be threatened too.\n\nThe Oscars are a long way off in March, but the campaigns to win them are usually well underway by now. With some exceptions ‚Äî non-studio productions approved by the union ‚Äî performers are prohibited from promoting their films at press junkets or on red carpets. Director Martin Scorsese has been giving interviews about his new Oscar contender \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" Star and SAG-AFTRA member Leonardo DiCaprio hasn't.\n\nWho is in SAG-AFTRA, anyway?The union has more working class actors than movie stars", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/09/21/when-will-writers-actors-strike-end-2023/70919542007/", "title": "Why the Hollywood strikes are not over even after screenwriters and ...", "text": "Hollywood is getting back to work.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, reached a tentative deal to end the 146-day screenwriters' strike late Sunday night.\n\nCEOs of Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal's studios stepped in last week to avert a stalemate, holding meetings with the writers' union through the weekend to settle thorny issues of pay, benefits and guaranteed work.\n\nBut the strike, which has largely shuttered work on American movies, TV dramas and sitcoms, and late-night talk shows, was followed by another walkout by actors on July 14. Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher (\"The Nanny\") took a hardline stance and laid plans for a six-month walkout, acknowledging that many others ‚àí from caterers to makeup artists ‚àí were caught in the crossfire and left jobless.\n\n\"The gravity of a commitment like this is not lost on any of us. It's major,\" she told USA TODAY in July. \"But we also see that we have no future and no livelihood unless we take this action, unfortunately.\"\n\nWhat's happening now, and when will your entertainment diet go back to normal? We explain.\n\nAre the Hollywood strikes over yet?\n\nNo, not quite.\n\nThe writers' battle with the AMPTP, which handles labor negotiations on behalf of eight major studios and streaming services, has ended. Picketing has been suspended, and the writers were permitted to return to work Wednesday while the full WGA membership votes on the settlement terms, expected by early October.\n\nWhile writers can resume penning scripts, the actors, represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have to negotiate their own settlement. Labor experts expect they will use some of what WGA agrees to as a template.\n\nSAG-AFTRA statement began negotiations with the studios on Oct. 2, their first meeting since the actors' strike began.\n\nWhat's at stake? Both say they are earning less money as TV seasons grow shorter in an age of streaming: Where a network sitcom would guarantee 22 episodes a year, streaming shows often produce as few as eight or 10 episodes. Actors and writers also earn fewer royalty payments from syndication or overseas runs of shows and movies as streamers demand worldwide exclusive rights to them.\n\nTerms of the tentative screenwriters' deal were not immediately made public.\n\nWill my favorite talk shows return when writers go back to work?\n\nYes. Late-night talk shows ‚àí the first to be noticeably missing when the WGA strike began ‚àí are back Oct. 2. But Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers can't book actors to promote past or current movie or TV projects until the actors' strike is settled: Such promotion is explicitly banned by SAG, even on social media. But the restriction wouldn't hurt other shows that don't depend on such guests, including HBO's \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" and \"Real Time With Bill Maher.\"\n\nDaytime talk shows also can return, although some ‚àí including ABC's \"The View\" and the syndicated \"Live With Kelly and Mark\" ‚àí are produced under separate contracts and remained on the air. Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson and Drew Barrymore ‚àí who announced a plan to resume without writers but quickly backpedaled after an outcry by strikers, as did Hudson and CBS' \"The Talk\" ‚àí should also resume fairly quickly. (\"The Talk\" returns Oct. 9.) NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is unlikely to be back until both strikes are settled.\n\nHowever, getting writers back to work gives studios a head start on writing movies and scripted series, so that production can resume quickly when actors return.\n\nWhy did the studios suddenly want to settle?\n\nThe AMPTP and the unions took aggressive postures as the WGA strike dragged on (the last one, in 2007-08, lasted 100 days). The studios argued in previous contract talks that streaming has upended traditional business models, and they needed more time to sort out how that affects the economics of TV and movie production. A vast increase in the number of projects, dubbed \"Peak TV\" by one executive, followed streamers' desire to build subscribers at any cost. But their voracious appetites have cooled amid Wall Street's demands for profits, and fewer movies and TV shows are on the horizon. The unions say they've been patient, but view 2023 as an inflection point: If they don't share more of the fruits of their work now, they never will.\n\nYet pressure has mounted on studios, many of which have seen declines in their stock prices since the WGA strike began. While they're saving money they would otherwise spend to produce shows and movies, they're losing more revenue at the box office, as well as ad money from lower TV ratings. And streaming services risk losing subscribers if they run out of new programming.\n\nWhat happens if talks break down?\n\nIf the actors' strike isn't settled in the coming weeks ‚Äï no talks have been scheduled ‚Äï broadcasters will have a hard time salvaging the traditional TV season, which began Sept. 25. Their schedules are littered with reality competitions, game shows, reruns and foreign imports with few recognizable stars. (NBC produced and banked episodes of a handful of new and returning dramas, including reboots of \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Magnum, P.I.,\" before the strikes.)\n\nStreamers have longer lead times, and movie studios longer still, so you probably haven't noticed much change in the number of new and returning shows ... yet. But even after a settlement, an emptier pipeline means there'll be fewer shows next year while producers catch up. Some studios and networks have delayed premieres of new movies (\"Dune 2\") and series (\"Fargo\") to spread out their slates and fill empty spots on their calendars.\n\nWhat movies are delayed due to writers strike?\n\nSeveral movies and awards shows have been pushed back by the strike, with some films delayed by years.\n\nDisney postponed the release of the next three installments of James Cameron's blockbuster \"Avatar\" series: ‚ÄúAvatar 3‚Äù moves to Dec. 19, 2025, ‚ÄúAvatar 4‚Äù to Dec. 21, 2029, and ‚ÄúAvatar 5‚Äù to Dec. 19, 2031.\n\nMarvel has reshuffled its cinematic universe, with ‚ÄúCaptain America: Brave New World‚Äù moving to July 26, 2024. \"Thunderbolts\" pushing back to Dec. 20, 2024, and ‚ÄúBlade‚Äù moving to Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nAside from delaying \"Dune 2,\" Warner Bros. has moved \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" a month to April 12, 2024, while animated \"Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\" is now slated for Dec. 13, 2024.\n\nSony moved ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter\" to Aug. 30, 2024 (Labor Day weekend), and ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse‚Äù was taken off the release calendar for now. The untitled sequel to \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" moved to March 29, 2024.\n\nWhat's on, what's off:Where are my TV shows? Frustrated viewers' guide to strike-hit, reality-filled fall season\n\nWhen will 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'NCIS' and 'SNL' come back?\n\nIf actors follow writers back to work, production could resume late this year and new TV episodes could begin airing by February. Sitcoms require a shorter production schedule, and can air three to four weeks after they're shot; dramas take longer to produce and edit. But shows like \"Grey's\" and \"NCIS\" are likely to air 10 to 13 episodes at most, compared to 18 to 22 in a typical season. \"SNL\" is written the same week it airs, so its return would be much speedier, but there's no chance its customary 21-week season would remain intact.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander and Charles Trepany, USA TODAY, and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/10/12/actors-strike-no-end-after-amptp-negotiations-talks-cut-short/71151858007/", "title": "Actors strike sees no end in sight after studio negotiations go awry", "text": "Andrew Dalton\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES ‚Äî Talks bitterly broke off between Hollywood actors and studios late Wednesday, killing any hopes that the three-month strike by performers would come to an end anytime soon.\n\nThe studios announced that they had suspended contract negotiations, saying the gap between the two sides was too great to make continuing worth it, despite an offer as good as the one that recently ended the writers strike. The actors union decried their opponents‚Äô ‚Äúbullying tactics‚Äù and said they were wildly mischaracterizing their offers.\n\nOn Oct. 2, for the first time since the strike began July 14, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists had resumed negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents studios, streaming services and production companies in strike talks.\n\nWhen negotiations resumed with writers last month, their strike ended five days later, but similar progress was not made with the actors union.\n\nThe studios walked away from talks after seeing the actors‚Äô most recent proposal on Wednesday.\n\n‚ÄúIt is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction,‚Äù the AMPTP said in a statement.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA proposal would cost companies an additional $800 million a year and create ‚Äúan untenable economic burden,‚Äù the statement said.\n\nIn a letter to members sent early Thursday, SAG AFTRA said that figure was overestimated by 60%.

Discovery and Amazon.\n\n\"We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP,\" SAG-AFTRA announced late Wednesday. \"As of 12:01 a.m. (PST) on November 9, our strike is officially over and all picket locations are suspended.\"\n\nThe deal will allow studios to resume production of TV shows and movies that has been largely shuttered for the past six months, ever since the Writers Guild of America began its own walkout on May 2.\n\nAbout 60,000 members of the union were affected by the strike. The union membership will schedule a vote in the coming days to formally authorize the deal, putting actors one step closer to stepping in front of the cameras again. It's likely that broadcast networks can salvage part of the 2023-24 TV season by airing some new episodes of scripted series as early as February, while movies can restart production to fill a depleted pipeline.\n\nAfter two and a half months of striking without negotiations, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP first met on Oct. 2, but talks fell through when the AMPTP walked away on Oct. 11.

Protections against the studios' use of Artificial Intelligence and digital replicas of actors were also among the union's priorities, but the studios initially bristled at many of the union's asks before reaching a compromise.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA statement said the contract, valued at over $1 billion, achieved pay raises, unprecedented provisions to protect members from the threat of AI, and a new \"streaming participation bonus,\" among other benefits. \"We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,\" the union's statement said. Many thousands of performers now and into the future will benefit from this work.\"\n\nThe studio group called the agreement \"a new paradigm\" and said the AMPTP \"is pleased to have reached a tentative agreement and looks forward to the industry resuming the work of telling great stories.\"\n\nFor much of the summer, actors shared the picket line with WGA members, who were on strike for 148 days. The dual actors' and writers' strikes brought Hollywood movie and TV production to a standstill throughout the summer and fall.\n\nThe WGA leadership voted Sept. 27 to affirm a deal with the AMPTP, bringing some TV shows back on air, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" daytime and late-night talk shows such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\nThe WGA congratulated SAG-AFTRA on the deal on the union's official X account, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see SAG-AFTRA members win a contract that creates new protections for performers and gives them a greater share of the immense value they create,\" the statement said.\n\nWriters strike officially endsHollywood writers ratify new contract with studios", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/07/13/sag-strike-2023-why-hollywood-actors-walked-out/70403209007/", "title": "SAG strike 2023: Hollywood actors walk, halting movie, TV production", "text": "Hollywood actors have voted to strike, joining already-striking writers in a move that shuts down the production of countless movies and TV shows.\n\n\"I went in in earnest, thinking we could avert the strike, so the gravity of this move is not lost on me,\" Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher said Thursday at a news conference in Los Angeles announcing the strike, which officially begins at midnight local time Thursday and will find actors on the picket lines Friday morning.\n\n\"We had no choice. We are the victims here, being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" she said. \"They stand on the wrong side of history. We stand in unprecedented unity. At some point the jig is up, you can‚Äôt keep being marginalized and disrespected. The business model has been changed by streaming and AI. If we don‚Äôt stand tall right now, we‚Äôll all be in jeopardy. At some point you have to say, no, we‚Äôre not going to take this anymore.\"\n\nActors strike live updates:'Shame on you!' says emotional SAG chief Fran Drescher\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2, holding out for improved payment contracts at a time when less-than-lucrative streaming deals are bumping up against the looming threat of artificial intelligence taking writers' jobs. Actors are also looking for better pay deals, especially from streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nThe strike caps a month of tense negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the major studios. On June 28, an open letter from more than 1,000 SAG members was sent to the union's leadership. The letter, signed by Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and other big stars, expressed the membership's sincere willingness to strike if they were not able to achieve all demands in a new contract.\n\nBoth sides had already extended talks by 12 days after their initial contract expired June 30.\n\nThe combined SAG and Writers Guild of America strikes mean the immediate shutdown of any TV show or movie currently in production, and includes promotional appearances ranging from red carpet walks to media junkets. While the duration of the strike is an unknown, some reports suggest studios are willing to hold out into the fall to win concessions.\n\n\"The studios are consolidating in a bid to compete with Netflix, the only one who seems ready for Hollywood's fully digital era,\" says Aymar Jean Christian, associate professor of communication studies and director of the Media and Data Equity Lab at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The streaming model is making the studios both more powerful and cost-conscious,\" he says. \"This will be a grind. Unless the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers) gives in quickly, which seems unlikely, this could be the longest production slowdown in history.‚Äù\n\nFor their part, studios shifted blame for the strike to actors for walking away from talks and said \"historic\" pay increases and other benefits had been offered. In a statement, the AMPTP said, \"This is the Union‚Äôs choice, not ours. ... Rather than continuing to negotiate, SAG-AFTRA has put us on a course that will deepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their livelihoods.\"\n\nExplainer:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows\n\nThis marks the first time in 63 years that both Hollywood actors and writers have been on strike simultaneously. Commercial actors last walked off the job for six months in 2000, while the last strike by film and theatrical actor members of SAG lasted 14 hours, back in 1986. The writers staged a 100-day walkout in 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe ongoing Writers Guild strike has meant that many TV shows and movies have had to cancel production, although animation (minus voice actors), reality TV and some projects shooting outside the U.S. with actors who aren't in SAG have been able to carry on. But with an actors' strike, very little can continue.\n\nFor movie theaters, already facing an uphill climb after the pandemic and a shift to at-home viewing, it means another big financial challenge after they're run through their supply of already-shot movies.\n\nStrike rules forbid actors from promoting their projects, a constraint writers have faced since May. That means no premieres, no talk show appearances and no glossy magazine cover stories that aren't already banked. (USA TODAY's interviews with actors for upcoming movies such as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were conducted before the strike began.)\n\nThe strike will also depress the fun at fan favorite events such as San Diego Comic-Con, usually chock-full of popular actors, writers and directors pitching their movies and TV shows to thousands of cosplaying admirers.\n\nThe Emmy Awards, planned for Sept. 18 on Fox, would likely be delayed until both strikes are resolved. If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), other major awards shows like the Oscars would be put on hold.\n\nThe actors will join the writers on picket lines at a transformational moment in the entertainment industry. The WGA is asking for a guaranteed minimum number of writing staffers, increased royalties for streaming TV shows and movies, and the regulated use of AI. Actors share many of the same concerns and demands.\n\nThe studios reached a deal with a third major Hollywood union, the Directors Guild of America, that was ratified by its membership on June 24. But that settlement did not move the writers or actors toward an agreement with the studios.\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt, USA TODAY\n\nA movie fan's guide to the strike:Wait, will 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' come out?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/04/13/writers-strike-hollywood-2023-wga-contract-explained/11634717002/", "title": "Writers strike 2023 explained: Why and what it means for TV, film", "text": "Hollywood writers have left their keyboards behind.\n\nAt 12:01am Tuesday, the Writers Guild of America, the union representing most of Hollywood's scribes behind your favorite TV shows and films, went on strike. The board of directors for the WGA, which includes both a West and an East branch, voted unanimously to strike after talks between the guild and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the nine largest studios, failed to reach a contract. Writers, they said, are facing an \"existential crisis.\"\n\nIf it feels like a TV repeat, that's because it's all happened before. For 100 days in 2007 and 2008, writers went on strike, bringing the entertainment industry to a halt. Now those behind everything from network series like CBS' \"NCIS\" to Marvel movies to streaming series including Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" will hit the picket lines for the first time in 15 years.\n\nLatest strike updates:Hollywood writers, slamming 'gig economy,' go on strike\n\nHollywood haschanged significantly since 2008, led by the rise of streaming services. This has upended the traditional pay structure in the industry and, as the WGA argues, has led more writers longer for less pay (streaming series often have longer production schedules but fewer episodes per season, which is how their pay is calculated). At the same time, entertainment conglomerates are seeing financial losses, cutting jobs and have been shelving TV shows and movies.\n\nWe answer every question about the strike.\n\nWhy did the WGA go on strike?\n\nWriters are primarily looking for more compensation, with many pointing to the rise of streaming as having a negative effect on their earnings. In TV, writers are often paid per episode, and where a broadcast series once produced 22 or more installments each season, streaming series are more typically eight to 13 episodes.\n\nResiduals or royalties, which earn writers, actors and producers (among others) money after a TV show's debut when it airs or streams elsewhere, are lower for streaming shows than for broadcast shows that air reruns on cable or syndication.These lower minimums were established when streaming was in its infancy, and because streamers often insist on exclusivity, limiting the distribution of their shows elsewhere. In their pattern of demands, the guild also asked studios to standardize compensation forscreenwriting ‚Äì regardless of whether a film is released theatrically or on streaming ‚Äì and increase studio contributions to the pension plan and health fund.\n\nWhat about my favorite TV shows?How the writers strike will shut down some TV, but not all\n\nIn a statement announcing the strike, the WGA said, \"The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing ... They have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\"\n\nMembers of the guild tweeted details of the negotiations, including the AMPTP's counteroffers and outright rejections of many proposals, including setting a minimum number of writers to staff a show.\n\nWhy did the studios reject WGA proposals?\n\nThe studios approached the negotiations with \"the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,\" AMPTP said in a statement shortly before the talks began, and it has been a shaky time in the industry. Entertainment conglomerates and streaming services are looking to bolstertheir bottom lines, ratcheting back a spending spree on new content that has hurt profits. Many have reported losses from streaming to Wall Street in recent months and made plans to lay off thousands of employees.\n\nThe AMPTP said it presented \"a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild (April 30) which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals. The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.\"\n\nWhat TV shows and movies will be affected by a writers strike?\n\nViewers will first notice the effects on daytime and late-night talk shows, from \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Topical talk shows depend on writers and tape shows the day they air. So a strike immediately forces a shutdown.NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is also done for the remainder of the season, as three May episodes will be canceled. (The May 6 show was already being written for host Pete Davidson).Daytime soap operas also will run out of new episodes within a few weeks.\n\nMore:Is your favorite network TV show renewed, canceled or ‚Äòon the bubble‚Äô? Our 2023 status report\n\nMost broadcast shows, such as NBC's \"Law & Order\" and ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" will finish their seasons; their finale episodes have already been written and filmed. But a prolonged strike could affect how soon they return in the fall. (A handful, including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" already produced episodes for next season in preparation for a strike.) Streaming shows operate with far longer lead times, meaning the delays caused by any work stoppage won't be felt for months. But it's uncertain whether actors (also unionized in the Screen Actors Guild) would agree to film projects from already completed scripts during a strike.\n\nMovies have an even longer lag time, so titles set to release in 2024 and 2025 are most likely to be affected by a strike, forcing delays.\n\nThe longer thestrike goes on, the more studios, streamers and networks will draw programming from non-WGA sources: Reality shows and foreign TV. During the 2007-08 strike, there was a boom in reality shows that lasted long after the writers returned to work.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/09/hollywood-actors-strike-is-done-when-you-can-expect-tv-and-movies-back/71502956007/", "title": "SAG strike is over, but what's next? Here's when you can expect ...", "text": "The Hollywood strikes are officially over.\n\nNow that the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) has announced a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, actors are just one step away from getting back to work. If, as widely expected, the union membership votes to authorize the deal the cameras can start rolling again.\n\nOr can they? Scripted projects in Hollywood have been almost entirely shut down since May when the Writers Guild of America went on strike and was soon followed by SAG-AFTRA in July (the writers strike ended in October). Starting production again isn‚Äôt as simple as the actors showing up to work. TV series and movies require a lot of preparation before shooting happens, from scriptwriting to set building and costume design. Once all that preproduction work is done, there will be a scramble to get every show and film back to set at once, which could cause traffic jams at major filming locations and a greater demand for behind-the-scenes crew than can be met.\n\nSo what happens now that the strikes are over? And what does it mean for fans of TV and film? We answer your burning questions about a post-strike Hollywood. Spoiler alert: You‚Äôre still going to have to wait a while for some of your favorite series and movies.\n\nNow that the actors and writers strikes are over, when will my broadcast TV shows come back?\n\nNetwork TV may move fast, but it will still be a while until you see new episodes of most scripted series on the likes of ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS.\n\nAlthough writers have been back at work churning out scripts since early October, the holiday season is looming fast, and traditionally the town shuts down in December. The traditional network TV season, which began Sept. 25 with reality competitions, game shows, reruns and imports, will be back to normal sometime this spring, likely in late February or early March. Shows like ‚ÄúAbbott Elementary,‚Äù ‚ÄúNCIS‚Äù and ‚ÄúChicago Fire‚Äù will have shortened seasons of 10 to 13 episodes; their finales may extend into June from the traditional end of the season in mid-May. And some new shows planned for last fall will likely be pushed into the 2024-25 season.\n\nWhat about streaming and cable series? When will they be back?\n\nStreaming services and cable networks have a much longer lead time for their shows, so you may not even have noticed the subtle decline in the number of premiering shows (some due to a profit-driven cutback in what was known as \"Peak TV\"). But the pipeline has already started to dry up. Many streamers and networks have delayed the release of completed series (like FX's ‚ÄúFargo‚Äù) to stretch out their schedule and fill gaps. Expect a gap in new shows in early 2024, reflecting the prolonged strike.\n\nThe gaps will keep coming and make a very lean year in 2024 as production slowly ramps up. The wait times will be long for some highly anticipated titles. Big, expensive productions like ‚ÄúStranger Things,‚Äù which was due to start filming its fifth and final season just after the writers strike started, was already going to take a very long time. The sci-fi series requires complex post-production work, including computer-generated effects, so we might not see its new season until 2025.\n\nWhat about the movies delayed by the writers and actors strikes?\n\nSeveral movies and awards shows have been pushed back by the strikes, with some films delayed by years.\n\nDisney postponed the release of the next three installments of James Cameron's blockbuster \"Avatar\" series: ‚ÄúAvatar 3‚Äù moves to Dec. 19, 2025, ‚ÄúAvatar 4‚Äù to Dec. 21, 2029, and ‚ÄúAvatar 5‚Äù to Dec. 19, 2031. Marvel has reshuffled its cinematic universe, with ‚ÄúCaptain America: Brave New World‚Äù moving to July 26, \"Thunderbolts\" pushing back to Dec. 20, 2024, and ‚ÄúBlade‚Äù moving to Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nAside from delaying \"Dune 2,\" Warner Bros. has moved \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" a month later, to April 12, 2024, while animated \"Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\" is now slated for Dec. 13, 2024.\n\nSony moved ‚ÄúKraven the Hunter\" to Aug. 30, 2024 (Labor Day weekend), and ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse‚Äù was taken off the release calendar for now. The untitled sequel to \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" moved to March 29, 2024. Oscar hopefuls \"Challengers\" and \"The Bikeriders\" have also been delayed to allow actors to promote them.\n\nNow that the actors strike is ending, the delays won't be reversed, but studios will avoid further delays.\n\nIt's over!:Actors strike ends: SAG-AFTRA leadership OKs tentative deal with major Hollywood studios\n\nCan actors come back to talk shows and movie premieres?\n\nYes! During the strike SAG-AFTRA members were prohibited from promoting work for the major Hollywood studios. That meant no appearances on talk shows, podcasts or at conventions, no red carpet premieres and no interviews with the media talking about their movies and TV shows (new releases from independent studios were given a waiver by the union). Now there will be a full-court press (pun intended) by celebrities and their publicists to promote the movies and TV shows after four months. And the lineups on late-night and morning talk shows will feature more famous faces and fewer comedians you haven't heard of.\n\nWhy did the actors strike end?\n\nEver since the writers' strike concluded in October, pressure has mounted on both SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP to settle the actors' strike and get everyone back to work. It didn‚Äôt happen right away. After 2 ¬Ω months without negotiating, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP first met on Oct. 2, but talks fell through when the AMPTP walked out on Oct. 11. Bargaining resumed on Oct. 24, and finally led to a deal on Nov. 8.\n\nDuring the talks, the big points of contention were the use of artificial intelligence and ‚Äúdigital replicas‚Äù of actors; compensation for actors based on the streaming performance of their shows and movies; and a basic pay increase to keep up with inflation. In its statement announcing the settlement, SAG-AFTRA said the union achieved \"a deal of extraordinary scope that includes 'above-pattern' minimum compensation increases, unprecedented provisions for consent and compensation that will protect members from the threat of AI, and for the first time ... a streaming participation bonus.\" The AMPTP called the agreement \"a new paradigm.\"\n\nAre the Hollywood strikes really over now?\n\nWell, the two most major strikes are over, yes, but are all strikes done for good? Probably not.\n\nSAG-AFTRA and the WGA have contracts in place for the next three years, but when those are about to expire expect a new round of negotiations. It‚Äôs impossible to predict if it will get to the point of striking again.\n\nAnd they aren‚Äôt the only two unions in Hollywood. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees represents many behind-the-scenes crew members and technicians, and its contract with the AMPTP expires in 2024.\n\nContributing: Gary Levin , USA TODAY.\n\n'Let's go!':Hollywood celebrates end of actors' strike on red carpets and social media", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/07/13/what-sag-aftra-actors-strike-means-hollywood-movies-tv/70410249007/", "title": "What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves ...", "text": "Hollywood actors have joined writers in a strike that will bring countless TV and movie productions to a grinding halt.

Their fear is such technology could be called in to supplement or substitute for human writers.\n\nHollywood actors who are members of the Screen Actors Guild have gone on strike seeking better compensation at a time when incomes are threatened by everything from streaming service deals to nascent artificial intelligence.\n\nHow will the Screen Actors Guild strike affect my favorite shows and movies?\n\nThe ongoing Writers Guild strike has meant that many TV shows and movies have had to cancel production, although some production continued without writers on set. But an actors' strike means very little can continue. Animation (minus voice actors), reality TV and some projects shooting outside the U.S. with actors who aren't in SAG will be able to carry on.\n\nTV series will be forced into an indefinite hiatus, and movies will immediately go dark.\n\nPlan on seeing a lot of reruns on TV.

If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), other major awards shows like the Oscars would be put on hold.\n\nWhat do actors want?\n\nWhile we're all familiar with the mega-millions pay days for A-list stars such as Tom Cruise, most actors do not make that kind of money. SAG members say they are striking for an increased base compensation, regulated use of artificial intelligence, better benefit plans and money for self-taped auditions ‚Äì the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production.\n\nActors also want to be compensated for streaming TV shows and movies based on the performance of those titles. The problem there is that streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Max do not share metrics with the public, or even the creators of their films and TV shows. SAG is pushing for analytics from a third party to help determine payment.\n\nWhat do studios want?\n\nStudio executives maintain that spending on new content to meet consumer demand has hurt profits and resulted in losses that have required the layoffs of thousands of employees.\n\nA recent Deadline report cites unnamed sources who say the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are in no rush to negotiate with writers and are hoping a prolonged paycheck drought will eventually bring them back to the bargaining table.\n\nAMPTP denied the notion of a so-called \"October surprise,\" a reference to producers being willing to wait until Halloween before negotiating with strikers. ‚ÄúThese anonymous people are not speaking on behalf of the AMPTP or member companies, who are committed to reaching a deal and getting our industry back to work,‚Äù a spokesperson for the organization said.\n\nHow long will the Hollywood strike last?\n\nThat always is an unknown. There have been strikes throughout Hollywood's century-long history. The most recent was the writer's strike of 2007, which lasted 14 weeks. In 1988, the WGA struck for 22 weeks, the longest action in its history.\n\nPast actors' guild strikes included a six-week walkout in 1960, which was led by its then-president, and future U.S. president, Ronald Reagan. A 1980 strike lasted three months, while a 1986 strike, the most recent until now, lasted 14 hours.\n\nThere was one directors' guild strike in 1987, and it lasted just three hours. In early June, the Directors Guild of America reached an agreement with studios for new film and TV contracts, avoiding the prospect of an unprecedented three-guild strike.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/07/13/sag-aftra-actors-strike-2023-live-updates/70410271007/", "title": "SAG-AFTRA strike: Hollywood actors hit picket lines in labor dispute", "text": "Hollywood actors are about to be off the job and on the picket line.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), the union that represents American film and TV actors, announced plans for a strike beginning at midnight PDT Thursday, a work stoppage that will essentially bring most movie and TV production worldwide to a halt.\n\nThe announcement comes 12 hours after the contract between the union and the major studios expired without a new deal. Much of Hollywood has already shut down because of an ongoing writers strike that began May 2, but more productions would pause in an actors strike, from highly anticipated sequel films (‚ÄúMission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 2‚Äù) to new TV seasons (Netflix's \"Stranger Things\").\n\n\"We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said, announcing strike plans. \"You are systematically trying to figure out ways to carve us out of what is due us. Shame on you!\"\n\nHere are the latest updates from SAG, the studios and major celebrities as the labor battle goes on.\n\nWho will feel the impact of an actors' strike?\n\n\"I think it's gonna impact everybody,\" said Natalia Castellanos (\"Bosch\"), an actor and member of the union's negotiating committee, outside a press conference called to announce the strike. \"Me personally, I won't have any work, so no income coming in, and that's scary.\" ‚Äì Charlie Trepany\n\nStrike causes a wave of San Diego Comic-Con cancellations\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con, a late July fan event that's usually chock full of A-list actors, directors and writers hawking their upcoming films and shows to costume-clad fans, will be a muted affair this year. Planned panels were already cut back by the writers strike in May, and on Thursday the Comic-Con website kept a running list of panels and events canceled after the SAG news. Among them were a \"Good Omens\" autograph signing and a \"That '70s Show\" 25th anniversary panel.\n\nMatt Damon says middle-class actors are hardest hit\n\nMatt Damon, a star of the upcoming film \"Oppenheimer,\" was among the last to appear on a red carpet, hours before the strike was called. He defended fellow actors in an interview with the Associated Press, and said fair royalty payments are a lifeline for average working actors.\n\n\"We got to protect the people who are kind of on the margins. 26,000 bucks a year is what you have to make to get your health insurance. And there are a lot of people (for) who residual payments carry them across that threshold. If those residual payments dry up, so does their healthcare, and that's absolutely unacceptable.\" ‚Äì Erin Jensen\n\nWhat happens now that a strike has been called?\n\nExpect to see some of your favorite actors marching with picket signs, rather than promoting their movies and TV shows, especially in Los Angeles and New York, starting Friday. Since much of the entertainment business was already crippled by the writers' strike, the movie pipeline will eventually dry up ‚Äì though fans won't notice until at least 2024 ‚Äí and TV has already turned to a heavier diet of reality shows to fill the void. Streaming services operate with longer lead times than traditional TV networks, so they will have a steadier supply of new series, for now. But some may stockpile shows and spread them over a longer period to fill expected gaps. ‚Äì Gary Levin\n\nHere‚Äôs what actors can't do while on strike\n\nActors cannot do any work while on strike, which means no filming on new movies and TV shows. But it goes beyond that: They can‚Äôt audition for future projects or promote others that were already completed under the expired contract, at conventions, premieres or on social media. That means Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are off the press trail for ‚ÄúBarbie,‚Äù and the cast of ‚ÄúSuccession‚Äù won‚Äôt be campaigning for Emmy Awards. Actors won‚Äôt be giving new glossy magazine cover interviews or go on ABC's ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù to talk about new movies. And the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, for which nominations were announced Wednesday, will likely be postponed from a planned Sept. 18 airdate to as late as January, joining a crowded field in awards season.\n\nAMPTP responds to SAG strike\n\n\"AMPTP member companies entered the negotiations with SAG-AFTRA with the goal of forging a new, mutually beneficial contract,\" the organization said in a press release sent at the start of SAG-AFTRA's press conference. \"The AMPTP presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal. A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life.\"\n\nEmotional SAG chief Fran Drescher officially calls a strike: 'This is a moment of history'\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Drescher and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland announced that the organization‚Äôs board had unanimously voted for the television and theatrical division of the union to strike, and for members to \"withhold their labor\" until a fair contract can be achieved. The strike will begin at midnight tonight, and picket lines will be set up Friday morning.\n\n\"The eyes of the world and particularly the eyes of labor are upon us. What happens here is important because what is happening to us is happening across all fields of labor,\" Drescher said. \"Because at some point the jig is up. You cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized and disrespected and dishonored. The entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI. This is a moment of history. This is a moment of truth. If we don‚Äôt stand tall right now we are all going to be in trouble, we are all going to be in danger of being replaced by machines.\"\n\nThe announcement comes 12 hours after SAG-AFTRA‚Äôs contract expired with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios. This means actors in the union will not be able to film TV shows and movies, audition for new projects or promote their finished work.\n\nWhat is the AMPTP?\n\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is an organization that represents the major Hollywood studios and streamers including Warner Bros., Paramount, Netflix, Disney and others. The AMPTP bargains on behalf of those studios with the major entertainment guilds including SAG-AFTRA, the WGA and the Directors Guild of America (DGA). When Drescher and Crabtree negotiate on behalf of SAG, they are meeting with members of the AMPTP on the other side of the table.\n\n‚ÄòOppenhemier‚Äô and ‚ÄòBarbie‚Äô stars walk red carpet just before strike is called, Nolan says actors are ‚Äòwriting picket signs‚Äô\n\nThe strike means that actors have to stop all of their work, including promoting their upcoming films and movies. But the stars of highly anticipated movies \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" both due in theaters July 21, were able to squeeze in a premiere before the strike was formally called. \"Barbie\" stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling walked the pink carpet in Los Angeles last weekend. And just hours before SAG announced the strike, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh promoted \"Oppenheimer\" at a premiere in London.\n\nThe \"Oppenheimer\" actors were asked by reporters about the impending strike. \"Nobody wants a work stoppage,\" Damon told Deadline, \"but if our leadership is saying that the deal isn't fair, then we gotta hold strong till we get a deal that's fair for working actors. It's the difference between having healthcare and not for a lot of actors, and we've gotta do what's right by them.\"\n\nBlunt said the cast would leave the premiere together if a strike was called. \"We‚Äôre going to have to,\" she told Deadline. \"Oppenheimer\" director Christopher Nolan introduced the screening of his film by saying the cast had indeed left the premiere to go \"write their picket signs\" and join the fight with the guilds.\n\nDisney CEO says guilds are 'disruptive' and 'dangerous'\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger didn‚Äôt mince words when appearing on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Thursday morning, saying writers‚Äô and actors‚Äô demands were unrealistic.\n\n\"It's very disturbing to me,\" he told host David Faber when asked about the WGA strike and impending SAG strike. \"This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption. I understand any labor organizations‚Äô desire to work on the behalf of its members to get, you know, the most compensation and to be compensated fairly based on the value that they deliver. ... There's a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic. And they are adding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive and dangerous.\"\n\nThe skinny:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe expected strike comes in the middle of a long WGA strike and after a month of contentious talks between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP, and a 12-day extension of the existing contract. But the conversation around the negotiations became increasingly acrimonious during the 12-day extension. When a contract was not reached by midnight on Wednesday, and the negotiating committee recommended the board call for a strike, it became a foregone conclusion that actors would take a major labor action.\n\nDuring the press conference Drescher said that during the 12-day extension, the AMPTP remained \"behind closed doors\" and intractable on points of negotiations, and that SAG felt \"disrespected.\" She used the word \"disgusting\" more than once to describe the offer from the AMPTP.\n\nWhy are actors striking?\n\nAt stake for the actors are how much they get paid in a streaming-service-dominated industry and how artificial intelligence will be used in Hollywood as this technology radically changes our world. They want more money, regulated use of AI, and for their compensation to be based on how well their shows and movies perform on streaming services.\n\nReaction:Matt Damon, Jamie Lee Curtis, more stars share their thoughts on the actors strike\n\nHas SAG ever gone on strike?\n\nYes, but not for some time. The last time any actors went on strike was in 2000, when commercial actors walked out for six months. Theatrical and TV actors were last on strike for just 14 hours in 1986, and they also went on strike for three months in 1980.\n\nThe last time actors and writers were on strike at the same time was in 1960, when Ronald Reagan was the president of SAG and Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}]}

Only medical cannabis was legal in Minnesota during the post-2014 portion of the study.\n\nThe participants, many of whom were born in Colorado and Minnesota but had since relocated, were surveyed pre- and post-2014 on how many days they used cannabis in the last six months, and scientists initially found there was about a 24% increase in usage in states that legalized recreational cannabis compared with ones that did not. Based on where respondents were living at the time of the surveys, nearly every state was represented, along with Washington, DC and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe study included 111 pairs of identical twins as well, with one twin living in a state that legalized recreational cannabis and the other in a state that did not legalize it. Among the identical twins, researchers found the usage increased about 20% in states that legalized recreational cannabis compared with ones that did not.\n\nSince identical twins share so many similarities, that percentage is a more accurate estimate of the causal influence of cannabis legalization on cannabis use, said lead study author Stephanie Zellers, now a researcher at the University of Helsinki in Finland.\n\nIdentical twins share the same genes and often the same type of upbringing, both of which could influence how frequently someone uses cannabis, said Zellers, who was a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Minnesota at the time of the project.\n\n‚ÄúBecause that 20% estimate is from the analysis controlling for measured and unmeasured variables,‚Äù Zellers said, ‚Äúit is the most precise estimate of the causal influence of cannabis legalization on cannabis use.‚Äù\n\nDispensaries in Colorado may make it easier for people to purchase recreational cannabis. Joe Amon/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nMany states that like Colorado, have legal recreational cannabis also have an ample number of dispensaries, so it‚Äôs easy to make purchases, a factor that could have contributed to the higher usage rate, Zellers said.\n\nNo legal consequences such as fines or jail time also could affect the increased use in recreational states, she added.\n\n‚ÄúAdditionally, the existence of recreational policies influences the perception of cannabis use,‚Äù Zellers said, ‚Äúmaking it viewed as more safe and less stigmatized.‚Äù\n\nHow legalization affects usage\n\nAs more states legalize recreational cannabis use, it‚Äôs important to recognize how that legalization affects consumption, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n‚ÄúThis knowledge can be used to inform strategies for implementing legalization while minimizing the potential harms,‚Äù said Volkow, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe statistics could also help researchers understand how recreational use affects the rate of cannabis addiction, she said.\n\nAbout 30% of people who use marijuana in the United States have cannabis use disorder, the official term for marijuana addiction, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn states where recreational use is legal, advertisements often label the drug as safe, Volkow said.\n\nMore research needs to be done on how safe cannabis is and its impact on the body before people jump to conclusions on safety, she said.\n\nIt‚Äôs not black and white\n\n‚ÄúPeople often want to say that cannabis is either all good or all bad,‚Äù Volkow said. ‚ÄúBut in biology, nothing is black and white ‚Äì there is a lot of gray.‚Äù\n\nFrequent or prolonged cannabis use is associated with health conditions such as chronic bronchitis and schizophrenia, she said.\n\nHowever, usage has also been shown to be effective at treating some pain conditions such as nausea and vomiting, Volkow said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPeople only saw mild to moderate pain relief with prescription-strength cannabis products and no benefits from over-the-counter cannabis drugs, according to a study published in June in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nZellers said she hopes to conduct further research into the effects of increased cannabis use on conditions such as mental health and addiction.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2016/01/04/24-7-wallst-legalize-marijuana/78077366/", "title": "11 states least likely to legalize marijuana", "text": "Sam Stebbins and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nIllegal in the United States for nearly 80 years, marijuana accounted for 8.2 million arrests nationwide between 2001 and 2010. Despite the decades old federal ban, the country's attitude toward marijuana has been changing. While only 12% of Americans supported legalizing pot in 1969, 58% of Americans supported an end to marijuana prohibition in 2013.\n\nStarting with California in 1996, medicinal marijuana use is now legal in 23 states. Of the states with laws protecting medicinal users, four have legalized recreational pot use as well. Despite evolving opinions among voters and legislators, some states still seem unlikely to pass any kind of meaningful reform in the near future. Based on a review of marijuana laws and penalties for possession, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 11 least likely states to legalize marijuana.\n\nIn all of the states least likely to legalize pot, possession is a felony under certain circumstances. Perhaps due to strict penalties, estimated usage rates are below average in these states. While an estimated 12.3% of Americans age 12 years and older smoke marijuana, usage rates in all of the states least likely to legalize pot are below the national rate. In Kansas, for example, one of the least pot friendly states in the country, only 8.2% of residents 12 years and older use marijuana, the smallest share of any state in the country.\n\nThe Next 11 States to Legalize Marijuana\n\nAccording to Mason Tvert, director of communications with the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), legal repercussions are not the only factor explaining the relatively low marijuana usage in these states. \"There is little doubt marijuana prohibition laws are deterring many adults from choosing to use marijuana,\" Tvert said. However, a range of cultural factors, from historical immigration patterns to how religious a population is, also come into play, he noted.\n\nAll of the states least likely to legalize pot tend towards the conservative end of the political spectrum. In the 2012 presidential election, all of the states on this list voted for the conservative candidate. Tvert explained that each state's history feeds into and partially explains its current culture and attitude. For example, though federal alcohol prohibition ended in 1933 with the 21st amendment, Oklahoma did not repeal prohibition laws until 1959, more than a quarter of a century later. Since marijuana has been illegal for the entirety of most people's lives, \"it makes them hesitant to make significant changes to marijuana policies,\" Tvert said.\n\nWhile marijuana policy is largely a social issue, it is also an economic one. Extrapolating from tax dollars already collected from the legally regulated marijuana sales in Colorado, the Anderson Economic Group (AEG) estimates that national excise tax revenue could be as high $3.1 billion with prohibition repeal. While nationwide legalization would certainly provide a lucrative stream of new tax revenue, it could also cannibalize major existing industries. According to the same report by AEG, a nationwide repeal of marijuana prohibition could result in a $221.4 million annual decrease in alcohol sales.\n\nThe Drunkest City in Each State\n\nAs more states decriminalize and legalize marijuana, federal law is more likely to change. Tvert said, \"with social issues like this we tend to see an evolution take place, we tend to see dominoes fall and the pace will continue to pick up.\" In other words, national marijuana law reform will become increasingly more likely as more states join legalize recreational pot and join the ranks of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.\n\nTo identify the last states that will legalize marijuana, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed states with the harshest marijuana laws. We only considered states where medical marijuana, with the exception of cannabis oil to treat epilepsy, is not permitted. Felony charges also needed to be possible for merely possessing the plant under certain circumstances in these states. Since marijuana law reform could be imminent even in the states with the harshest laws, we also excluded states where voter initiatives are scheduled for the near future as well as states where pro-marijuana legislation has gained support in recent months. Marijuana-related arrests per 100,000 residents through 2012 in each state came from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. In addition, we considered the estimated proportion of residents 12 years and older who reported using marijuana some time in the past year based on annualized data from 2012 and 2013, from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The Marijuana Policy Project provided public opinion polls based on the most recent available survey. All data on current enforcement policies and penalties were provided by NORML.\n\nThese are the last states that will legalize marijuana.\n\n1. Alabama\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $6,000\n\n>Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 3,600\n\n>Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 74.7\n\n>Minimum penalty classification: Misdemeanor\n\nMarijuana use among Alabama residents is relatively rare. Roughly 9.7% of residents 12 years and older report using the drug, one of the lowest usage rates among all states and significantly lower than the national usage rate of 12.3%. Low useage may be the result of steep legal penalties for possession. Even after a reduction in the severity of the penalties earlier this year, second time offenders caught with any amount of marijuana face felony charges and up to five years incarceration.\n\nNot all marijuana legislation introduced to the state legislature this year was signed into law. The senate killed a bill that would have established a medicinal marijuana program. With harsh possession penalties, low usage rates, and a demonstrable lack of political support, Alabama is among the least likely states to legalize marijuana in the near future.\n\n2. Arkansas\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $2,500\n\n>Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 5,892\n\n>Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 199.8\n\n>Minimum penalty classification: Misdemeanor\n\nArkansas has a voter initiative process, and as Tvert explained, this could put progressive marijuana reform on the table in the near future. However, the state is still an unlikely place for full legalization. In 2012, voters in Arkansas did not pass a measure that would have allowed seriously ill residents to use medicinal marijuana without fear of legal repercussion. Two years later, after falling short by about 11,500 signatures of the 62,507 required, a proposal to legalize recreational use of the drug failed to even make it on the ballot. having a A reluctance to legalize marijuana in Arkansas may not be especially surprising as nearly half of all counties in the state ban alcohol sales.\n\nPossession of four ounces or more in Arkansas is a felony punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Second time offenders in Arkansas will face felony charges for possession of as little as a single ounce. Prosecuting and arresting marijuana offenders is a strain on state resources. There were 5,324 arrests in 2012 for marijuana possession alone. According to the MPP, 91% of burglaries in the state and more than 90% of all motor vehicle thefts went unsolved in the same year, an indication resources allocated to crimes relating to marijuana may be better used elsewhere.\n\n3. Georgia\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $1,000\n\n>Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 30,611\n\n>Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 308.6\n\n>Minimum penalty classification: Misdemeanor\n\nDespite recent legalization of non-psychoactive cannabis oil for medicinal purposes, marijuana legalization seems unlikely in the near future for residents of the Peach State. Even those who are prescribed cannabis oil for specific medical treatment face potential legal risks. Georgia currently does not allow for the production or distribution of the medicinal oil in the state, leaving patients little choice but to travel across state lines to obtain the medicine, a direct violation of federal law. While laws regarding the drug's medical use will remain strict, some legislators along with the majority of voters, support allowing cannabidiol to be produced and distributed within state borders.\n\nAn adult in Georgia caught in possession of more than 1 ounce of marijuana can face felony charges, a $5,000 fine, and a minimum of one year incarceration. Marijuana arrests are more common in Georgia than they are in most other states. There are roughly 309 marijuana-related arrests for every 100,000 state residents, significantly more than the corresponding national rate of 239 arrests for every 100,000 people.\n\nMORE:See the rest of the top 11 states least likely to legalize marijuana\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

John Carney on Friday said he would let bills to legalize marijuana and create a recreational industry become law without his signature, standing down from his opposition to recreational weed that put him at odds with his party.\n\nDelaware is the 22nd state to legalize recreational marijuana, marking a milestone in President Joe Biden's home state after a nearly decades-long fight by advocates and Democrats to loosen restrictions on marijuana.\n\nCarney, in a statement, said he still believes legalizing weed is ‚Äúnot a step forward.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI want to be clear that my views on this issue have not changed,‚Äù the governor said in a statement.\n\n‚ÄúI came to this decision because I believe we‚Äôve spent far too much time focused on this issue, when Delawareans face more serious and pressing concerns every day. It‚Äôs time to move on.‚Äù\n\nRecreational weed becomes legal Sunday\n\nCarney said he could not sign the bills because of his concerns about consequences recreational marijuana will have on children's health, as well as roadway safety. Along with Delaware House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, the governor is the rare Democrat to oppose weed legalization.\n\n‚ÄúI recognize that many legislators disagree ‚Äì and I respect the legislative process,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI also do not believe prolonging debate on this issue best serves Delawareans.‚Äù\n\nMarijuana, in the quantity of personal use, becomes legal starting Sunday. Delawareans will be allowed to smoke joints, eat gummies and consume weed as they wish in private.It will still be illegal to consume marijuana in public, and employers are still allowed to have a zero-tolerance policy. Recreational weed will not be available for purchase in the state for at least 16 months.\n\nLike it has in neighboring states, a Delaware recreational marijuana industry could bring in tens of millions in tax revenue.\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly in March passed two marijuana-related bills: House Bill 1 legalizes the \"personal use quantity\" of marijuana, which varies by cannabis form, for people ages 21 and older. This is defined as 1 ounce or less of leaf marijuana, 12 grams or less of concentrated cannabis, or cannabis products containing 750 milligrams or less of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.\n\nThe second bill, House Bill 2, creates and regulates the recreational marijuana industry in Delaware. Within 16 months of the legislation going into effect, the state will distribute 30 retail licenses through a competitive bidding process.\n\nThere will be a marijuana-control enforcement fee of 15% on recreational sales. This money, lawmakers say, will create grants and services that focus on restorative justice and reducing the state‚Äôs prison population.\n\nAdvocates applauds marijuana legalization\n\nLaura Sharer, Delaware NORML executive director, said \"Delaware lawmakers have taken a progressive and equitable approach to cannabis policy.\"\n\n‚ÄúThis is a significant step towards creating a fair system that respects personal freedom, promotes public health and safety, generates economic growth and addresses social justice issues,\" she said.\n\nCarney, in his statement, said he would ensure that Delaware has a ‚Äúrobust regulatory system that protects the interests of the most vulnerable Delawareans, to avoid the many challenges we‚Äôve seen in other states, and to get back to focusing on issues that are most important for Delaware families.‚Äù\n\nThe governor was sent the bills last week, starting a 10-day clock for him to make a decision on the future of the bills. He had three options: sign, veto or do nothing, which would allow it to become law.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar legalization bill, resulting in a rare and historic moment for lawmakers: They attempted to override. A successful veto override hasn‚Äôt been done since 1977. And it‚Äôs rarely attempted.\n\n'We've reached the mountaintop'\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly has been hesitant to take on the governor, especially when he is a member of their own party. So, despite the attempt last year, many lawmakers who supported the bill acquiesced.\n\nYet this year appeared to be different. The bills sponsor Rep Ed. Osienski, a Newark Democrat, said last week that he had the votes for successful overrides on both bills.\n\n\"I do think the temperature is different,\" Osienski said. \"I think my colleagues have been through that once. And they heard about it from their constituents.\"\n\nOsienski, in a statement, said he will work with the Carney administration to ensure the regulatory process goes smoothly. He credited the governor for \"listening to the thousands of residents who support this effort and allowing it to become law.\" He also thanked advocates for, in the last five years, being \"patient as we negotiated, poked, prodded and cajoled our way to gaining enough support to pass the Marijuana Control Act.\"\n\n\"We‚Äôve reached the mountaintop, and it feels great to finally get there,\" he said. \"I hope everyone enjoys the moment.‚Äù", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/24/state-issue-2-ohios-ballot-issue-on-marijuana-legalization-november-2023-election-results/70672594007/", "title": "State Issue 2: Ohio's ballot issue on marijuana legalization", "text": "Ohioans will vote on a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana on Nov. 7.\n\nThe statute, if passed, would legalize, regulate and tax adult-use marijuana in addition to the current medical cannabis program.

Frohlich and Michael B. Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nMarijuana prohibition is entering its 78th year. Colorado's marijuana law went into effect at the beginning of last year in the wake of changing attitudes. Compared to 1969, when only 12% supported legalizing pot, today a majority of Americans support legalizing recreational use of the drug.\n\nIt is legal to purchase marijuana in four states ‚Äî Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington ‚Äî as well as in the District of Columbia. Prior to the legalization, all of these states had already reduced the penalties for possession and use of small amounts of the drug or introduced policies permitting medical marijuana use. To identify the states most likely to legalize marijuana next, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 11 states where by law residents in possession of small amounts of the drug are not punishable by jail time, and medical marijuana use is permitted.\n\nA large share of U.S. states, including all 11 on this list, have decriminalized marijuana at some point. The widely-referenced, but confusing term actually means a different thing depending on where it is being used. Not to be confused with legalization, states that have decriminalized marijuana have in some way reduced the penalties for for those caught with the substance. In most cases, this means the state will no longer prosecute or jail those caught with small amounts of the drug for personal use. In some cases, getting caught with a few grams of marijuana is as serious as a traffic infraction.\n\nOther states that have decriminalized, however, still have relatively harsh penalties for possession. In Nevada, for example, the state no longer can assign jail time for those caught with a small amount of the drug, but violators can still be arrested, fined heavily, and charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nVarious moral and practical arguments have helped to catalyze the growing trend of legalization and decriminalization of marijuana. The potential tax revenue, job creation, and reduction of the burden of offenders on state prison systems, for example, have likely been a motivating factor behind the bills to regulate and legalize the drug in many of the states on our list. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Allen St. Pierre, executive director at the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), argued that legalizing marijuana \"would generate revenue where we now hemorrhage out billions and billions of dollars.\"\n\nHowever, according to Morgan Fox, communications manager at the Marijuana Policy Project, the most significant force in getting bills and referendums on the table is public support within the states. In most of the 11 states that may soon legalize marijuana, recent polls have been conducted showing a majority of residents support some form of legalization. In Connecticut, 63% of those surveyed in a March 2015 Quinnipiac University poll said they were in favor of legalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana for adults.\n\nSt. Pierre argued that the current prohibition laws are inconsistent. \"If alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and pharmaceutical products can be legally sold to adults in this country, it's hard to understand the constitutional economic or for that matter moral arguments put forward on why marijuana can't be within that same ambit of choices for adults.\"\n\nOne factor that may be driving high public support for legalization in these states is the a high number of users. Of the 11 states that appear next in line to legalize marijuana, nine surpass the nationwide rate of marijuana users. In 2012 and 2013, an estimated average of 12.3% of Americans 12 and older smoked marijuana. In Rhode Island, one of the states on our list, more than 20% had.\n\nSt. Pierre also noted that the marijuana legalization issue is unique in that Americans' political persuasions favor legalization of marijuana. Support for reform can be found among liberals, but also among conservatives, particularly those with libertarian-leaning beliefs. \"It's hard to make an argument against legalization in a free-market society such as ours,\" said St. Pierre.\n\nStill, according to Gallup, less than one-third of conservative Americans think cannabis should be legalized, in contrast with overwhelmingly strong support from liberals and a strong majority of moderates. Nearly all of the next states expected to legalize marijuana are liberal-leaning states.\n\nTo identify the next states to legalize marijuana, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed states where possession of small amounts of marijuana is not punishable by jail and also where medical marijuana is currently legal based on data from The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). We also considered marijuana-related arrests per 100,000 residents through 2012 provided by the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. In addition, we considered the estimated proportion of residents 12 and older who had used marijuana some time in the past year, based on annualized data from 2012 and 2013, from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Public opinion polls were provided by the Marijuana Policy Project based on the most recent available survey. All data on current enforcement policies and penalties were provided by NORML.\n\nThese are the states where marijuana is most likely to be legalized.\n\n1. Massachusetts\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $100\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 2,596\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 39}\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Civil offense\n\nUnder Massachusetts' state law, an individual can only be fined a maximum of $100 for possession an ounce or less of marijuana ‚Äî the result of a 2008 ballot to decriminalize possession of small amounts of the drug. The impact of decriminalization has been dramatic. While there were more than 10,000 marijuana-related arrests in 2008, there was just about a third as many such arrests in 2009, the first year the law took effect.\n\nThough the state's marijuana policy is relatively progressive, it appears that decriminalization has not gone far enough for the majority of voters. In a poll released last year by the Boston Herald, 53% of state residents were in favor of legalizing marijuana, while only 37% were against. Proponents of legalization may have a chance to change the state law again in November 2016. Democratic State Representative Dave Rogers and Democratic State Senator Patricia Jehlen introduced a bill to to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults.\n\nMORE: States where people drink the most beer\n\n2. Nevada\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $600\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 8,524\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 309\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Misdemeanor\n\nAccording to the Marijuana Policy Project, Nevada is one of 20 states to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. Though no one found in possession of under an ounce of the drug can face incarceration or felony charges, Nevada's penalties for possession are among the harshest of all the states that have decriminalized. Unlike some states that have decriminalized the small amounts of the drug, like Massachusetts and California, first time offenders in Nevada can still be charged with a misdemeanor and be compelled to undergo mandatory drug treatment.\n\nDespite the harsher penalties, next year Nevada could become the fifth state to legalize recreational use of drug. Voters will have a chance to pass the Initiative to Tax and Regulate Marijuana in November 2016. If passed, legalization will have a dramatic effect on arrest rates and police resources. As of 2012, there were about 8,500 marijuana-related arrests in Nevada, the 14th highest arrest rate in the country.\n\n3. California\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $100\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 21,256\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 56\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Infraction\n\nCalifornia was in the vanguard of state marijuana reforms in the 1970s and an early adopter of decriminalization. In 1996, the state passed the Compassionate Use Act, which permitted physician-recommended marijuana use for medical treatment. In 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation that reclassified the crime of marijuana possession from a misdemeanor to an infraction. Despite the state's historically progressive stance, marijuana has yet to be legalized. In 2010, a motion to legalize failed by a slim margin.\n\nTwo bills proposing marijuana regulation are now on the table, although the success of each remains to be seen. A great deal may be at stake in the success or failure of marijuana law reform in California. According to St. Pierre, because of the state's sheer size and influence, the viability of federal legislation largely relies on the precedent California might set.\n\nMORE: America's most peaceful states\n\n4.

However, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, law enforcement agencies have been abusing the \"public view\" loophole, which differentiates between where offenders are caught ‚Äî possessing a small amount of the drug in the privacy of one's home results in a fine, while possession in a public place can result in a misdemeanor. Supporting this claim is New York's extremely high marijuana-related arrest rate, which was the highest in the country in 2013 at 577.24 per 100,000 people ‚Äî more than double the national rate. However, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in 2014 that the city would no longer be enforcing the loophole.\n\nIn early July, 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a medical marijuana bill into law. There are currently two bills to legalize and tax marijuana in the legislature, which is currently on break.\n\n5. Vermont\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $200\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 926\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 148\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Civil violation\n\nAccording to a Rand research study on marijuana legalization, Vermonters consumed between 15 to 25 metric tons of marijuana, worth between $125 million and $225 million, in 2014. More than 19% of state residents 12 years and over reported using marijuana in the past year, the third highest share nationwide. Also, according to the Vermont Department of Health, marijuana consumption is more common among 12- to 17-year-olds in Vermont than in any other state in the nation.\n\nAs in every other state likely to legalize pot, possessing less than an ounce or less of the drug is not punishable by incarceration. Possessing more than an ounce, the selling of any amount, or cultivating the plant, however, is considered a misdemeanor. Selling a half ounce or more, or cultivating three or more plants, is a felony.\n\n6. Minnesota\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $200\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 12,051\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 224\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Misdemeanor\n\nThe first medical marijuana dispensary in Minnesota opened on July 1, 2015. For those who do not qualify for medicinal use of the drug, possession of 42.5 grams, roughly 1.5 ounces, or less can be classified as a misdemeanor and is punishable by a fine of up to $200.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by SAMHSA, from 2010 through 2013, Minnesota teenagers' attitudes toward occasional marijuana use have relaxed. In 2010, 70.9% of 12-17-year old state residents did not consider smoking pot once a month to be risky behavior. By 2013, 75.4% of teenagers held the same perception.\n\nThere were 12,051 marijuana-related arrests in Minnesota in 2012. The state's per capita marijuana-related arrest rate was typical for the country.\n\nMORE:How Obamacare increased coverage in every state\n\n7.

The state decriminalized marijuana use in 2011, decreeing that any possession of the substance up to a half of an ounce would have a maximum penalty of a $150 fine and could not be punishable by jail time. Before the law passed, the state's marijuana arrest rate in 2010 was 259 per 100,000 people. By 2012 the rate had dropped to just 104 such arrests per 100,000, the sixth lowest rate in the country.\n\nCurrently, the state also has several bills in the legislature that would legalize marijuana use for adult residents and regulate the industry.\n\n8. Maryland\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $100\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 22,043\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 375\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Civil offense\n\nThe recently adopted Maryland Medical Marijuana State Program permits certified physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients diagnosed with certain conditions. As a result, the state's first marijuana dispensary, Greenway Consultations, opened this past June. Still, the possession of more than 10 grams of pot is a misdemeanor in Maryland, and possession of less than 50 pounds with the intent to distribute carries a penalty of up to five years incarceration and fines up to $15,000.\n\nEven so, there is a good chance Maryland is on track to legalize the substance. Governor Larry Hogan signed a bill supported by marijuana legalization advocates during the current legislative session. The Second Chance Act, under certain circumstances, permits individuals convicted of possessing marijuana, to have their arrest shielded from some records requests. As in most states on this list, a majority of Maryland residents support the legalization of marijuana.\n\nMORE:10 states with the most gun violence\n\n9.

An estimated 20% of Rhode Islanders aged 12 and up used the drug at least once in 2012. No other state in the country had wider use.\n\nOf the states that have not legalized recreational marijuana use, Rhode Island's laws are among the most lenient. Possession of up to an ounce is a civil violation punishable by a maximum fine of $150. First time offenders do not face jail time or risk a criminal record. However, possession of amounts in excess of an ounce carry criminal penalties and potential jail time.\n\nThere is currently a bill awaiting review in the state legislature that would effectively legalize and regulate recreational use of marijuana. Though the Rhode Island legislature went on summer recess before the Marijuana Regulation, Control, and Taxation Act received final approval, lawmakers may have a chance to review the bill again before year's end. According to an April 2015 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling, 57% of respondents in the state support changing the law to regulate and tax marijuana similarly to alcohol.\n\n10. Maine\n\n> Max. fine for small amount: $600\n\n> Marijuana related arrests in 2012: 3,202\n\n> Marijuana arrests per 100,000: 241\n\n> Minimum penalty classification : Civil violation\n\nMaine has a relatively high rate of marijuana use, with an estimated 16.24% of residents 12 and older having smoked pot at least once in 2012, the seventh highest rate in the county. In 2013, Portland, the state's most populous city, voted to legalize possession of small amounts of the drug for adults. While this still goes against state policy, and law enforcement has continued to enforce Maine's prohibition of the drug, it is a sign of the public's willingness to make a change. Possession of up to 2.5 ounces of the drug in the state is not punishable by jail time, although there are maximum fines of $600 or $1,000, depending on the amount.\n\nThe state legalized medical marijuana in 1999 during a state ballot initiative ‚Äî the measure passed with 61% of the vote. Possession of a \"usable amount\" of the drug with a doctor's notice is legal. In 2009, another initiative passed to allow for medical dispensaries.\n\nMORE:The most iconic frozen treats in each state\n\n11.

Though the law will not take effect until January, when it does, Delaware residents will face a maximum penalty of a $100 fine for possession of up to an ounce of the drug. Before the governor signed the law, marijuana users in Delaware faced up to three months of jail time, a $575 fine, and a misdemeanor on their record for the same offence.\n\nThere were 2,912 marijuana-related arrests in 2012 in Delaware, the 12th highest rate of all states per capita.

Arizona, New Jersey, South Dakota and Montana all had marijuana legalization on the ballot last November and approved the measures, allowing the possession of marijuana by adults, bringing the number of states that have legalized or voted to legalize recreational weed to 15.\n\nSouth Dakota and Mississippi also passed initiatives approving medicinal use. According to NORML, a nonprofit marijuana public advocacy group, that means 36 states now permit the legal distribution of medical marijuana.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, for proponents of recreational marijuana, 2020 instead marked another year of the commonwealth being sent to the store for snacks and waiting in the car for the party to end.\n\nBut the question of whether or not it could happen in Pennsylvania is once again lingering in the air after Gov. Tom Wolf touted it as a priority in his budget proposal last month.\n\nWhen will Pennsylvania join other states that have legalized recreational marijuana?\n\nThe answer is not anytime soon. And if it does happen, expect it to be a slow burn.\n\n\"One thing that has held Pennsylvania off from this, and this is true for a lot of states, is that because there is not a statewide ballot initiative process; it has to go through the legislature,\" said Lt. Governor John Fetterman.\n\nPennsylvania is one of 24 states that do not have initiative and referendum processes that would allow citizens to vote on measures like marijuana legalization. Any change would have to go through the state Legislature.\n\nStill, things are a little different in 2021.\n\nThere‚Äôs a Democrat-controlled Congress that has been vocal about bringing change on the federal level.

About 59% of survey respondents were in support of medical and recreational use, while 32% thought it should be limited to medical use.\n\nThe rapidly shifting attitudes nationally have created a situation where Pennsylvania begins to stand out for having no level of legalization, decriminalization or regulation.\n\n\"Pennsylvania is becoming kind of an island,\" Fetterman said, referencing the changes to legalization in New Jersey.\n\nNew York is taking steps as well. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling for the legalization and regulation of marijuana for recreational use by adults, his third attempt in three years to get the drug fully legalized in the state.\n\nFetterman said being surrounded by states that have embraced some level of legalization could eventually lead to deeper discussions locally.\n\n\"I think there may be more appetite to at least consider that in the state moving forward. That said, I would expect it to be a slow process,\" he said. \"I would not expect the state Legislature at any time to say 'we're just going to legalize in Pennsylvania right now.'\"\n\nThe governor's stance\n\n\"Pennsylvania has built a successful medical marijuana program through bipartisan work,\" Wolf said in his legislative plan for 2021. \"It‚Äôs time to take the next step and legalize recreational marijuana in the commonwealth with an emphasis on helping businesses and restorative justice.\"\n\nHis budget, however, does not contain any language or concrete plans on how he would accomplish such a policy change.\n\nSince the height of the pandemic this summer, Wolf has said marijuana tax revenue could help small businesses that have been impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nMore:Gov.

All of them failed to receive a committee hearing.\n\nThe same thing happened in 2019.\n\nThe bills struggled to find GOP support in a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, things changed. State Sen. Dan Laughlin of Erie County became the first Republican in the Pennsylvania legislature to sponsor a bill that would legalize marijuana use and possession for adults 21 years and older.\n\nMore:Laughlin: PA legislation would make marijuana possession, use legal for adults 21 and older\n\nThe proposed bill would amend the Medical Marijuana Act of 2016, allowing people 21 years and older to legally possess 30 grams ‚Äî just more than one ounce ‚Äî of cannabis flower. Anyone currently serving time for non-violent marijuana offenses would be released and those convicted of low-level cannabis crimes would have those expunged from their records.\n\n\"The writing is on the wall ‚Äî legalization is going to happen in Pennsylvania sooner or later,\" Laughlin said. \"So instead of kicking and screaming, I think the right approach is to take the bull by the horns and write the legislation ourselves.\"\n\nBut other members of the GOP are still resistant to these efforts and marijuana legalization in the commonwealth.\n\n\"There is no support within our caucus to legalize recreational marijuana, especially while we are in the middle of a disaster declaration related to the opioid addiction crisis in Pennsylvania,\" said Jason Gottesman, spokesman for Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, R-Centre. \"In addition, the money that would come in from the program, as proposed by the Wolf administration, is not the alleged windfall it is made out to be and would only go to new spending.\"\n\nGottesman said there currently is no discussion among the GOP to pursue adult recreational use or legislation similar to New Jersey‚Äôs.\n\nState Rep. Keith Gillespie, a Republican representing York County, said while legalization is probably inevitable because of the number of states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, it is not something he sees happening in the immediate future.\n\nMore:Navy vet got off opioids and onto medical marijuana; and now she's denied federal housing\n\nGillespie, who has a healthcare background, referred to marijuana legalization as a \"slippery slope\" ‚Äî a gateway that could lead to increased use of illicit drugs such as heroin or cocaine, he said.\n\n\"I think I can unequivocally say it‚Äôs not going to happen in 2021. At this point, I do not think there are 102 votes in the House or 26 in the Senate, which are the magic numbers,\" Gillespie said. \"But will it be legalized in 2031? Perhaps.\"\n\nMeredith Buettner, executive director of the Pennsylvania Cannabis Coalition, said New Jersey‚Äôs move to legalize marijuana should serve as a wake-up call to Pennsylvania.\n\nShe said adult-use cannabis presents an opportunity to deliver immediate economic and social benefits to the commonwealth. By acting now, Buettner said, the Legislature could ensure that the job creation and revenue from regulating marijuana remains in Pennsylvania and does not bleed across our borders.\n\n\"Each day we wait to act results in potential revenue and investment hemorrhaging across our borders to New Jersey, and soon, New York,\" she said.\n\n\"It‚Äôs going to be the Candyland of legal weed in New Jersey,\" Fetterman echoed, \"and we‚Äôre going to lose all the revenue, jobs ‚Äî all of the opportunities ‚Äî just because a couple key leaders in the Republican Legislature won‚Äôt give the people what they want.\"\n\nFetterman believes that if the GOP got on board, Pennsylvania could legalize marijuana for adult-use in two to three months.\n\n\"A majority of their constituents want it, a super majority of Democrats want it. The only obstacle for legal weed in Pennsylvania is leadership in the House and Senate that are blocking it,\" Fetterman said. \"It‚Äôs just like stop, you‚Äôre embarrassing yourself and holding your state back.\"\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW VIDEO.\n\nCould things change on the federal level?\n\nBut a change of presidential administration means the possibility of renewed discussion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden expressed skepticism about legalization during the Democratic presidential primary, but he has also called for the decriminalization of marijuana and the expunging of convictions for marijuana use.\n\nBiden's campaign website said he supported the legalization of medical marijuana and would leave decisions on recreational use up to the states.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Sen.

What to know about recreational marijuana", "text": "Delaware became the 22nd state to legalize recreational marijuana Sunday after Gov. John Carney allowed two bills to become law without his signature.\n\nIt marks an end to a lengthy fight by Democrats to legalize the drug and create an industry with the potential to bring in tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue.\n\nBut what does that mean for Delawareans looking to purchase legal weed or get a license to sell it? We've answered some of the big questions about the future of recreational marijuana in the First State.\n\nBACKGROUND:Carney allows Delaware weed bills to become law without signature. 'It‚Äôs time to move on'\n\nWhen can I buy weed in Delaware?\n\nDelawareans will not be able to purchase recreational weed in the First State for at least 16 months.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nBuying recreational marijuana will be similar to buying alcohol. You must be at least 21 years old and have a government ID.\n\nAnyone who meets these requirements can get a predetermined \"personal use\" amount of weed: 1 ounce or less of leaf marijuana, 12 grams or less of concentrated cannabis, or cannabis products containing 750 milligrams or less of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.\n\nIt will still be illegal to consume marijuana in public, and employers can continue to enforce their own zero-tolerance drug policies.\n\nWhat if I'm currently facing charges?\n\nIt's unclear from the two bills passed what will happen to people facing charges related to marijuana.\n\nPossessing less than an ounce of marijuana has been decriminalized in Delaware since 2015. However, anyone under 21 caught with weed or with a large amount still faced charges.\n\nWhat happens to medical marijuana centers?\n\nThere will be no changes to any laws about medical marijuana, and there will not be any new taxes on it.\n\nIt is unclear whether medical marijuana centers can also apply to sell recreational marijuana or what that process would look like.\n\nHow will licenses be handed out?\n\nDelawareans can begin applying for licenses to sell, test or cultivate marijuana in 13 months, with the first licenses handed out in 14 months. Licenses will cost $10,000 every two years, and they can be taken away at any time.\n\nThe new laws also include special provisions to ensure equity in licenses. This means that people from communities disproportionately impacted by drug possession arrests or who have been arrested for lower-level drug crimes themselves will have state assistance in applying for licenses, lower fees and dedicated licenses set aside for them.\n\nWhat are the rules for transporting marijuana?\n\nYou can now drive with marijuana within Delaware, as long as it's in a sealed container and out of reach from everyone in the car. Just don't take it out of the state ‚Äî that's illegal at the federal level and can bring hefty charges.\n\nIt's also illegal to drive after consuming marijuana and runs the same penalties as drunken driving.\n\nCan I now bring marijuana in from states that already legalized it?\n\nNo. Transporting marijuana across state lines is illegal at the federal level, even between two states that have legalized it.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

So please get used to it, or stay out of football.‚Äù\n\nDario Minden was a relatively unknown German football fan before a video of a powerful speech he made was widely shared on social media in September.\n\nFor the majority of the 15-minute talk he spoke in his native German before switching to English, a change he deliberately made, he says, for impact. He wanted the world to hear.\n\nLooking directly at Qatar‚Äôs ambassador to Germany, Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud al-Thani, in a room full of dignitaries and sponsors at a human rights conference in Frankfurt, hosted by the German Football Association, he said his impactful words. Sitting in the front row, the camera pans briefly to al-Thani and shows him looking at and listening to Minden.\n\n‚ÄúFootball is for everyone,‚Äù Minden continued. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre lesbian, if you‚Äôre gay, it‚Äôs for everyone. For the boys, for the girls and for everyone in between ‚Ä¶ The rule that football is for everyone is so important. We cannot allow you to break it no matter how rich you are. You are more than welcome to join the international football community and, also, of course, to host a big tournament. But in sports, it is how it is. You have to accept the rules.‚Äù\n\nWhen Minden finishes, a sprinkling of applause can be heard from some members of the audience.\n\nThat he loves men and has sex with men isn‚Äôt an issue in his homeland, but it is in Qatar, a country which from Sunday will be hosting the month-long World Cup, one of sport‚Äôs biggest and most lucrative events.\n\nVisitors gather at the FIFA World Cup countdown clock in Doha on October 30, 2022. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, it is undoubtedly a historic event, but it is also one clouded by controversy, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured as the Gulf state prepared for the tournament, to LGBTQ and women‚Äôs rights.\n\nHomosexuality in Qatar is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. A report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to ‚Äúill-treatment in detention.‚Äù\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Minden said he would not be going to Qatar and would not be watching the competition on television.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we talk about the situation for the LGBTQ+ rights, we mean not only the football tourists, but also the situation before, and especially after, the World Cup,‚Äù he said.\n\nAfter the conference, Minden said he spoke privately with the ambassador who he said told him all were welcome to Qatar. But Minden told CNN: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe and it‚Äôs not right.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòEveryone is welcome to Qatar‚Äô\n\nA Qatar government official told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country. ‚ÄúEveryone is welcome in Qatar,‚Äù the statement read, adding: ‚ÄúOur track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.‚Äù\n\nMeasures were being implemented to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to ‚Äúan inclusive and discriminatory-free‚Äù World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n‚ÄúThere has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,‚Äù the statement read.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.‚Äù\n\nBut there have been mixed messages with a World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was ‚Äúdamage in the mind,‚Äù in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nWhen asked by CNN for its advice to any members of the LGBTQ community traveling to Qatar, FIFA referred to a recent public statement made by Fatma Samoura, the the governing body‚Äôs secretary general, who said: ‚ÄúNo matter your race, your religion, your social and sexual orientation, you are most welcome, and Qataris are ready to receive you with the best hospitality that you can imagine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt feel comfortable traveling to Qatar‚Äô\n\nBut for Englishman Rob Sanderson the respecting of cultures is a ‚Äútwo-way street.‚Äù\n\nSanderson is Special Projects Officer of Pride in Football, a network of UK LGBTQ fan groups and one of the supporter groups which joined forces in an open letter to condemn both FIFA and the Supreme Committee, refuting the world governing body and Qatar‚Äôs claims that it would be a World Cup for all.\n\nHe is a regular at England internationals and was once the victim of a homophobic assault, he says, at Wembley four years ago, ahead of England‚Äôs match against Spain in 2018, when he had an altercation with another fan. The incident was reported to the police and investigated, he says, but there was ‚Äúinsufficient evidence‚Äù to proceed, he says. But, largely, he has felt accepted at England matches, where he and his friends hold pride flags aloft celebrating their community and the team.\n\nHowever, he will not be going to Qatar and says if England were to win the tournament, it would be a tarnished trophy.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable traveling out to Qatar and being in any way visible because if I‚Äôm visibly showing I‚Äôm an LGBT+ football fan, all I‚Äôm doing is drawing a target on the back of a local who is anything other than hostile towards me,‚Äù the 34-year-old told CNN.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable being used as an excuse for any hostility that would be around after the tournament. It doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.‚Äù\n\nQatar isn‚Äôt the first controversial host of a big sporting event, or even a FIFA World Cup. The last edition was held in Russia, a country which introduced laws in 2013 which banned ‚Äúpropaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.‚Äù\n\nIn the build-up to the 2018 tournament, the UK Foreign Office warned of a ‚Äúheightened risks‚Äù to members of the LGBT community traveling to Russia.\n\nBut while some Pride in Football members went to Russia, Sanderson says, feeling that it was safe as Russian society had previously accepted, in the post-Soviet and pre-Putin era, same-sex relationships, none of its members are going to Qatar. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally different environment,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúThey said ‚Äòeveryone‚Äôs welcome‚Äô but they‚Äôve signed that line off by saying ‚Äòyou must respect our culture‚Äô.‚Äù\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off on Sunday.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Samoura was sent out to the 32 participating nations but would not divulge the contents.\n\nA joint statement issued earlier this month by fan groups Pride in Football, The Rainbow Wall and Three Lions Pride said: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear, talking about human rights is neither ideological nor political. It is simply asking for decency and the ability for people to be able to watch their teams without fear of abuse.‚Äù\n\nA number of European federations also issued a statement saying they would continue to campaign at the tournament on human rights issues and compensation for migrant workers.\n\nUSA's team logo is displayed in a room used for briefings during a training session at the team's training camp in Doha ahead of Qatar 2022. Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGareth Bale, once the world‚Äôs most expensive footballer and Wales captain, will wear a OneLove armband during matches in Qatar in support of a season-long campaign which promotes diversity and inclusion. Wales is one of eight participating European countries at the World Cup supporting the initiative.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to Qatar, the former Real Madrid player said: ‚ÄúWe can shed a light on the problems that are going on.‚Äù\n\nHowever, Hugo Lloris, captain of France, another team participating in the OneLove campaign, said on Monday he had to ‚Äúshow respect‚Äù to Qatar‚Äôs culture when asked by reporters about wearing a rainbow-colored armband.\n\n‚ÄúIn France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to play by our rules and respect our culture ‚Äì and I will do the same when I go to Qatar,‚Äù he said.\n\nEngland flew into Qatar on Tuesday on a plane called ‚ÄúRain Bow‚Äù and the US Men‚Äôs National Team (USMNT) is displaying a rainbow logo at the team‚Äôs training facility in Doha. Talking to reporters, head coach Gregg Berhalter said: ‚ÄúWe recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress, but there‚Äôs some work still to do.‚Äù\n\nThe nearer we get to the kick-off of the opening match between Qatar and Ecuador on November 20, the louder the dissenting voices are becoming and the more visible the signs of support for LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe World Cup, like the Olympics, puts the host country under a global spotlight. Usually, most controversies are forgotten once the sport starts, but such has been the intensity of focus on Qatar‚Äôs human rights record that it would be astonishing if all were forgotten by kickoff on Sunday.

Sign up here.\n\nDoha CNN ‚Äî\n\nQatar is unrecognizable from the country it was 12 years ago when it won its bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Around $220 billion has been pumped into building an entirely new city, a state-of-the-art metro system and hundreds of new hotel and apartment buildings.\n\nLike previous countries to host major events, Qatar has been under the watchful eye of the international community. At the same time, its own people have been exposed to international ideals as well as shifting cultural and societal norms as they anticipated the influx of over a million football fans to their tiny country.\n\n‚ÄúQatar changed a lot in the past 12 years and, culturally speaking, this has made a huge impact,‚Äù 30-year-old Qatari football fan Ali Adnan Abel told CNN. ‚ÄúWe have seen more diversity that has made Qataris realize it‚Äôs time to let the shields down.‚Äù\n\nIn hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been under intense pressure to enact legal changes. It dismantled the controversial Kafala system, a long-established regional labor practice that gives companies and the minority citizen population control over migrant workers‚Äô employment, movement, and immigration status.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen in this case is, certainly there was no attention whatsoever internationally or even on a national level to the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and that certainly did change after Qatar won the ability to host the World Cup,‚Äù James Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Doha, told CNN on Saturday.\n\nBut questions remain as to whether the reforms will stick once the tournament is over and the world‚Äôs gaze shifts away from the Gulf nation.\n\nThe Qatari organizers of the event insist those changes are here to stay.\n\n‚ÄúAll of this is actually part of the vision that we have for 2030 and it is one of the pillars of that vision,‚Äù Fatma Al Nuaimi, a spokesperson for the organizers, Qatar‚Äôs Supreme Committee, told CNN‚Äôs Becky Anderson, referring to the government‚Äôs blueprint for its future.\n\nQatar, a deeply conservative Muslim country, relaxed alcohol laws in the lead-up, allowing fans to drink in specific zones even though being drunk in public is illegal ‚Äì although just two days before kick-off, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at stadiums.\n\nThe tournament has also given the opportunity for men and women to mingle in an otherwise segregated country. Women and children have had a strong presence in fan zones and stadiums , watching the games in what has traditionally been a male-dominated sphere.\n\nHowever, history shows that it is uncommon for large sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics to be long-term catalysts for societal change. Russia infamously hosted the World Cup in 2018 and sought to project an image of tolerance by allowing fans to carry rainbow flags despite a yearslong crackdown on the LGBTQ community.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin has since shunned liberalism, as tensions with the West spiraled, and after invading Ukraine earlier this year, Moscow came down hardon any subsequent anti-war protests. And just last week, the lower house of the country‚Äôs parliament passed an amendment to its ‚ÄúLGBT propaganda‚Äù law, banning all Russians from promoting or ‚Äúpraising‚Äù homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are normal.\n\nOn the other hand, studies have shown that the international perception of Germany was enhanced after it hosted the 2006 World Cup, and much of the sporting infrastructure put in place is still in use.\n\n‚ÄúFor there to be a positive legacy, this change has to keep on going,‚Äù said Thomas Ross Griffin, an assistant professor of American and postcolonial literature at Qatar University. ‚ÄúAnd what the history of tournaments in London, Brazil, Russia told us, is that change often ends once the final whistle is blown. It‚Äôs on Qatar to demonstrate to the world that their change is something that would be kept going beyond the final game of the tournament.‚Äù\n\nWhile changes have been made to Qatar‚Äôs labor laws, human rights groups say more needs to be done. Just one month before the World Cup began, Amnesty International said the 2020 labor reforms had not been implemented or enforced properly. Qatar, it said, continues to lack freedom of expression and association and discriminates against women and LGBTQ people in law.\n\n‚ÄúNow, the question is if [this reform] wasn‚Äôt implemented properly before the World Cup with the eyes of the world on Qatar, what are the prospects after the World Cup that‚Äôs the big concern,‚Äù Lynch said.\n\nWhile some have called for a boycott of Qatar for its treatment of LGBTQ people, others have argued that going to Doha and showing solidarity with the LGBTQ community there can affect lasting change. Spain‚Äôs openly gay sports minister, Miquel Iceta, said Thursday that hosting the World Cup will mean long-lasting improvement in Qatar‚Äôs human rights record by bolstering freedom and tolerance in the country.\n\nJakob Jensen, the Danish football association chief commended the changes that have taken place in Qatar since 2010 in an interview with CNN‚Äôs Becky Anderson Thursday. ‚ÄúWe do not believe in boycotting. We do believe you make a difference participating, discussing, engaging and dialogue,‚Äù he said.\n\nOthers however see Qatar hosting the event as a slap in the face for human rights activists. At FIFA‚Äôs 72nd annual Congress in April, the Norwegian football association President Lise Klaveness delivered a stinging speech that labeled the decision to award Qatar the tournament as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and demanded that FIFA do more to defend its principles.\n\nIt will likely take months and even years before the true extent of the World Cup‚Äôs influence on the tiny Gulf state is known, says Lynch.\n\n‚ÄúI think there will be an expectation that there will be comparable scrutiny for future major projects, and I think that‚Äôs a good thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether it leads to whole-scale reform, I think that‚Äôs a bigger question and I think we‚Äôll have to wait to see.‚Äù\n\nIran protests\n\nFarideh Moradkhani, a niece of Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, called on foreign governments to cut all ties with the Iranian government in a video statement shared on YouTube by her brother, Mahmoud Moradkhani, two days after she was arrested.\n\nFarideh, who is a well-known rights activist opposed to the Iranian regime, was arrested on Wednesday when she went to the prosecutor‚Äôs office to serve a court order, according to a tweet from her brother that day.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify when Farideh recorded the video statement shared by her brother on YouTube on Friday, and have reached out to Mahmoud for clarification.\n\nHere‚Äôs the latest:\n\nUNICEF on Sunday called for an end ‚Äúto all forms of violence and abuse that have reportedly claimed the lives of over 50 children and injured many more‚Äù in Iran.\n\nIranian footballer Voria Ghafouri has been bailed out after being arrested on charges of ‚Äúincitement against the regime,‚Äù Fars reported on Saturday.\n\nState-aligned Fars News was hacked on Friday, according to a message displayed on its website. The group, which identifies itself as ‚ÄúBlack Reward,‚Äù posted a message in Farsi condemning the news organization and the government.\n\nUN Human Rights Council President Federico Villegas told CNN‚Äôs Becky Anderson on Friday that he is confident Iran will cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission into human rights abuses committed during the protests\n\nThe digest\n\nTurkish, Egyptian ministers to meet in process of building ties\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that a process of building relations with Egypt will start with ministers of the two countries meeting, Reuters reported.\n\nBackground: Ankara‚Äôs ties with Cairo have been strained since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, then the Egyptian army chief, led the 2013 ouster of Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was strongly supported by Erdogan.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey has been on a push to ease tensions with Egypt and several other countries in the region since last year. Erdogan shook hands with Sisi in Qatar last week in what was described by an Egyptian presidency statement as a new start in bilateral relations. In a televised discussion program on Saturday, Erdogan said that he and Sisi had spoken for around half an hour to 45 minutes on the sidelines of the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nArab Monetary Fund signs $1 billion pact to support Yemeni government reforms\n\nThe Arab Monetary Fund has signed a $1 billion agreement to support Yemen‚Äôs economic reform program to its Saudi-backed government, Saudi state media said on Sunday. The new package by the Abu Dhabi-based fund, which includes countries from the Middle East and North Africa, will provide support for the Yemeni government‚Äôs efforts to stabilize the economy from 2022 to 2025, Reuters reported, citing Saudi Ekhbaria TV.\n\nBackground: After the Houthi rebels stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014 and ousted the government, sending it into exile, Yemen‚Äôs central bank split into two branches ‚Äì one in Sanaa, under Houthi control, and one internationally recognized branch in Aden, which has access to money printers. Aden‚Äôs branch is under the control of the Saudi-backed administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The war between the Houthi group and a Saudi-led coalition has brought Yemen‚Äôs economy to its knees and caused the world‚Äôs largest humanitarian crisis. Inflation and foreign currency shortages have made food, water and fuel unaffordable for many in Yemen, which imports most of its needs. The Yemeni riyal has reached all-time lows in provinces controlled by the Saudi-backed government.\n\nThis year has been the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis since early 2000s\n\nThis year is already the deadliest in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in Israel and the West Bank since the early 2000s, a CNN analysis of official numbers from both Israel and the Palestinian Authority shows. The Israel number includes security forces and civilians killed in Palestinian attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Most were Israeli citizens, but the number includes foreigners living in Israel, according to the Israeli Security Agency, more commonly known as the Shin Bet. The Palestinian Ministry of Health told CNN that 150 Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Israel have been killed this year, mostly by Israeli security forces ‚Äì a number that includes militants and civilians.\n\nBackground: The death over the weekend of Tadasa Tashume Ben Ma‚Äôada from wounds in last Wednesday‚Äôs double bombing in Jerusalem brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side to 31 this year, according to Israeli Security Agency (ISA) data and a CNN count.\n\nWhy it matters: The Israeli military is increasingly targeting new militant groups in Jenin and Nablus and claims most of the Palestinians killed were militants or engaging violently with their forces. Human rights groups say dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed as well.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nIranian state media has called for the US to be kicked out of the World Cup after the United States Soccer Federation changed Iran‚Äôs flag on its social media platforms to show support for protesters in Iran.\n\nThe federation had temporarily displayed Iran‚Äôs national flag on its official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts without the emblem of the Islamic Republic. A now-deleted graphic of the Group B standings posted on Saturday displayed the Iranian flag only bearing its green, white and red colors.\n\nUS Soccer told CNN on Sunday that it wanted to change the official flag for 24 hours to show ‚Äúsupport for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights‚Äù but always planned to go back to the original flag.\n\nRead more:\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Eoin Mcsweeney Mohammed Abdelbary", "Eoin Mcsweeney", "Mohammed Abdelbary"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/politics/world-cup-qatar-what-matters/index.html", "title": "5 rules for watching a complicated World Cup | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN‚Äôs What Matters newsletter.

There are reasons to skip this year‚Äôs tournament.\n\nFor example, stadiums erected for the occasion in host nation Qatar were built on the backs of workers from Asia and Africa.\n\nThe conditions endured by those migrant workers have stirred controversy ‚Äì from the intense heat they had to endure while building Qatar‚Äôs World Cup infrastructure to how many of them may have died. World Cup organizers vehemently dispute expert estimates that thousands died.\n\nRELATED: ‚ÄòOur dreams never came true.‚Äô These men helped build Qatar‚Äôs World Cup, now they are struggling to survive\n\nHuman rights, gay rights and corruption\n\nThe former Obama administration official Tommy Vietor and the soccer pundit Roger Bennett count the ways this World Cup is problematic in a piece for CNN Opinion. Read their take.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the issue of LGBTQ rights. FIFA threatened sanctions against the captains of teams who planned to wear armbands to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination, one of a number of last-minute changes the international soccer governing body and Qatar made to the tournament. Homosexuality is against the law in Qatar, although the country‚Äôs Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy told CNN the tournament would be inclusive. Read more.\n\nIf you‚Äôre taking Qatar at their word for inclusivity, imagine having shelled out the coin for game tickets, travel and accommodation for a World Cup in the desert only to learn days before it started that stadiums would not sell beer after all. That‚Äôs clearly offside.\n\nThere‚Äôs a new documentary, ‚ÄúFIFA Uncovered‚Äù ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt paint world soccer‚Äôs governing body in an altogether flattering light given the organization‚Äôs recent history of wrongdoing ‚Äì streaming just in time for the World Cup. The allegations against FIFA are not new ‚Äì the US government made them years ago ‚Äì but they are worth considering again.\n\nWatch closely for signs of protest. Iranian players appeared to show solidarity with those protesting against the regime back home. The players stood silent as the Iranian national anthem played out around the Khalifa International Stadium before kickoff on Monday in their game against England.\n\nWith journalists‚Äô access in Qatar limited, some teams may take up the role of protest against the tournament, such as with Denmark‚Äôs jerseys, designed to respect the stadium workers.\n\nThe argument to watch anyway\n\nQatar has a close soccer relationship with France, notably investing in the Paris Saint-Germain football club.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told journalists during a recent international summit that questions about Qatar should have been raised years ago, during the bid process. He said the event itself provides a path to openness and has worth.\n\n‚ÄúThe vocation of these big events is to allow athletes of all countries, including sometimes of countries at war, to allow sport to exist and sometimes find, through sport, ways of discussing when people no longer manage to talk,‚Äù he said.\n\nQatar‚Äôs side of the story\n\nQatar‚Äôs ambassador to the US, Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad Al Thani, argues the tournament will help change misconceptions about his country, which he says worked with a United Nations organization to improve working conditions.\n\n‚ÄúQatar is not opposed to scrutiny,‚Äù he wrote in a CNN Opinion piece responding to the Bennett and Vietor commentary. ‚ÄúIn fact we have embraced it ‚Äì but too often platforms have been used to present one-sided, factually inaccurate arguments that go beyond what some other countries awarded major events have faced, despite each having their own unique set of challenges to overcome.‚Äù Read the whole piece.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino also defended the tournament in an hourlong explosive tirade in front of journalists Saturday. He hit back at Western criticisms of human rights issues.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we Europeans have been doing for the last 3,000 years, we should be apologizing for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe What Matters rules for watching the World Cup\n\nAssuming you do watch, here are the informal rules I‚Äôve developed, with help from fellow fans on text chains, for my own enjoyment of the World Cup.\n\nAnd by the way, these rules often contradict each other, so you have to weigh the importance of one over the other. That‚Äôs up to you. Or make up your own rules.\n\n1. Root for a former colony\n\nThat means root for the US over England when the two countries play in the group stage. Root for conquered Wales over England, even though Wales isn‚Äôt exactly a colony and England will be the heavy favorite.\n\nRoot for Brazil over Portugal, or Argentina over Spain. There‚Äôs something satisfying, at least to this American, about the idea of New World conquering Old World, or an African team defeating France or Belgium.\n\nAsterisks to the colony rule. When I mentioned this rule to one friend, he pointed out the US, while it sprang from former British colonies, has occupied territories in the Atlantic and Pacific, so it‚Äôs not always an easy rule to apply.\n\nAnother complication to the colony rule is the large number of immigrants on many teams. Much of the French team that won in 2018, for example, was born outside France, and most of the players had some roots in Africa ‚Äì including the young star Kylian Mbappe. Here‚Äôs an interesting report from the Migration Policy Institute about the rise of immigrant players on World Cup teams.\n\n2. Root for a free country over a not-free country\n\nThere‚Äôs a sliding scale of freedom in the world, according to Freedom House, the independent watchdog that gets funding from the US government.\n\nQatar, for instance, scores a paltry 25 on Freedom House‚Äôs 0-100 scale that combines access to political rights and civil liberties. But it‚Äôs not the lowest-scoring country taking part in the World Cup: Saudi Arabia scores a 7 and Iran scores a 14.\n\nNor is the US, at 83, the freest. Canada gets a 98, and Uruguay and Denmark both get a 97.\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of the World Cup countries batched alphabetically into their World Cup group stage assignments, alongside their Freedom House scores.\n\nGroup A:\n\nEcuador (71), Netherlands (97), Qatar (25), Senegal (68)\n\nGroup B:\n\nEngland (93 for the UK as a whole), Iran (14), United States (83), Wales (93 for the UK)\n\nGroup C:\n\nArgentina (84), Mexico (60), Poland (81), Saudi Arabia (7)\n\nGroup D:\n\nAustralia (95), Denmark (97), France (89), Tunisia (64)\n\nGroup E:\n\nCosta Rica (91), Germany (94), Japan (96), Spain (90)\n\nGroup F:\n\nBelgium (96), Canada (98), Croatia (85), Morocco (37)\n\nGroup G:\n\nBrazil (73), Cameroon (15), Serbia (62), Switzerland (96)\n\nGroup H:\n\nGhana (80), South Korea (83), Portugal (95), Uruguay (97)\n\n3. Pick the country with the lower per capita GDP\n\nIt‚Äôs fun to root for the underdog, and the difference in access to facilities and paychecks varies a lot by country. What a European or North American country can offer its squad is a lot different than what an African or Central American team can offer.\n\nThe US gross domestic product amounts to more than $69,000 per capita, according to World Bank data, and Qatar‚Äôs oil-rich figure is more than $61,000. Senegal‚Äôs per capita GDP, the tournament‚Äôs lowest, is less than $1,700. Ecuador, Iran, Tunisia, Ghana and Morocco all have per capita GDPs under $6,000.\n\nNote on combining rules No. 1 and No. 2. Teams that rate relatively high on the freedom score despite relatively low capita GDPs are Ecuador, Ghana and, to a lesser extent on the GDP front, Croatia, a World Cup finalist in 2018.\n\n4. Pick the team that has never won\n\nThirty-two countries participate in the World Cup. Only eight countries have ever won the World Cup trophy. It‚Äôs getting repetitive, and all but one are in the tournament this year.\n\nYou can tell by the number of stars players wear on their jerseys. Brazil has won five and Germany has triumphed four times. Italy has also won four but didn‚Äôt make the tournament this year. Argentina, France and Uruguay have won two, and Spain and England have each won one.\n\nThat still leaves a wide-open field of 25 teams looking for their country‚Äôs first World Cup title.\n\n5. Respect the agony of defeat\n\nIf you do watch, expect exciting upsets, sublime goal-scoring and human drama, all replayed and rehashed with the help of a video assistant referee, or VAR.\n\nLionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. This World Cup probably offers the final opportunity to see two masters who have both failed to win the tournament. Now in the extreme twilight of their careers, neither is an odds-on favorite this year to win the trophy for their country (Argentina and Portugal, respectively).\n\nRELATED: Messi and Ronaldo‚Äôs last dance\n\nCurses. Every World Cup provides England with yet another, probably doomed, opportunity to excise the curse of failure that has followed it since winning the 1966 tournament. Their agony makes for compelling television.\n\nBrazil can exert its otherworldly dominance upon European teams. Or not, depending on which Brazil shows up. Anything but victory will be a crushing loss for them.\n\nAnd finally, the United States can come to grips with why it is so mediocre at the international men‚Äôs level in a sport so many American children adore and in which its national women‚Äôs team has dominated for so long.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Brown. Woods caught a glimpse of the future Ole Miss and NFL star during an off-season scrimmage between Starkville and South Panola in 2015.\n\nThe legendary Mississippi high school football coach already had four of his 11 state championships at the time, and within a few minutes Brown‚Äôs talent proved to be undeniable.\n\nWoods and his wife Susan were watching two the greatest players Woods would coach during his 33-year coaching career.\n\n\"After the first series of downs, I turned to my wife and told her: 'No. 15 is a real player,' \" Woods said. \"He sticks out like a sore thumb.\"\n\nOLE MISS FOOTBALL RECRUITINGOle Miss, Mississippi State football battle over another instate WR: A Noreel White update\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE FOOTBALL RECRUITINGWhy Ole Miss, Mississippi State made 4-star Daniel Hill's top 10, and how Tennessee impressed\n\nWoods took over the Yellow Jackets football program in May 2015 after two seasons at Peabody High in Tennessee. He had no idea that Starkville had another future NFL standout on the roster in Willie Gay Jr., an outside linebacker who would anchor a defense that held opponents to 11 points a game that season.\n\nThe two former teammates will face off in Super Bowl 57 on Sunday. Brown leads the Philadelphia Eagles with 1,496 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns, and Gay has 88 tackles and 2.5 sacks for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n‚ÄúGrew up five minutes away from each other,‚Äù Brown tweeted Jan. 30. ‚ÄúWon a state championship in high school together. Playing for the Super Bowl. The city is beyond proud.‚Äù\n\nThe Starkville coaching staff knew the duo was destined for greatness.\n\nYellow Jackets wide receivers coach Willie Gillespie knew Brown had great ball skills when he started coaching him as a sophomore in 2013. Brown just had to figure the rest of the game out.\n\nGillespie saw it happen in real time against South Panola in the second round of the playoffs. Starkville lost 20-6, but Brown had two catches for 85 yards and a TD.\n\n\"We threw him a 6-yard hitch, and he made a guy miss and went about 60 yards for a touchdown,\" Gillespie said. \"Everybody looked at each other and went, 'Wow.' That was the first progression when we thought he's got to be special.\"\n\nBrown was an unstoppable force by his senior year in 2015. The four-star recruit was the No. 4 wideout in the country, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings. He was constantly double- and triple-covered but never complained about touches, according to Gillespie.\n\nSometimes three defenders weren‚Äôt enough. Callaway learned that when Brown finished with five catches for 118 yards and a TD in a 49-7 victory over the Chargers.\n\n\"We were playing Callaway and they had three or four guys on him,\" Gillespie said. \"We threw a fade over there. He hopped over them and caught the ball. I think a coach from Alabama was there and he saw the play, shook his head and walked off. It was incredible.\"\n\nDANDY DOZEN PREVIEW5 recruits who will help lay foundation for 2023 Clarion Ledger Football Dandy Dozen\n\nOLE MISS FOOTBALL RECRUITINGRecruiting Kamarion Franklin, first MS 5-star in 5 years: Ole Miss, Mississippi State update\n\nGay was the backbone for the Yellow Jackets' run to the 2015 state championship. He had 84 tackles, 17 for loss and six sacks that season, but his versatility is what stood out to Woods. The four-star prospect and No. 3 outside linebacker nationally went on to play a variety of positions for Starkville.\n\n\"Willie is the only player I've coached in my life that would be good at all 22 positions,\" Woods said. ‚ÄúHe would have been an excellent player no matter where you put him. I can't say that about any other player I've coached.\"\n\nGay displayed that as a senior in a 35-28 victory over Warren Central in 2016, when he was thrust into a larger offensive role after Starkville's starting quarterback was hurt that week in practice. The senior had 40 carries for 319 yards and five TDs.\n\nThere are 12 players who are either from Mississippi or played high school or college football in the state playing in the Super Bowl. It‚Äôs a point of pride for Brown.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a state that is hungry,‚Äù Brown said during an Eagles‚Äô media availability on Feb. 2. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of Philadelphia. It‚Äôs a poor state, not given much and you‚Äôve got to earn whatever you want. That‚Äôs just how it is.‚Äù\n\nWoods believes Gay learned a lot from Brown's senior year. Gay watched his recruitment process and saw how he handled the hype. Sunday will be a culmination of what the duo accomplished coming out of Starkville and what people can achieve coming out of Mississippi.\n\nIt means more than we'll ever know, according to Gillespie.\n\n\"A lot of times Mississippi is not put on the stage of greatness,\" Gillespie said. \"It validates for them that there are great things that happen in Mississippi. There are great players in Mississippi.\n\n\"The validation means more than anything. We didn't come from Texas or California. We came from rural Mississippi. We came for 16th section, moon farm and here we are in the Super Bowl.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/football/qatar-fifa-world-cup-ambassador-homosexuality-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Qatar FIFA World Cup ambassador says homosexuality is 'damage ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nQatar FIFA World Cup ambassador and former footballer Khalid Salman has said homosexuality is ‚Äúdamage in the mind,‚Äù in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF on Monday.\n\nThe interview, filmed in Doha less than two weeks before the start of the tournament, was immediately stopped by an official from the World Cup organizing committee.\n\nDuring the interview, Salman was discussing the issue of homosexuality being illegal in Qatar.\n\nSalman told ZDF that being gay was ‚Äúharam,‚Äù meaning forbidden according to Islamic law. ‚ÄúIt is damage in the mind,‚Äù Salman said.\n\nAs many people are expected to travel to Qatar for the World Cup, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk about gays,‚Äù Salman said.\n\n‚ÄúThe most important thing is, everybody will accept that they come here.

But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized ‚Äúfrom a Western point of view‚Äù what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation‚Äôs treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain‚Äôs public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year‚Äôs World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into ‚Äúnations and tribes‚Äù so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar‚Äôs Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn‚Äôt respond to CNN‚Äôs request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to ‚Äúan inclusive and discriminatory-free‚Äù World Cup.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.‚Äù\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn‚Äôt escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of ‚Äúa lot of mosques‚Äù in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said ‚ÄúQataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country‚Äù in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country‚Äôs population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n‚ÄúI think that the Western media is biased because they don‚Äôt want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],‚Äù Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar‚Äôs Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows ‚Äúthe depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.‚Äù\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar‚Äôs right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was ‚Äúlaced with hypocrisy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,‚Äù said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n‚ÄúScrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,‚Äù Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n‚ÄúEspecially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.‚Äù\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been ‚Äúfair and proportionate.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,‚Äù he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to ‚Äúface harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,‚Äù he said, adding that Qatar‚Äôs women and LGBTQ people ‚Äúface serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.‚Äù\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn‚Äôt receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n‚ÄúAt the risk of engaging in whataboutism‚Ä¶ Qatar‚Äôs human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,‚Äù said Al Hussein. ‚ÄúQatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.‚Äù\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an ‚Äúorientalist discourse,‚Äù referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n‚ÄúThis should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúRather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.‚Äù\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country‚Äôs human rights shortcomings.\n\n‚ÄúMany of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,‚Äù she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn‚Äôt help the cause of Qatar‚Äôs migrant workers.\n\n‚ÄúThe plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,‚Äù AlHajri told CNN. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be about whataboutism.‚Äù\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq‚Äôs border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who‚Äôd left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is ‚Äúa reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.‚Äù\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere‚Äôs the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker T√ºrk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the ‚Äúcritical‚Äù nature of the situation in the country.

The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city‚Äôs Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was ‚Äúdifferent from what we have seen in recent years.‚Äù The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran‚Äôs weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China‚Äôs rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market ‚Äúin light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.‚Äù The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/music/stagecoach/2023/04/29/stagecoach-2023-5-standout-moments-from-trixie-mattels-set/70152540007/", "title": "Stagecoach 2023: 5 standout moments from Trixie Mattel's set", "text": "Drag superstar Trixie Mattel made her Stagecoach country music festival debut on Friday as she rocked the Palomino Stage.\n\nMattel, who is known for her high camp comedy and acoustic musical styles and for winning \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Star,\" went through a number of perfectly pink outfits, showed her sharp comedy skills and serenaded audience members with her guitar (and another lesser-known instrument).

The law was set to take effect April 1, but a federal judge in Tennessee issued a temporary restraining order on the law.\n\nShe also took aim at Bud Light, which recently found itself under attack from Right-wing commentators after TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney posted a sponsored video during the brand's March Madness campaign. Mulvaney is a transgender woman, and many conservatives were not happy that Budweiser was associating with a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n‚ÄúI was dressed normally (earlier) and then I had one sip of Bud Light and this just happened magically,‚Äù she joked about her drag appearance.\n\n'The gay stage'\n\nEarlier in the day, Mattel saw singer Melissa Etheridge passing by in a golf cart and chased her down to get a picture. Mattel said she specifically started playing music because of the Grammy Award singer.\n\nIn addition to Etheridge, who performed at the Palomino earlier in the day, Mattel also shouted out Orville Peck. who had his Stagecoach performance at the same stage last year. Both performers, along with Mattel, identity as members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n‚ÄúThis has really become the gay stage,‚Äù she said, which was met with cheers. ‚ÄúEven the band before me, ZZ Top, that sounds like a Grindr profile.‚Äù\n\nFun visuals\n\nMattel's outfits and vocals weren't the only thing keeping the Palomino crowd entertained.\n\nAs the \"All Stars\" winner performed, the visuals behind her elevated her songs and frankly made plenty of people laugh. There were plenty of Barbie dolls showcased throughout her set (her last name pays homage to the company that manufactures the popular doll), and \"Hello Hello\" featured several phone motifs. When she stepped away for a costume change, a commercial for the unfortunately named discontinued appetite-suppressant candy AYDS played, which made many in the audience laugh.\n\nTribute to a country great\n\nThere's plenty of people who have inspired the singer to pursue her musical career, and one of those is country great Loretta Lynn. Lynn's career spanned six decades, and she released multiple gold albums. She died in October.\n\nMattel paid tribute to the late singer with her upbeat rock song, \"C‚Äômon Loretta,\" which got the crowd dancing. The song is off of Mattel's double album, \"The Blonde & Pink Albums.\"\n\nEma Sasic covers entertainment and health in the Coachella Valley.

The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n‚ÄúHe should be here,‚Äù Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor‚Äôs six-week abortion ban ‚Äúa terrible mistake‚Äù and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC‚Äôs Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre better off when everybody counts,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to ‚Äúlevel with the American people‚Äù on the issue.\n\n‚ÄúJust because‚Ä¶Putin‚Äôs an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,‚Äù he said, bringing up the country‚Äôs ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, ‚ÄúA win for Russia is a win for China.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúBut I forgot, you like China.‚Äù\n\nRamaswamy hit back that ‚Äúhurling personal insults‚Äù were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a ‚Äúgreenlight‚Äù to China to invade Taiwan. ‚ÄúPeace comes through strength,‚Äù Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n‚ÄúThis is where President Trump went wrong,‚Äù Haley said. ‚ÄúHe focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don‚Äôt know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American‚Äô\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.‚Äù\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n‚ÄúWe've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúYou empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida‚Äôs new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on ‚Äúhow slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.‚Äù The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida‚Äôs other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n‚ÄúFlorida is showing how it‚Äôs done,‚Äù DeSantis said, boasting his administration‚Äôs focus parents‚Äô rights and having ‚Äúeliminated critical race theory.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‚Äòhoney, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWhy is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?‚Äù Haley said. ‚ÄúWhen I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there‚Äôs two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n‚ÄúIt is our job to make sure that never happens,‚Äù Ramaswamy said. ‚ÄúBut it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox. Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter.\n\n'Donald Duck': Chris Christie calls out Donald Trump for absence\n\nWhile answering a question on crime rates in America, Chris Christie took time to address Donald Trump directly, calling him too afraid to join the debate stage.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to call you Donald Duck,‚Äù Christie, who turned directly to the camera to address the former president, said Wednesday night.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nTim Scott criticizes Vivek Ramaswamy after he says he's not ‚Äòbought and paid for‚Äô\n\nIn the first Republican debate, Vivek Ramaswamy said that he was the only GOP candidate ‚Äúnot bought and paid for.‚Äù Scott invoked those comments in the Wednesday's debate when he criticized Ramaswamy over business in China.\n\nRamaswamy pushed back by saying that while he opened a subsidiary in China, what he did differently from other companies is that he ‚Äúgot the hell out of there.‚Äù\n\nWhat's the CCP? It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of Tim Scott‚Äôs comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n‚ÄúI understand that hardship is not a choice,‚Äù Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes ‚Äúvictimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can‚Äôt fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn‚Äôt think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n‚ÄúWhat I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing ‚Äî showing up,‚Äù Scott told ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right ‚Äì and wrong\n\n‚Äì Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv‚Äôs counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia‚Äôs violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äô description of the conflict as a ‚Äúterritorial dispute‚Äù helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a ‚Äúwar criminal.‚Äù Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden‚Äôs border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He‚Äôll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‚Äòvice presidential debate at best‚Äô\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump‚Äôs running mate in 2024. At least that‚Äôs how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a vice presidential debate at best,‚Äù he told CBS News. ‚ÄúThis is the JV team.‚Äù\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday‚Äôs discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù with the primary in every poll.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the XFL, and it‚Äôs entertainment, I guess,‚Äù he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n‚Äì Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president ‚àí and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn‚Äôt given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n‚ÄúI think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,‚Äù he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump‚Äôs indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion‚Äôs harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley‚Äôs comments during the event, saying abortion is ‚Äúa moral issue.‚Äù\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate ‚àí she certainly garnered the best reviews ‚àí and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn‚Äôt alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn‚Äôt allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him ‚Äì while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calder√≥n.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. ‚ÄúIt's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,‚Äù then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation‚Äôs highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. ‚Äì John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president ‚Äúcannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.‚Äù South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court‚Äôs decision.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,‚Äù Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n‚Äì Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country‚Äôs future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy‚Äôs lack of political experience, Haley‚Äôs perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump‚Äôs speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won‚Äôt go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state. It's also the epicenter of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, where workers are protesting the nation's largest auto companies.\n\nTrump also skipped the first Republican debate last month, explaining that he didn‚Äôt want to give opponents free shots at him.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nFox's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino, UNIVISION's Ilia Calder√≥n are moderating\n\nFox News Media's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino and UNIVISION's Ilia Calder√≥n will co-moderate the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nCalder√≥n will be the first Afro-Latina to moderate a Republican Primary Debate, according to the network.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo\n\nGOP debate participants\n\nSeven Republican candidates are expected to participate in the Wednesday debate: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who qualified for the first GOP debate last month, did not make the stage this time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson did not qualify for the first or second debate.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow to watch the Republican debate tonight?

It will air at will air at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe RNC will also stream the event on video-sharing platform Rumble.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo\n\nWhen does the Republican debate start?\n\nThe second GOP presidential primary debate will take place Wednesday, Sept. 27, will air at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe Republican candidates are set take the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, California on Wednesday as they continue vying for their party‚Äôs nomination in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nFox Business Network and Univision will broadcast the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/08/15/against-the-odds-asa-hutchinson-remains-optimistic-hell-join-first-republican-debate/70536020007/", "title": "Asa Hutchinson still optimistic he'll join first GOP presidential debate", "text": "As the first Republican presidential debate looms, candidate Asa Hutchinson is still short on meeting his campaign donation requirement to participate.\n\nDespite that, Hutchinson outwardly appears as hopeful as ever that he will earn a spot on the stage.\n\nThe former Arkansas governor, who‚Äôs been fighting for name recognition and donations amid a sea of Republican candidates, says he‚Äôs gained steam over the past month.\n\nHutchinson‚Äôs campaign reported reaching 6,444 unique donors on July 14. In early August, Hutchinson told the Des Moines Register the campaign had garnered more than 10,000 new donations over two weeks. And last week, Hutchinson's campaign confirmed he had reached 22,000 donors, according to Politico.\n\nHutchinson said he‚Äôs also reached the polling requirement set for the debate by the Republican National Committee, despite not spending a ‚Äúdime‚Äù on television advertising.\n\nWhile exploring the Iowa State Fair on Tuesday after Gov. Kim Reynolds' \"fair-side chat,\" Hutchinson wouldn't reveal an estimate on the latest donor count, adding he was waiting for new numbers to come in. Federal Election Commission filings show Hutchinson received about $500,000 in campaign contributions from April 1 to June 30.\n\nHutchinson credits his grassroots campaigning and clear message for steadily winning over prospective voters. His frequent criticisms against President Donald Trump have also turned heads.\n\nBut he‚Äôs still a far cry from the RNC‚Äôs donor threshold, which requires getting 40,000 unique donations, to join fellow candidates like former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on stage on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee.\n\n‚ÄúWe are growing significantly every day,‚Äù Hutchinson told the Register. ‚ÄúSo the response has obviously been positive to my message ‚Äî people want me on the debate stage. It‚Äôs a big lift to get to 40,000 coming from a small state ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm optimistic we will\" get there, he said.\n\nAsa Hutchinson condemns Trump's latest indictments\n\nHutchinson has repeatedly condemned Trump for indictments, including the charges that came Monday night from a grand jury in Georgia accusing the former president and a slate of allies of trying to steal Biden‚Äôs win in the state during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHutchinson on Tuesday called the latest slate of charges ‚Äúa sad moment for our country,\" adding that Trump's actions \"disqualified\" him from taking office again. And unlike most of his opponents, Hutchinson would not pardon Trump if elected, he told Scripps News.\n\nHutchinson‚Äôs frequent and sharp criticisms of Trump have set him apart from his opponents, who have been reluctant to criticize Trump and call out his charges, but it has caused him to draw some ire from some Republicans. In July, Hutchinson was met with boos and chants of \"Trump\" when he spoke at the Turning Point Action Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to CNN.\n\nShowing up to Trump-heavy events like the Turning Point conference is all part of a plan to get voters into his camp, he said.\n\n‚ÄúI went there because it‚Äôs an audience I want to reach out to because I‚Äôll need their vote at some time, whether it's after the primary or if Trump slides, I need those votes,\" he told the Register.\n\nRoger Sutton, of Steamboat Rock, Iowa, said after Hutchinson's speech in early August, he had no strong opinion of him but said he was impressed by his track record as governor. He said Trump and DeSantis are the only candidates that have a chance.\n\n\"The enemy is Joe Biden and the deep state, he said.\n\nAsa Hutchinson at the Iowa State Fair\n\nHutchinson, who espouses Ronald Regan-era values and policies, has made dozens of visits to Iowa stopping at around 40 events since April. His retail-style campaign has focused on covering the entire state, often speaking at events in cities like Wahpeton, Garber and Newton at events hosted by local county GOP committees to groups as small as eight prospective voters.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Hutchinson joined Texas pastor and presidential candidate Ryan Binkley at the Hardin County Republicans Sweet Corn Feed hosted by Steve and Jodie Gehrke in Eldora, Iowa, where he delivered a short elevator pitch citing recapping his experience as governor and cited issues like the economy and border security.\n\nHutchinson, who told the crowd he was celebrating his 50th wedding anniversary with his wife, Susan, said in a phone call with her earlier that day, she told him: \"Don't you come home until you get 40,000 donors.\"\n\nHutchinson returned for the start of the Iowa State Fair, boasting he was the only presidential candidate at the opening ceremony on Aug. 10 and that he would be attending the fair nearly every day. During the fair-side chat, he introduced an immigration plan that would have a state-based visa program to bring in skilled workers for industries such as agriculture and healthcare.\n\nIn a chat with reporters, he briefly jabbed Ron DeSantis about the state of Florida paying to fly about 50 Venezuelan migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard last fall, calling the tactic \"showboating.\" He applauded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ‚Äî who moved migrants arriving in Texas to downtown Los Angeles ‚Äî saying Abbott approached the issue in a \"much more serious way.\"\n\nVirginia Barreda is the Des Moines city government reporter for the Register.

Now, after using Wisconsin Republicans to orchestrate a campaign to stay in office following the 2020 election and a three-year campaign to discredit the state's election system, Trump has lost even more support among GOP voters ‚àí especially in the Milwaukee suburbs.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not campaign in Wisconsin after the Democratic primary in 2016, a snub Democrats said contributed to her loss to Trump in the general election.\n\nHow to watch:TV channel for the Republican presidential primary debate\n\nWhy wouldn't Trump show up?\n\nBecause he's the frontrunner. Debates are typically opportunities for candidates behind in the polls to have a breakout moment, and can be risks for candidates leading in the polls.\n\nTrump told conservative website Breitbart News it would be \"sort of foolish\" or \"stupid\" to attend given his significant polling lead over other candidates.\n\nAccording to recent national polls, Trump is leading Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis by double digits ‚àí in some cases more than 40 percentage points.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, that's not the case.\n\nTrump was favored by 31% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents surveyed, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was at 30%, according to a June survey by the Marquette University Law School.\n\nBut in a head-to-head matchup, DeSantis was favored by 57% and Trump by 41%.\n\nAnd in theoretical general election matchups next year, President Joe Biden led DeSantis by 49% to 47%, while Biden had a bigger lead against Trump, 52% to 43%.\n\nWhat to know:Your questions answered about the upcoming Republican presidential primary debate\n\nWhen will we know whether Trump will participate?\n\nWho knows. The Republican National Committee told Trump he has to decide at least 48 hours before the Aug. 23 event \"for security and logistics reasons,\" according to Politico.\n\n\"Trump has suggested to at least two people that he might attend and sit in the audience to 'troll' the candidates, though those people didn‚Äôt believe he was serious,\" Politico reported.\n\nWhat should we expect if Trump doesn't debate?\n\nDuring the Democratic National Convention in 2020, also in Milwaukee, Trump held a rally in Oshkosh to provide some counter programming.\n\nHe's could do the same this year if he doesn't end up attending the debate.\n\nMolly Beck can be reached at molly.beck@jrn.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/15/2024-republican-debate-milwaukee-qualify/70587112007/", "title": "Who's in the first Republican primary debate? Trump, DeSantis, and ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ‚Äî The first GOP primary debate will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in less than two weeks.\n\nBut not every 2024 Republican contender has qualified to hit the stage on Aug. 23 yet.\n\nThe Republican National Committee set requirements in June that candidates must meet on polling, fundraising and other factors to take part in the debate. For example, candidates must have a minimum of 40,000 unique donors, with at least 200 unique donors per state in 20+ states and territories.\n\nThey must also sign a pledge agreeing to support the eventual party nominee.\n\nWhile some candidates have easily met the requirements through name recognition and other strategies, including controversial tactics, other lower-polling candidates are still struggling to make headway.\n\nHere's a look at the Republican presidential hopefuls expected to make an appearance on the debate stage later this month, and others who might not have that chance.\n\nWhich candidates have qualified to be on stage?\n\nSo far, eight GOP candidates have qualified to hit the debate stage. These individuals include:\n\nTrump was one of the first candidates to qualify with a big donor base and national polling numbers far above the other candidates. His attempts to politicize his indictments as an attack from his political foes ‚àí an allegation he has made without evidence ‚àí has also appealed to his supporters.\n\nBut other candidates quickly met the criteria in creative ways. Burgum, for instance, offered a $20 gift card to anyone who donated $1 to his campaign.\n\nLikewise, after Trump was indicted on four counts for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election, Pence‚Äôs team began selling T-shirts and hats with the phrase ‚ÄúToo Honest.‚Äù That's a reference to how Trump described Pence during an episode from the indictment.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Trump will participate in the debate. He said in an interview with Newsmax that he will announce his decision this week. He has also vowed not to support the loyalty pledge because there are some candidates he wouldn't endorse for president.\n\nThe pledge states that candidates must \"honor the will of the primary voters and support the nominee in order to save our country and beat Joe Biden.\" It also says they will not seek to run as an independent, write in a candidate or seek and accept the nomination of another party.\n\nOther candidates have agreed to sign on, but Christie said in an ABC News interview earlier this year that he would take the pledge ‚Äúas seriously as Donald Trump did eight years ago,‚Äù when Trump signed a similar pledge but refused to agree to back the eventual nominee.\n\nWho hasn't qualified for the debate?\n\nSix GOP candidates have not yet qualified for the debate. These individuals include:\n\nSuarez andJohnson both announced that they have met the 40,000 donor threshold, but have not made progress with the polling requirements. The latest Republican primary poll average from RealClearPolitics lists Suarez at 0.1% while Johnson is not included.\n\nBinkley, Hutchinson and Elder have not met the donor requirements for the debate. Morgan Bonwell, Binkely‚Äôs 2024 Campaign Iowa State Director, told USA TODAY that Binkely has surpassed 27,000 donors.\n\nHutchinson said on CBS News last week that he is \"close to halfway there\" to getting 40,000 donors. Elder also told attendees at the Iowa State Fair that he was \"a little more than halfway\" in gaining the 40,000 donors needed to be on stage.\n\nHutchinson appears to have cleared the hurdles for polling requirements, but Elder and Binkely have yet to do so, according to an analysis from Politico.\n\nWhile Hurd has yet to meet the donor and polling requirements, he has maintained that he won't support the loyalty pledge. His spokesperson previously told USA TODAY that \"This is not about whether or not he‚Äôll support the Republican nominee, it‚Äôs about refusing to support Donald Trump.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/14/what-to-know-about-republican-presidential-debate-hosted-in-milwaukee-how-long-format-questions/70566198007/", "title": "What time does GOP presidential debate on Fox News, livestream ...", "text": "MADISON - Milwaukee will host the first Republican presidential primary debate Wednesday night.\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is skipping the event, eight other candidates have qualified and take the stage.\n\nHere's what we know about the debate format and who will appear onstage.\n\nMore:How to watch the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee\n\nMore:What you need to know about the Aug. 23 Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate will last around two hours. It will begin at 8 p.m. Milwaukee time and wrap up around 10.\n\nWill candidates give opening statements?\n\nCandidates won't give opening statements, though they will have 45 seconds for closing remarks, according to the format details obtained by Semafor.\n\nHow long will candidates talk?\n\nCandidates will have one minute to answer a question and 30 seconds for follow-up questions.\n\nWhat kind of debate is it?\n\nAll signs point to the first debate in Milwaukee following a traditional format, where candidates answer questions from moderators.\n\nOther types of debates include the town hall, during which candidates take questions from audience members. Candidates may also speak at forums that are hosted by private organizations, not political parties.\n\nWho will ask the questions?\n\nFox News anchors Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier are co-moderating the debate.\n\nSemafor reported that some of the questions will involve \"sound or video, including pre-taped questions submitted by students\" through the Young America's Foundation, which is a partner of the debate.\n\nThe group, which organizes young conservatives, is headed by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans are trying to make inroads with college-age voters, who have overwhelmingly turned out for liberals in recent statewide elections.\n\nHow many questions will be asked?\n\nIt's not clear at this point whether each candidate will have a chance to answer every question, or if candidates will be asked separate, specific questions about the issues.\n\nAt the early Republican primary debates in 2016, questions were posed to individual candidates about issues like abortion and foreign policy. For the first few debates, so many candidates ran that the group was split and debates were aired separately. Twelve debates and nine forums were held during the Republican primary that cycle.\n\nWhat is the 'spin room'?\n\nCandidates or their campaign representatives also make themselves available after the debate to meet with reporters and attempt to \"spin\" their performances.\n\nReporters and networks may conduct and air interviews from the spin room after the main debate event wraps up.\n\nWho will be onstage?\n\nWhile Trump plans to skip the debate and instead participate in an online interview with Tucker Carlson, eight other candidates have qualified and will appear onstage.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nTim Scott\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nChris Christie\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nMike Pence\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nCandidates will be placed onstage according to polling, with the highest polling candidate in the center.\n\nA few other candidates failed to meet the requirements, including Texas Rep. Will Hurd, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and radio host Larry Elder. Candidates had until 48 hours before the debate to meet the criteria.\n\nDo candidates need to sign a pledge?\n\nYes. Those who attend the Milwaukee debate must sign a series of pledges, including a promise to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nSome candidates, including Christie and Hutchinson, have criticized the pledge or suggested they won't follow it. Trump said Wednesday he wouldn't sign the pledge in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nIs this the only Republican debate?\n\nNo. The Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee is only the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. Fox Business will host a second debate Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\nThe qualifications to participate in that debate are tightened from the Milwaukee debate. A candidate will need 50,000 individual contributors, up from 40,000. A candidate also needs to poll at least 3% in two national polls or one national poll and two early-voting state polls, up from 1%.\n\nIn addition to letting voters hear from candidates about issues and allowing them to compare choices, debates also give candidates trailing in the polls opportunities to break out.\n\nMore debates will likely be announced ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which takes place July 15-18, 2024. Fiserv Forum will be the centerpiece of the convention, and the site of the debate.\n\nWill the candidates attend a town hall?\n\nMoms for Liberty, designated as an extremist antigovernment organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center, had planned a town hall with unnamed presidential candidates earlier on Aug. 23. That event has since been canceled.\n\nThe group will instead host a discussion with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson that afternoon at the Pfister Hotel, which will focus on Wisconsin students' proficiency in reading and math.\n\nTyler Katzenberger of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/25/republican-debate-2023-wednesday/70964166007/", "title": "How to watch second 2023 Republican primary debate: Start time ...", "text": "Republican candidates are set take the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif. on Wednesday as they continue vying for their party‚Äôs nomination in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nSo far only six candidates appear to have qualified for the second the second GOP primary debate despite eight appearing speaking at last month's two hour showdown in Milwaukee.

The RNC will also stream the event on video-sharing platform Rumble.\n\nWho is participating in the next GOP presidential primary debate?\n\nSo far, six candidates appear to have qualified for the second debate before the Wednesday deadline.

He is reportedly talking about an online interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but nothing official has been announced.\n\nGOP DEBATE: Play it safe? Blast Trump? Defend him? How DeSantis, Christie, other GOP candidates will seek to score debate points\n\nDeSantis said in an interview in July with Fox News host Will Cain that he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\nMike Pence qualified for the debate after a surge of donations after the latest indictment of his former boss, Donald Trump. He will be on the debate stage Aug. 23, his campaign confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nPence, one of the most recognizable names in the race, took a while to get here. By contrast, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie entered the race a day earlier than Pence and qualified for the debate a month sooner than Pence.\n\nBut as Pence has become more critical of Trump, he has attracted more donors ‚àí and more ire from the former president.\n\nMIKE PENCE: Pence the candidate vs. Pence the witness: Can he do both in 2024 election, Trump trials?\n\nHow to watch the first Republican presidential primary debate\n\nFox News announced in June the debate will air exclusively on its channel. It will air from 9-11 p.m. ET.\n\nWho is moderating the first Republican presidential primary debate?\n\nThe debate will be co-moderated by Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.\n\nWhy is the debate happening in Milwaukee?\n\nWisconsin is widely viewed as one of the most politically competitive states in the country, according to Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said that since the presidential election is decided by the electoral count rather than the popular vote, a shift of even a small number of votes in Wisconsin could help determine who is elected.\n\n\"Several analysts are already predicting that Wisconsin will the 'tipping point' state that decides when one of the tickets crosses the crucial threshold of 270 electoral votes,\" Burden said. \"For these reasons the major parties and candidates are laser-focused on the Badger State.\"\n\nWHY WISCONSIN MATTERS:The first GOP debate is being held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Here's why that matters\n\nUnlike some states such as Georgia and Minnesota, which sometimes have close presidential outcomes, Wisconsin is unique for consistently having tight elections, according to Burden. He said that the margin between two frontrunners was often less than 1% in four of the six elections held between 2000 and 2020, and that only two victories from former President Barack Obama stand out as ‚Äúsizable wins for one candidate.‚Äù\n\nWisconsin, a key battleground state, was the site of previous debates for both the Democratic and Republican parties in the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, has also held many rallies there.\n\n‚ÄúI am so excited to bring the world into Milwaukee, not just for the Republican Party, but to help businesses and business owners to highlight a bipartisan effort to do great things for this urban community,‚Äù Ronna McDaniel, the committee‚Äôs chair, told Wisconsin Public Radio.\n\nContributing: Sudiksha Kochi, David Jackson, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/republican-gop-debate-live-updates/70653558007/", "title": "Republican debate recap: Highlights as GOP candidates face off", "text": "Eight Republican presidential candidates battled Wednesday over Ukraine, abortion and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as they gathered in Milwaukee for their first primary debate of the 2024 cycle.\n\nWith frontrunner Donald Trump absent, Vivek Ramaswamy took a lot of heat, with Mike Pence calling him a \"rookie\" and Chris Christie attacking him as an \"amateur.\"\n\nAs other candidates criticized Ramaswamy‚Äôs lack of experience, the Republican entrepreneur said his business background was a better asset to lead a \"revolution‚Äù and pitched himself as some who could offer a new generation of leadership.\n\nNikki Haley ripped into Ramaswamy for saying that the United States should cede eastern Ukraine to Putin. ‚ÄúYou have no foreign policy experience and it shows,‚Äù she said.\n\nTrump‚Äôs name finally came up about an hour into the debate: The candidates were asked : Would you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\nWould you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection. Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. \"We can‚Äôt win a general election that way.\"\n\nTwo GOP candidates, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, again said that Trump's indictments disqualify him from leadership of the party or nation.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd at a sports arena in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nOn the stage in Milwaukee, most of the attacks went against businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, an upstart who has seen his poll numbers rise. Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn‚Äôt need a president who‚Äôs too old, or a president who‚Äôs too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who‚Äôs been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n‚àíSudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n‚ÄúWe need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,‚Äù Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,‚Äù she said, later adding, ‚ÄúParents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.‚Äù\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: ‚ÄúThe job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he‚Äôd freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy ‚Äúif we do the giveaway that you want to‚Äù and give Putin eastern Ukraine, ‚Äúit's not going to be too long‚Äù before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n‚ÄúUkraine is not a priority for the United States of America,‚Äù Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n‚ÄúYou have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,‚Äù Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did ‚Äì though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would‚Äôve done what he did.\n\n‚ÄúAnswer the question,‚Äù Pence said.\n\n‚ÄúMike did his duty,‚Äù DeSantis responded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got no beef with him.‚Äù\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, ‚Äúnot grudging credit.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump‚Äôs two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can‚Äôt win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence‚Äôs exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don‚Äôt support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù candidate, but there isn‚Äôt a uniform standard.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn‚Äôt having it.\n\n‚ÄúNikki, you‚Äôre my friend,‚Äù Pence said, ‚Äúbut consensus is the opposite of leadership.‚Äù\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a moral issue,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in ‚àí and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n‚àí Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‚ÄòA guy who sounds like ChatGPT‚Äô\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn‚Äôt hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here‚Ä¶‚Äù Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n‚ÄúThe last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what‚Äôs a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre dealing with the same type of amateur,‚Äù Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n‚ÄúThis is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,‚Äô‚Äù Haley said.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,‚Äù Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he‚Äôll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n‚àí Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn‚Äôt having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n‚ÄúThe truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,‚Äù she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n‚ÄúYou tell me who are the big spenders,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for an accountant in the White House.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won‚Äôt spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n‚ÄúFight it out,‚Äù Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to see how everybody conducts themselves‚Äô\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire‚Äôs crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to hearing somebody change my mind,‚Äù said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see how everybody conducts themselves,‚Äù Biel said, adding he‚Äôs open to ‚Äúpeople who I disagree with.‚Äù\n\n‚àí Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n‚ÄúThe public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‚Äòsoftball‚Äô interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday‚Äôs debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a ‚Äúsoftball‚Äù interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n‚ÄúIn his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he‚Äôs running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,‚Äù Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his ‚Äúbroken promises‚Äù to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely ‚Äúdouble down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.‚Äù\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n‚Äì Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president ‚Äúcannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.‚Äù South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court‚Äôs decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n‚àí Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n‚àí Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis‚Äô political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president‚Äôs record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Trump has already won this evening‚Äôs debate because everything is going to be about him,‚Äù Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n‚ÄúIn fact, tonight‚Äôs Republican undercard event really shouldn‚Äôt even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump‚Äôs team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump‚Äôs former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire ‚ÄúEnding Inflation‚Äù plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts ‚Äì entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week ‚Äúthree hours of solid debate prep‚Äù ‚Äì to the basketball courts ‚Äì North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O‚ÄôDonnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy‚Äù in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he ‚Äúwill share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate ‚àí advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that‚Äôs where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the ‚Äúmost dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war‚Äù and said it‚Äôs clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, ‚Äúbut if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.‚Äù\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan ‚Äì but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for ‚Äúsome nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson‚Äôs campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren‚Äôt accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n‚ÄúI am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,‚Äù Suarez wrote.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates‚Äô position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n‚ÄúEvery Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,‚Äù Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv‚Äôs counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia‚Äôs violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äô description of the conflict as a ‚Äúterritorial dispute‚Äù helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a ‚Äúwar criminal.‚Äù Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump‚Äôs indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn‚Äôt the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n‚ÄúIt's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,‚Äù then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation‚Äôs highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n‚Äì John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‚Äòas much as I can‚Äô of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to try to see ‚Äî get as much as I can, yes,‚Äù Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. ‚ÄúI have none,‚Äù he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù Republican Party.\n\n‚Äì Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n‚ÄúThe public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!‚Äù\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop the Trump Train,‚Äù senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon ‚Äúwalk through‚Äù said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024. Out of the last six presidential elections, four have been decided by less than one percentage point in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debate will be held ahead of the Republican National Convention, which is also set to take place in the city next year.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker\n\nHow can you watch the Republican debate?\n\nThe first Republican primary debate is scheduled for Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe debate, hosted by Fox News, will air on Fox News Channel as well as Fox Business Network.

Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott all qualified for the third debate, a smaller crowd from the previous two events.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump skipped the debate, citing his major lead in state and national polls. The former president has also said he wouldn‚Äôt sign the Republican ‚ÄúBeat Biden‚Äù pledge to support a GOP nominee, even if it isn't him.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live coverage of the third Republican primary debate here.\n\nClosing arguments: GOP candidates vow to wage 'war' on the nation's problems\n\nThe Republican candidates made their final arguments by employing a variety of martial metaphors.\n\nDeSantis: Pledged to reverse the nation's \"decline\" and said he is the one Republican candidate who can win a general election against President Joe Biden.\n\nHaley: \"The world is on fire\" in the Middle East and Ukraine, and she is part of a new generation who can move the country forward.\n\nRamaswamy: Pledged to win the \"war\" with the \"deep state\" and other anti-American forces. He also called on Biden to exit the race, though the president is unlikely to take the advice.\n\nChristie: Said he wants to address the \"divisions\" in American society. He did not mention Trump, whom he has blamed for fostering those divisions.\n\nScott: Said he would address the nation's \"cultural and spiritual\" crisis, and fight \"the war for Christian conservative values.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates pledge to fight opioid crisis, increase surveillance of southern border\n\nGOP candidates said they would beef up the technology at the southern border to fight fentanyl trafficking.\n\nTim Scott said he would impose stricter surveillance at the border to keep the synthetic drug out and prevent overdose deaths, and Chris Christie, a former U.S. attorney, said he would sign an executive order on his first day in office to send the National Guard to partner with ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù Customs and Border Protection officers at ports of entry.\n\nRon DeSantis said he would declare the opioid crisis a national emergency his first day in office and would send the U.S. military to the border.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm even going to build the border wall and have Mexico pay for it like Donald Trump promised,‚Äù he said.\n\nHe also issued a warning to members of the cartels who try to sneak drugs across the border: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to shoot them stone cold dead.‚Äù\n\nBiotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy said the crisis is closer to ‚Äúbioterrorism‚Äù and warrants a ‚Äúmore aggressive‚Äù means of response. He pledged to use the U.S. military to seal the southern border.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said that she would send special operations in to ‚Äútake out the cartels‚Äù but said the U.S. must also go to the source of the drug‚Äôs creation. She pledged to end normal trade relations with China until the drug flow stops.‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nRamaswamy: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm upset‚Äô after Ohio passes abortion rights ballot measure\n\nRamaswamy said he was upset by the outcome of the Ohio ballot measure on Tuesday where voters passed a constitutional amendment that enshrines abortion rights in the state constitution.\n\n‚ÄúWhy it‚Äôs back to that Republican culture of losing? The Republicans did not have an alternative amendment or vision on the table,‚Äù he said.\n\nRamaswamy said the missing piece of the abortion movement is \"sexual responsibility for men.\"\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not men‚Äôs rights versus women‚Äôs rights, it‚Äôs about human rights,‚Äù he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nNikki Haley on abortion: 'We don‚Äôt need to divide America over this issue anymore'\n\nHaley said she considers herself pro-life, but that she believes abortion is ‚Äúa personal issue for every woman and every man.‚Äù\n\nThe Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade corrected a wrong and returned the decision to the states, she said during Wednesday's debate.\n\nShe urged her competitors to ‚Äúbe honest‚Äù that passing a federal ban on abortions would require 60 votes in the Senate, which could not happen given the political makeup of the upper chamber.\n\nInstead, policymakers should focus on things they can agree on, she said, such as banning late-term abortions, making birth control accessible, and ensuring women don‚Äôt go to jail for getting an abortion.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to divide America over this issue anymore,‚Äù she said.\n\nLater asked whether she would sign a 15-week ban on abortions, she said: ‚ÄúI would support anything that would pass.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Riley Beggin\n\nTrump - and his followers - mock Republican debaters\n\nAs Republican rivals debated in Miami, Trump mocked them in a speech to followers in nearby Hialeah.\n\nStanding in front of thousands of people is \"a hell of a lot harder to do than a debate,\" Trump told the crowd at one point.\n\nMeanwhile, at the debate hall in Miami, some fans began a pro-Trump chant before an organizer told them to stop.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nDeSantis goes after Congress over Social Security\n\nCommenting on Social Security‚Äôs looming insolvency, DeSantis went after Congress and accused lawmakers of taking ‚Äúmoney from Social Security.‚Äù\n\nIt is unclear what DeSantis was specifically alluding to, but it was possible the Florida Governor took aim at Congress borrowing funds from the Social Security Trust Fund. Congress, DeSantis said, has ‚Äúa lot of dirty hands‚Äù on the social safety net.\n\nAs president, DeSantis said he would ‚Äúwill force Congress to stop spending so much money,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äì Ken Tran\n\nHaley hits DeSantis over Social Security\n\nThe federal debt and Social Security drew out another dispute between Haley and DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis said he can \"shore up\" Social Security by curbing inflation and growing the economy. He did not propose any changes to the popular program itself.\n\nHaley said the growing federal debt requires changes to Social Security and other entitlement programs, though they should be applied only to younger people who are years away from retirement.\n\nShe also chided DeSantis and other candidates for ignoring the problem.\n\n\"Any candidate that tells you they're not going to take on entitlements is not being serious,\" Haley said.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates answer first economy question\n\nThe first question on the state of the economy came over an hour into the debate. Tim Scott said as president, he would lead the country to use its own resources first before turning to other countries, like China.\n\nHe pointed to the important role of energy in the economy, with Christie agreeing.\n\n‚ÄúEnergy is the key to bringing this down... we need to do that first and foremost. That‚Äôs the short-term answer,‚Äù Christie said.\n\nDeSantis said on day one as president, he would rip up any regulations or executive orders related to Bidenomics, a slogan the president uses for his economic agenda.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard from multiple people the same story,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúWhen they go grocery shopping, what they now do is figure out what they have to take out of the cart once it‚Äôs ringing up because it rings up so much faster and so much higher at the cash register that they can‚Äôt afford the full cart of groceries anymore,‚Äù he said.\n\nRamaswamy had a simple answer on the economy: Increase the supply of everything‚Äîfrom energy to labor.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker\n\nDeSantis and Haley clash over fracking and the 'Green New Deal'\n\nDeSantis' pledge to \"repeal the Green New Deal\" on the \"Day One\" prompted another battle with his top rival Haley, who questioned his commitment to more energy development.\n\n\"You banned fracking,\" Haley told the Florida governor.\n\nDeSantis has said he supports fracking-style oil and gas drilling, but doesn't think it's a good idea in the Florida Everglades.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nHaley told Ramaswamy ‚Äòyou‚Äôre just scum‚Äô after he mentioned her daughter\n\nWhen asked if he supports a TikTok ban, Ramaswamy entered into a heated exchange with Haley pointing to how the former UN ambassador previously made fun of him for joining the platform to campaign. He accused Haley of allowing her daughter to use TikTok while at the same time she criticized his use of the platform.\n\n‚ÄúYou might want to take care of your family first,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúLeave my daughter out of your voice,‚Äù Haley replied, later interrupting Ramaswamy to add: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just scum.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker\n\nRepublican candidates all say they will ban TikTok\n\nAll of the candidates on stage pledged to ban TikTok, claiming it helps China spy on the United States. In doing so, it created another chance for the White House hopefuls to attack each other over China policy in general..\n\nDeSantis, Haley, and Ramaswamy all said they would be tougher on China and that the others have been too reticent about the threat posed by the Chinese.\n\nChristie used the TikTok question to attack Trump, saying he should have banned the app when he was president.\n\nTikTok \"is China trying to further divide the United States of America,\" Christie said.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nCandidates spar over funding for Ukraine\n\nAmericans are frustrated by a lack of accountability for how money is being spent by Ukraine, Tim Scott said.\n\nScott said a $106 billion funding package that President Joe Biden proposed, which included $61.4 billion to support Ukraine, is the ‚Äúwrong approach‚Äù and the U.S. should focus on providing Israel with the $14.3 billion that he requested.\n\nHitting Biden over the request, Ron DeSantis took issue to the U.S. funding Ukrainian pensions, calling it a ‚Äútotally ridiculous use‚Äù of Americans‚Äô taxpayer dollars.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy accused Ukraine hawks of ‚Äúquietly coming around‚Äù to his ‚Äúmore cautious‚Äù position on Ukraine and assailed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù and anti-democratic for saying it would not hold elections next year amid the war.\n\nHe invoked Nikki Haley, who responded by saying that the presidents of Russia and China are ‚Äúsalivating at the thought that someone like that could become president.‚Äù Haley, a former U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should give Ukraine the equipment they need to win.\n\nChris Christie said that helping Ukraine is the price that America pays to be leader of the free world.\n\n‚ÄúWe must stand with all of those that are standing up for democracy and freedom in this world,‚Äù the former New Jersey governor said.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nHaley, DeSantis and Ramaswamy mix it up over China policy\n\nThe first DeSantis-Haley dispute came over China.\n\nDeSantis stressed that Florida has banned sales of land to China; Haley noted that DeSantis' government used to do plenty of business with China.\n\nDeSantis, and Ramaswamy, also hit Haley for going soft on China during her years as U.N. ambassador.\n\nChristie admonished DeSantis, Ramaswamy, and Haley: \"These three in the middle think they are the enemy ... I know that China is the enemy.\"‚Äì David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Israel has the right to defend itself, and we will both 'smoke those terrorists'\n\nRamaswamy, who in the past has suggested cutting off aid to Israel, stayed away from that issue tonight and instead said that \"Israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself.\"\n\nThe businessman also said he would tell Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he should \"smoke those terrorists on his southern border, and as president, I'd smoke those terrorists on our southern border.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates decry anti-Semitism on college campuses\n\nMatthew Brooks, CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition, asked the candidates what they would say to Jewish students on college campuses who feel unsafe due to anti-Semitism.\n\nRamaswamy said ‚Äúanti-Semitism is a symptom of a deeper cancer‚Äù and said it would be solved with ‚Äúleadership not censorship.‚Äù Meanwhile, Scott suggested federal funding for universities and visas for foreign students could be revoked if they do not show sufficient support for Israel. He said to foreign students who are ‚Äúencouraging Jewish genocide‚Äù that he ‚Äúwould deport you from those campuses.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said he was the first presidential candidate to make that promise and said that the state of Florida took funding away for groups like Students for Justice in Palestine under his leadership.\n\nChristie recalled his time leading New Jersey following Sept. 11, 2001, protecting synagogues and mosques with police presence. ‚ÄúWe developed fabulous relationships with Muslim Americans across the State of New Jersey and we stopped any hate crimes‚Äù against Muslims or Jews, he said. ‚ÄúYou must work with both sides.‚Äù\n\nHaley said college leaders should not treat antiSemitism as less dangerous than racism: ‚ÄúIf the KKK were doing this, every college president would be up in arms. This is no different.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Riley Beggin\n\nWho is running for president in 2024?\n\nThough five Republican White House hopefuls are on stage tonight, they're not the only GOP presidential candidates.\n\nHere are the Republicans running for president next year:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nNikki Haley\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nTim Scott\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nChris Christie\n\nDoug Burgum\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nTim Scott on Israel-Hamas war: ‚ÄòCannot negotiate with evil‚Äô\n\nScott described his foreign policy as simple on the debate state Tuesday night when asked what he would tell Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n‚ÄúYou cannot negotiate with evil. You have to destroy it,‚Äù he said.\n\nScott added that he would emphasize to President Joe Biden that ‚Äúdiplomacy only is a weak strategy‚Äù and that ‚Äúappeasement leads to war.‚Äù\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nRamaswamy: Haley is Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels\n\nVivek Ramaswamy went on the offense against Nikki Haley minutes into the third debate ‚Äì lobbing a personal insult at the only female candidate on the stage.\n\nBefore the former U.N. ambassador could attack him, as she has done in previous debates, he compared her foreign policy views to those of former Republican vice president Dick Cheney as the candidates discussed Israel.\n\n‚ÄúDo you want a leader from a different generation, who‚Äôs going to put this country first? Or do you want Dick Cheney in three-inch heels?‚Äù he asked.\n\nHaley told him later that she wears ‚Äú5-inch heels‚Äù before adding, ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt wear them unless you can run in them.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI wear heels, they‚Äôre not for a fashion statement, they‚Äôre for ammunition,‚Äù Haley said.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nDeSantis to Netanyahu: ‚ÄúFinish the job once and for all‚Äù as Israel-Hamas war continues\n\nAsked what he would advise Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do following Hamas‚Äô capture and killing of Israelis on Oct. 7, DeSantis said he would advise him to ‚Äúfinish the job once and for all.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said they are ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù that would like to ‚Äúwipe every Jew off the globe.‚Äù Israel has been\n\nHe called upon Hamas to release the remaining hostages and surrender and said he‚Äôs ‚Äúsick‚Äù of hearing people ‚Äúblame Israel just for defending itself.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Riley Beggin\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, GOP candidates reflect on disappointing off-year elections: ‚ÄòParty of losers‚Äô\n\nOn the debate stage, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy lamented the string of losses Republicans have suffered in recent elections.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of Republicans losing,‚Äù DeSantis said, arguing he could end the GOP‚Äôs losing streak as the party nominee, arguing he brought the party a ‚Äúlandslide victory‚Äù in Florida in the 2022 midterms.\n\nRamaswamy on the other hand, pinned the blame on Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel for their losses, calling the GOP a ‚Äúparty of losers‚Äù and said the party is failing to bring more voters into the Republican fold.\n\n‚Äì Ken Tran\n\nGOP candidates: We would be better candidates than Trump\n\nThe first question is to all the candidates about Trump - why are you a better candidate than him?\n\nDeSantis said he has done the things Trump talks about - and is insulting voters by refusing to debate.\n\nHaley said Trump spent too much money when he was president; added that he was good for his time, but \"I don't think he's the right president now.\"\n\nRamaswamy also said that time has passed Trump by, and the Republicans have become \"a party of losers.\" He also complained about the NBC moderators, saying they should not be doing a Republican debate.\"\n\nChristie, as he often does, said Trump's legal issues make him ineligible to be president again, and the former president is too busy trying to \"stay out of jail.\"\n\nScott questioned whether Trump can win a general election.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWho are the GOP debate moderators? Kristen Welker, Lester Holt and Hugh Hewitt\n\n\"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker, \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt and radio host Hugh Hewitt will moderate the third GOP primary debate Wednesday night.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo\n\nWhere to watch the Republican debate tonight: Channel, time and more\n\nThe third Republican primary debate will air live on NBC on Wednesday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. EST as stated. The debate will also stream on NBC News NOW and NBCNews.com.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo\n\nWhere to stream Republican debate\n\nAs with the other two debates, the Republican National Committee has partnered with Rumble ‚Äî a video-sharing platform popular with some conservatives ‚Äî to livestream this one, in lieu of the network‚Äôs YouTube channel.\n\nRNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said earlier this year this was a decision aimed toward ‚Äúgetting away from Big Tech.‚Äù\n\nBut NBC says the event will air on its television, streaming and digital platforms, including streaming on NBCNews.com.\n\n‚Äì Associated Press\n\nWill Tim Scott target Donald Trump on the Republican debate stage?\n\nMatt Gorman, a senior communications adviser for Tim Scott, told NBC News that the Republican debate might be a \"slugfest\" between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"Unlike either of them, Donald Trump didn't make our political careers,\" Gorman added.\n\nThe adviser added that Scott hasn't been shy about going after his GOP rivals on abortion, Israel's ongoing war with Hamas and other contentious issues on the campaign trail.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nDebate lineup: Ron DeSantis in the middle; flanked by Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nThanks to his relatively high poll numbers, Ron DeSantis is the candidate in the middle of the five-person stage in Miami.\n\nThe Florida governor is flanked by his closest competitors, Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe lowest polling candidates, Chris Christie and Tim Scott, are at either end of the group.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWhy is Trump not at the Republican debate?\n\nTo no surprise, former president Donald Trump will not attend the third GOP primary debate in Miami.\n\nInstead the Republican frontrunner will hold a rally Wednesday night at a stadium in Hialeah, Florida, just about a half-hour drive from the debate stage in the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County.\n\n‚àí Anthony Robledo\n\nHow long is tonight's Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will last from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. It‚Äôs being moderated by NBC‚Äôs Lester Holt and Kristen Welker, as well as nationally syndicated Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nNBC says the event will air on its television, streaming and digital platforms, including streaming on NBCNews.com.\n\n‚Äì Associated Press\n\nDonald Trump's vice president pick: Tucker Carlson?\n\nSome Republicans gathered in South Florida are already talking about who Trump might pick as a running mate if he goes on to win the GOP nomination - and pre-debate chatter centered on former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nWhile he and Carlson have clashed over the years, Trump had nothing but nice things to say when asked on The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show whether he would consider him for running mate.\n\n\"I like Tucker a lot - I guess I would - I think I'd say I would because he's got great common sense,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump and his aides have also said it's way too early to discuss running mates, and he is not likely to talk down any possibility.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nWill Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley spar?\n\nOne rivalry that viewers may be watching for during the Republican debate is between Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. During the second debate, Haley told Ramaswamy that TikTok is ‚Äúone of the most dangerous social media apps‚Äù in existence before she asserted in an exasperated tone: ‚ÄúHonestly, every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.‚Äù\n\nThe political newcomer faced brunt of the blows in the first two debates, with more established Republicans on the stage, including Haley and ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, lining up to discredit the businessman.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nFollow along with the USA TODAY Fact Check Team as we dig into claims from the candidates as they make them in tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate. We'll dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check:Separating fact from fiction on Republican candidates' claims.\n\n‚Äì Eric Litke\n\nWhen is the next Republican debate? Alabama, Iowa and New Hampshire all host\n\nWhile Trump is calling for all debates to end, Republican officials in Miami say they are moving forward with plans for at least three more confrontations - whether Trump wants to show up or not.\n\nThe next debate is already on the schedule: Dec. 6 in Tuscaloosa, home of the University of Alabama. Trump is not expected to attend. The GOP is also planning debates just before the Iowa caucuses, which are on Jan. 15, and the New Hampshire primary, which is expected to be scheduled for Jan. 23.\n\nIt may be harder for Trump to snub Iowa and New Hampshire - those debates will likely be held right before people actually vote.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nGroup supporting Ron DeSantis tags Nikki Haley as ‚ÄòHillary 2.0‚Äô\n\nA political action committee that supports Ron DeSantis is taking shots at Nikki Haley ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs debate by reminding Republicans of who inspired her to run for elected office.\n\nNever Back Down released a 30-second spot featuring the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor praising Democrat Hillary Clinton on several occasions.\n\n‚ÄúI often say it‚Ä¶ the reason I got into politics was because of Hillary Clinton,‚Äù Haley says in the video.\n\nHaley, the only woman in the 2024 race, did credit Clinton for inspiring on numerous occassions during a 2012 book tour. She noted how Clinton, who ran for president in 2016, was a keynote speaker when she as a student at Birmingham University.\n\nThe attack is part of a larger offensive DeSantis and his allies have waged against the former UN ambassador, who has climbed in the polls and emerged as the likely new No. 2 in the GOP field.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nChris Christie, Nikki Haley issue dueling taunts before Republican debate\n\nNikki Haley and Chris Christie both took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to share a message of confidence heading into the GOP debate.\n\n\"I've never lost a race, I'm not going to start now,\" Haley shared before the event, alongside a video of her campaigning.\n\nThe former New Jersey governor also posted \"Let's win the damn thing.\"\n\n‚àí Marina Pitofsky\n\nPre-Republican debate atmosphere in Miami? Pretty low-key\n\nYou might expect a laid back atmosphere in Miami, even for a presidential candidates' debate.\n\nAnd that's what you've got: Streets are blocked off and fencing is in place around the debate site, but there are few people milling around and almost no demonstrators.\n\nQuite a difference from the street fairs and protesters who surrounded the Milwaukee arena that hosted the first Republican debate back in August.\n\nThe second debate in September did not draw many bystanders, but that was held at the Ronald Reagan library on top of a mountain in California.\n\nAs night fell on sun-bleached Miami, a bicyclist carried a Trump 2024 flag. A man in a lawn chair at a street intersection held a sign that read \"Trump or World War III.\"\n\nTrump himself, meanwhile, planned to host his own campaign rally in nearby Hialeah, Fla. On the other side of the Miami concert hall where the debate will be held, a lone man dressed a rat suit carried a sign that read \"RAT: Republicans Against Trump.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nWill Republican hopefuls address Glenn Youngkin, Andy Beshear and other 2023 races?\n\nOne thing viewers could keep an eye out for tonight is whether the Republican candidates address GOP losses after Election Day 2023.\n\nVirginia Democrats took control of the state's legislature, and they're expected to block Gov. Glenn Youngkin's conservative agenda. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear also won reelection on Tuesday and defeated his Republican challenger.\n\nAnd in Ohio, voters passed a ballot measure to protect abortion rights, a push supported by Republicans in the Buckeye State.\n\nThe GOP hopefuls participating in Wednesday's Republican debate may be pitching their vision for the nation, as well as a vision for the future of the Republican Party at the state and local level.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nAdrienne Arsht Center: Where is the Republican debate tonight being held?\n\nThe Republican debate will be held at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County.\n\n‚Äì Haadiza Ogwude and Anthony Robledo\n\nWhat time does the GOP debate start?\n\nThe third GOP primary debate will occur on Wednesday, Nov. 8 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. EST in Miami.\n\n‚Äì Anthony Robledo\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nTrump‚Äôs various indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him, while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has warned that Trump's legal troubles could cost GOP the 2024 presidential election. And Christie, one of Trump's most vocal critics, has forecasted that the former president will be convicted, even as he seeks a second term in the White House.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDebate control: Republican Party tells candidates not to participate in Iowa forum\n\nSeeking to maintain control of the debate process, the Republican National Committee is warning presidential candidates not to participate in an Iowa forum scheduled for later this month - or face exclusion from future RNC debates.\n\nIn a letter to the various campaigns, the RNC said it regards a ‚ÄúThanksgiving Family Forum‚Äù sponsored by Iowa‚Äôs Family Leader Foundation as a debate in all but name.\n\nCandidates have pledged not to participate in non-RNC debates. Said the letter: ‚ÄúPlease be advised that any Republican presidential candidate who participates in this or other similar events will be deemed to have violated this pledge and will be disqualified from taking part in any future RNC-sanctioned presidential primary debates.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nHere‚Äôs where GOP candidates stand on China and a potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that‚Äôs where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the ‚Äúmost dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war‚Äù and said it‚Äôs clear that Beijing is preparing for war.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, ‚Äúbut if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.‚Äù\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has previously said he would aggressively defend Taiwan ‚Äì but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for ‚Äúsome nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nWho is in the Republican debate tonight?\n\nFive Republican candidates qualified for the third Republican debate tonight, a smaller field than the previous events. They include:\n\nWill there be a Democratic debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley has often argued that leaders need to find consensus on the issue of abortion, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie, have said they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n‚Äì Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhen is the Republican convention?\n\nTonight's debate isn't part of the Republican convention, where an official GOP nominee will be chosen for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican convention is set for July 2024 at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is expected to be a major swing state heading into the race for the White House.\n\n‚àí Marina Pitofsky\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv‚Äôs counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia‚Äôs violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äô description of the conflict as a ‚Äúterritorial dispute‚Äù helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a ‚Äúwar criminal.‚Äù Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nTim Scott invites Jewish students to Republican debate\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott on Wednesday shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he invited a group of Jewish students to attend the debate in Miami.\n\n\"As hate and anti-Semitism proliferate on college campuses, it is more important than ever to educate the minds of our next generation with thoughtful debate and discussion,\" Scott shared.\n\nThe move comes as American colleges have reported a surge in crimes that appeared to target Jewish and Muslim people as the war between Israel and Hamas continues.\n\n‚àí Marina Pitofsky, Krystal Nurse, Eduardo Cuevas and Vanessa Arredondo\n\nNikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are feuding\n\nThe 2024 Republican presidential campaign trail is becoming increasingly icy, and it‚Äôs not because of dropping temperatures.\n\nAmid their battle for second place in the GOP primary race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have heightened attacks against one another on everything from their foreign policy stances to footwear choices.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu described the frosty relationship between the two candidates as getting ‚Äúa bit chippy‚Äù after appearing with Haley at an event.\n\nBut the campaign jabs aren‚Äôt necessarily scoring the candidates any wins with voters in early primary states. Voters USA TODAY spoke with said they haven't paid much attention to the back-and-forth between the two candidates.\n\n‚àí Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat are the stakes for tonight's Republican debate?\n\nRepublican White House hopefuls not named Donald Trump will assemble in Miami this week for the third presidential primary debate. But what does each candidates need to do to break out? Here's a look at a few contenders:\n\nNikki Haley: Given how much the world stage has consumed the country, Washington and campaign trail, expect Haley's quick-witted acumen to seize the microphone when America's standing and role in the world comes up.\n\nRon DeSantis: DeSantis will have to stiff arm Haley while also making the case that something has changed enough for him to be a serious threat to Trump.‚àí\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The biggest challenge for Ramaswamy, whose ideas and rhetoric might excite some in the GOP base, will be showing a more personal side that can close that likability gap with those same voters.‚Äì Phillip M. Bailey\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n‚ÄúIt's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,‚Äù then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation‚Äôs highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. ‚Äì John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans - a move that 2024 GOP candidates applauded and has become a contentious point of debate.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president ‚Äúcannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.‚Äù South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court‚Äôs decision.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,‚Äù Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill GOP election losses take center stage at tonight's Republican debate?\n\nMost of the pre-debate buzz in Miami centers on Republican reversals in Tuesday's off-year elections - and debaters plan to argue that they are the answer to the party's ills.\n\nHaley and her aides cite her strong poll numbers against President Joe Biden and stress that Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight elections.\n\n\"Isn't it time we had a Republican who can win a general election?\" the Haley campaign said in a statement.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, cites the fact that he won re-election as governor of Florida in a landslide, and has turned a former battleground state into a Republican-leaning one.\n\nTrump, who is holding a competing rally near the debate site, is being blamed for some of the GOP losses, But he is laying it on establishment Republicans like Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nCiting the GOP candidate who lost the Kentucky's governor race, Trump said on Truth Social: \"Daniel Cameron lost because he couldn‚Äôt alleviate the stench of Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nOf course, Trump also endorsed Cameron.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nGOP presidential polls ahead of the third GOP debate\n\nAll of the candidates on the debate stage Wednesday night are trailing former President Donald Trump in state and national polls.\n\nAccording to a Real Clear Politics average of GOP primary polls, Trump leads the crowded Republican field with 58.3% support, followed by DeSantis at 14.6%. Haley has garnered 9.4% support, while Ramaswamy has received 4.4%.\n\nDuring the debate, the Republican White House hopefuls will be looking for breakout moments to connect with voters and potentially boost their support across the country.\n\n‚Äì Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow did GOP candidates qualify for the Republican debate\n\nCandidates had to meet a higher bar to participate in the third debate than the first two. White House hopefuls must have polled at least 4% in two national polls or 4% in one national poll and one early state poll from states recognized by the committee.\n\nThey must also have had a minimum of 70,000 unique donors and signed the ‚ÄúBeat Biden‚Äù pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/17/first-gop-presidential-debate-aug-23/70405173007/", "title": "First GOP presidential debate: Here's a rundown of who will qualify", "text": "WASHINGTON - As the 2024 presidential election heats up, Republicans vying for the White House are preparing to face off during the first GOP primary debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee ‚àí the largest city in the key battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nBut who will qualify for a spot on stage?\n\nThe Republican National Committee set forth requirements in June that candidates must meet on status, polling, fundraising and pledging to take part in the debate.\n\nHow it works: Candidates must poll at least 1% in three national polls or 1% in two national polls and 1% from an early state poll from two ‚Äúcarve out‚Äù states recognized by the committee.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCandidates must also have a minimum of 40,000 unique donors part of their presidential campaign committee - with at least 200 unique donors per state - and sign a pledge agreeing to support the eventual party nominee.\n\nWhile top candidates in the Republican primary polls have qualified for a spot, other lesser-known candidates are struggling to make headway. Some candidates have refused to participate altogether.\n\nHere are the candidates who are on track to qualify for the first debate:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nTim Scott\n\nChris Christie\n\nHere are the candidates still working on qualifying:\n\nMike Pence\n\nWill Hurd\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nLarry Elder\n\nHere‚Äôs a deeper rundown of which Republican hopefuls might make an appearance ‚àí and which ones might not ‚àí on debate night.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump ‚àí the GOP frontrunner ‚àí will qualify for the debate.\n\nA survey from Morning Consult shows Trump has 56% of support from potential GOP voters, and he‚Äôs placed first in other national and state polls. His campaign said that he has also raised more than $35 million during the second quarter of the year - about twice the amount raised during the first quarter, Politico first reported.\n\nBut whether Trump will participate is still up in the air.\n\nTrump threatened to skip the debate in late June claiming on Truth Social that Fox News, one of the event‚Äôs sponsors, ignored his campaign events. He suggested to Fox News host Bret Baier on his show \"Special Report\" last month that he didn't want to spar with low-polling candidates.\n\n\"They're all very low,\" Trump said. \"So why would I allow people at one or two percent, at zero percent, to be hitting me with questions all night? You know, I don't think it's fair.\"\n\nHe's also considered scheduling a competing event for that night, according to NBC News.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who‚Äôs trailing behind Trump in the Republican primary polls, will hit the debate stage.\n\nHis campaign announced he raised more than $20 million during the first six weeks of his candidacy and has about 50,000 donors as of late June, according to the New York Times. The survey from Morning Consult shows that DeSantis has garnered 17% of support among potential GOP voters.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview two weeks ago with Fox News host Will Cain he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\n‚ÄúI hope everybody who's eligible comes,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúI think it's an important part of the process and I look forward to being able to be on the stage and introducing our candidacy and our vision and our leadership to a wide audience.‚Äù\n\nLast month, DeSantis dodged the question of whether he would support Trump if he becomes the nominee in 2024. However, DeSantis later said that he didn‚Äôt avoid the question and would \"respect the outcome of the process,\" according to The Hill.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nFormer Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on track to meet the requirements for the debate.\n\nHaley‚Äôs spokesperson told USA TODAY that she has ‚Äúwell over 40,000 unique donors‚Äù and is ‚Äúlooking forward to being on the debate stage.‚Äù The New York Times reported she‚Äôs raised over $7.3 million through her campaign and affiliated committees between April and June.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows she has registered 3% of support among GOP voters, which is on par with two of her rivals. She‚Äôs also maintained scoring above 1% in other polls.\n\nHaley indicated on Twitter she plans on supporting the eventual nominee for the Republican party.\n\n‚ÄúAbsolutely irresponsible that Trump, DeSantis, and others won't commit 100% to supporting the Republican nominee,‚Äù Haley tweeted. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no room for personal vendettas in this battle to save our country.‚Äù\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has fulfilled the debate criteria, according to his spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\nMcLaughlin told USA TODAY that Ramaswamy has 65,000 donors. As part of his fundraising strategy, Ramaswamy has laid out incentives for supporters such as offering to give them a 10% cut of the total money he raises for his presidential bid, according to Axios.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Ramaswamy has received 8% support from GOP voters, surpassing former Vice President Mike Pence and trailing behind DeSantis. He‚Äôs also starting to receive double-digit figures in some polls.\n\nRamaswamy will take the loyalty pledge if the other candidates do, McLaughlin said.\n\nMike Pence\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who filed to run for president last month, is facing difficulty meeting the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has gained 7% support among voters, trailing behind Ramaswamy, and he's maintained over 1% support in other polls. However, the New York Times reported last week he has not yet received donations from 40,000 unique donors.\n\nHe‚Äôs also raised less than $1.2 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year ‚àí far below what his rivals have raised, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDespite announcing his candidacy late compared to his rivals, Pence ‚àí a familiar face among voters ‚àí has already garnered attention from voters as he campaigns across key states and maintains a critical position against Trump‚Äôs stances on abortion, immigration, criminal justice and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nPence said in a CNN town hall last month in Iowa he would support whoever ends up being the Republican nominee in 2024.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott said during an interview last month on Fox News‚Äô ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Newsroom‚Äù that he's met the requirements for the debate.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he‚Äôs scored 3% support among GOP voters, and he‚Äôs also maintained an average 3.2% of support in the Republican primary polls, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nScott‚Äôs campaign told the New York Post they‚Äôve been backed by 40,000 donors in early July and announced Wednesday that they‚Äôve raised $6.1 million in the second quarter of fundraising, according to The Hill.\n\nScott indicated in a Fox News interview in May he will support the eventual nominee, saying ‚Äúall Republican candidates would be better than any Democrat candidate.‚Äù\n\nChris Christie\n\nFormer Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has qualified for the debate.\n\nHe told CNN host Anderson Cooper on Wednesday he‚Äôs received more than 40,000 unique donors in just 35 days.

But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America‚Äôs oldest unions and the world‚Äôs biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract‚Äôs expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n‚ÄúThe question is how long it will be,‚Äù said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. ‚ÄúThe union‚Äôs president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they‚Äôre very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.‚Äù\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation‚Äôs gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation‚Äôs struggling supply chain. Beyond the company‚Äôs home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Starbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021) 02:06 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that‚Äôs growing fast ‚Äî the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon‚Äôs own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n‚ÄúWe want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,‚Äù the company said in a statement this month. ‚ÄúUPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we‚Äôll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that‚Äôs good for everyone involved.‚Äù\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation‚Äôs history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union ‚Äî both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union‚Äôs new president, Sean O‚ÄôBrien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n‚ÄúDo our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I‚Äôd say no. But are they fed up? Yes they‚Äôre fed up,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien told CNN Business last week. ‚ÄúWhether or not there is a strike, that‚Äôs totally up to the company. We‚Äôre going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.‚Äù\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS‚Äô semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That‚Äôs far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O‚ÄôBrien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of heat stroke going on.‚Äù\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way ‚Äì employment numbers ‚Äì UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone keeps getting richer except for our members,‚Äù said O‚ÄôBrien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company‚Äôs union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n‚ÄúOur goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,‚Äù she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is ‚Äúbuilding contingency plans.‚Äù", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/media/new-york-times-strike/index.html", "title": "New York Times journalists stage historic 24-hour strike after ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nA 24-hour strike at The New York Times, a historic demonstration in which more than 1,100 employees are expected to participate, began Thursday at midnight, after management and the union representing staffers failed to reach an agreement for a new contract after more than a year and a half of negotiating.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing that they‚Äôre taking such drastic action, given the clear commitment we‚Äôve shown to negotiate our way to a contract that provides Times journalists with substantial pay increases, market-leading benefits, and flexible working conditions,‚Äù Meredith Kopit Levien, president and chief executive of The Times, said in an email to the company Wednesday night.\n\nThe NewsGuild of New York, which represents journalists and other staffers at The Times, said in a statement that the walkout was ‚Äúdue to the company‚Äôs failure to bargain in good faith, reach a fair contract agreement with the workers, and meet their demands.‚Äù\n\nThe act of protest, which has not been staged by employees at the newspaper of record in decades, will leave many of its major desks depleted of their staff, creating a challenge for the news organization that millions of readers rely on.\n\nStacy Cowley holds a sign outside the New York Times building in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 8, 2022.

Last Friday, the NewsGuild informed The Times about its plans to stage a walkout, a move aimed at applying pressure to management to offer additional concessions in negotiations.\n\nThe union has asked The Times to meet in the middle on wage increases, but the newspaper believes the union started from an extreme position, making doing so a non-starter.\n\nBoth sides have worked throughout the week to avert the 24-hour strike.

But thanks to a nearly century-old law that regulates labor relations only when it comes to railroads and airlines, what otherwise would be strictly an economic issue became a political one.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 as one of the very first labor laws in the nation. At that point most of the railroads already had been unionized, some all the way back to the mid-19th century. The structure was therefore set up to regulate labor negotiations between unions and management, rather than oversee organizing campaigns for new unions and additional members.\n\nBecause of the law, the House was able to vote Wednesday to impose unpopular contracts on four rail unions whose members have already rejected the terms, followed by a vote by the Senate vote late Thursday that did the same.\n\nThe measure now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. When he does, there will no longer be a chance of a Dec. 9 strike that would have shut down about 30% of the nation‚Äôs freight shipments. A prolonged strike would have caused shortage of a wide range of items, from food to gasoline to automobiles, and likely resulted in a spike in prices.\n\nA group of steam locomotives pour steam and smoke into the air in St. Paul, Minnesota in this file photo from 1925. The Railway Labor Act, passed in 1926, is the reason Congress could intervene this week to block a strike by freight railroad unions. Minnesota Historical Society/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe House also passed a law that would give the unions paid sick days, addressing the issue they said led members to reject the deals. But the efforts to pass that same measure in the Senate fell short, even though 52 of 95 senators voted for it. The measure needed 60 votes to pass the senate.\n\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, the federal agency that oversees railroad and airline labor relations is the National Mediation Board, which tries to bring the two sides together, and it set up a series of limits and cooling off periods during which unions can not strike and management can not lock out the workers. And if all those efforts fail, then Congress can step in and impose a contract under which both sides will have to operate.\n\nIn negotiations at other businesses, the workers‚Äô ability to strike is the most powerful option unions have to achieve their goals at the bargaining table. And even the railroads admit that the law makes strikes extremely unlikely.\n\n‚ÄúThe goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,‚Äù said Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the railroads. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs been remarkably effective in doing that.‚Äù\n\nAs much as management likes the law and its limits on strikes, the unions hate it. They say it would be far easier to reach a deal that their members can support if they had the leverage of a possible strike. And they say that management, when weighing the cost of that possible strike, would realize that they have the resources needed to meet those demands without an actual work stoppage.\n\nThe four major railroads ‚Äî Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)‚Äôs Burlington Northern Santa Fe ‚Äî reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three railroads they cover.\n\nIf they were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the labor law that oversees worker-management relations at most of the nation‚Äôs businesses, the unions could threaten to go on strike. But under the Railway Labor Act, management can fall back on hopes that Congress will give them the deal it wants.\n\n‚ÄúThis action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to‚Ä¶do the right thing,‚Äù said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted against the tentative agreements reached last fall that Congress is now poised to impose on members.\n\nThe railroads deny they wanted this to end up with Congress, and they preferred to reach a deal with the unions that could be ratified by membership.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,‚Äù said AAR‚Äôs Jefferies.\n\nBut Biden, in his statement calling on Congress to act to impose the rejected tentative agreements on the rail workers to keep them on the job, seemed to acknowledge that there was no chance that rail management would reach a deal with the unions.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table.‚Äù\n\nThe railroads refused to accept union demands for paid sick days. Jefferies also said the railroads would only agree to make changes in sick day rules if it was within the ‚Äúframework‚Äù of the proposal put forth by a presidential panel this summer that was charged with trying to find a compromise agreement.\n\nThat means for the unions to get the sick pay they wanted, they‚Äôd have to give up some other pay or benefit in order to keep the overall economics of the package unchanged. The likelihood that Congress will impose a deal along the lines of the presidential panel‚Äôs recommendations, or the tentative agreements, means that management has little incentive to agree to union demands.\n\nThe decision to urge Congress to take action was politically difficult for Biden, who is often referred to as the most pro-union president in recent history. When he served in the Senate, Biden voted against an earlier effort to impose a contract on the rail unions to keep them on the job.\n\n‚ÄúAs a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,‚Äù he said in his statement Monday night calling for Congressional action.\n\nBut he said he couldn‚Äôt ignore the economic upheaval that a rail strike could cause, and that he had no choice but to turn to Congress and the powers it has.\n\n‚ÄúIn this case ‚Äì where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families ‚Äì I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal,‚Äù he said.\n\nAnd he said the deals, while they weren‚Äôt everything the unions wanted, were good ones for the unions, with the biggest pay increases in more than 50 years, and some improvements in other contract terms.\n\n‚ÄúOn the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight unions and the companies in that industry,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúThe agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.‚Äù\n\nBut the unions and their allies say that it‚Äôs wrong to force members to accept a deal they rejected because it denies the workers the basic sick days they are demanding.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,‚Äù said a group of a dozen Democratic senators, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. ‚ÄúGuaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year ‚Äì less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.‚Äù\n\nBut only 4 of the 12 senators who issued the statement - Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - voted against imposing the unpopular contracts. The other eight who signed onto the statement - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Alex Padilla of California, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island - all joined in the 80-15 vote in favor of imposing the contracts to block the strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/10/19/uaw-strike-gm-says-it-cant-meet-demands-without-devastating-effect/71240679007/", "title": "UAW strike: GM says it can't meet demands without 'devastating' effect", "text": "A General Motors executive said Thursday that the company cannot meet all of the UAW's demands in the ongoing strike without a \"devastating\" impact on jobs.\n\nIn a video, published on www.gmnegotiations2023.com, Gerald Johnson, GM's executive vice president of global manufacturing and sustainability, outlined the automaker's current offer to the United Auto Workers, sending the message that GM feels it has a compelling and \"historic\" offer already on the table.

The rank-and-file members of the nation‚Äôs largest rail union, which represents the industry‚Äôs conductors, rejected a tentative labor deal with freight railroads, the union announced Monday.\n\nThe nation‚Äôs second-largest rail union, which represents engineers, ratified its own contract. But the failure of the conductors to ratify their deal is another setback to efforts to avoid a strike.\n\nWith these votes, all 12 rail unions have now completed their ratification process, with members of eight of the unions voting in favor of deals and four voting against it. The four unions that have voted no will remain on the job until at least early next month while negotiations are held to try to avoid a strike that could cause widespread disruptions in the nation‚Äôs still struggling supply chain and overall economy.\n\nIf even one of the dozen railroad unions were to go on strike, the other 11 would honor the picket lines, shutting down the railroads.\n\nIf a strike goes on for an extended period, it could cause shortages and higher prices for goods including fuel and food. If the four unions that rejected the deals are unable to reach new deals before strike deadlines, Congress could order the railroad workers to remain on the job or return to work.\n\nThe two unions that released voting results Monday are the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, Transportation union (SMART-TD), which represents about 28,000 conductors and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents about 24,000 engineers. The engineers and conductors make up the two-person train crews.\n\nBoth unions reached tentative deals in September in a marathon 20-hour negotiating session just hours before their earlier strike deadlines.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called those deals ‚Äúa win for tens of thousands of rail workers and for their dignity and the dignity of their work.‚Äù He had directly intervened in the final round of talks, but his praise of the deals wasn‚Äôt enough to win approval from rank-and-file members of the conductors‚Äô union.\n\nThe deals nearly got the support they needed to be ratified by both unions. One was ratified by the engineers, with 53.5% voting yes, while the other was a very slim defeat by the conductors with either a small majority or a near majority voting for ratification.\n\nThe conductors‚Äô vote ultimately failed because the union‚Äôs rules require each of five classes of workers within the union to approve the deal for it to pass.\n\nAlthough 64.5% of ‚Äúyardmasters,‚Äù which includes 1,300 of the union‚Äôs membership, supported the deal, 50.87% members of train and engine service members of the union voted against ratification. The union did not release the overall vote totals for SMART-TD members.\n\nThe no vote follow similar contract rejections by the rank-and-file members of three other rail unions ‚Äì one representing track maintenance workers, another whose members maintain and operate the signal system, and a third who represent locomotive mechanics and welders.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, the industry trade group, told CNN last week that the railroads are still hopeful of reaching new deals that can be ratified by membership without a strike taking place. It repeated that hope Monday after the latest vote.\n\n‚ÄúWhile railroads remain committed to reaching agreements with these remaining unions, the timeline for those to occur is short,‚Äù said the AAR‚Äôs statement.\n\nOne of those unions which earlier rejected its deal, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED), announced Monday it was moving its strike date back to Dec. 9, to be in sync with the strike date for the conductors and one of the other unions.\n\nAnd it suggested all four unions should negotiate together ahead of a common Dec. 9 strike date.\n\nThe one union that might go on strike before Dec. 9, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen [BRS], could go on strike at 12:01 am ET on Dec. 5. Last week the BRS President Michael Baldwin told CNN the union did not intend to push back its strike deadline ‚Äúat this time.‚Äù\n\nLucrative deals get rejected\n\nEven within many of the unions that voted in favor of the deals, there was significant opposition, as was shown in the 46.5% of engineers who voted no.\n\nThe deals being voted down are lucrative for union members. They include an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating to 2020, as well as pay raises totaling 24% during the four-year life of the contracts, which run through 2024. Union members also would receive cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nAll told, the backpay and bonuses will give union members an average payment of $11,000 per worker once the deal is ratified.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not the pay that has been the sticking point in the negotiations. It‚Äôs the work rules and quality of life issues, such as staffing levels and paid sick time, which the tentative agreements do not include.\n\nSo far railroad management has rejected proposals from union negotiators to add sick pay as a way to win ratification from the rank and file.\n\nCongressional action possible\n\nCongress is already facing calls from a wide range of business groups to act to prevent a strike. About 30% of the nation‚Äôs freight moves by rail, when measured by the weight of the freight and the distance it travels.\n\nThe AAR joined those calls for Congressional action if new deals can‚Äôt be reached.\n\n‚ÄúCongress has historically intervened to prevent rail system disruptions. In the event that the four unions remain unwilling to enter agreements ‚Ä¶ Congress must be prepared to act and institute the terms supported by the majority of the unions, guaranteeing certainty for rail customers and the broader economy,‚Äù it said in its statement.\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh, who was involved in the negotiations that reached the deals that averted a strike back in September, told CNN earlier this month that while he prefers to reach a new round of negotiated agreements, it would be necessary for Congress to act to prevent a strike.\n\nThe White House said Monday they are looking to labor and industry parties involved in negotiations to resolve a rail dispute on their own ahead of a critical December deadline.\n\n‚ÄúAs the President has said from the beginning, a shutdown is unacceptable because of the harm it would inflict on jobs, families, farms, businesses and communities across the country,‚Äù a White House official told CNN.\n\nThe official added: ‚ÄúA majority of unions have voted to ratify the tentative agreement, and the best option is still for the parties to resolve this themselves.‚Äù\n\nAsked Monday by CNN‚Äôs Jeremy Diamond what he was doing to avert a rail strike, President Biden responded, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be talking about that today.‚Äù\n\nBut unlike July, when Biden was able to block the unions from going on strike by naming a panel to try to come up with a solution both sides could live with, it now rests with Congress, not Biden, to act if new labor deals can not be reached.\n\nThe unions are all opposed to Congressional intervention and want to be allowed to strike to raise pressure on the railroads to achieve their bargaining goals, though they would not be opposed to the Labor Department once again facilitating negotiations.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think it should require the influence or cajoling of any outside party to get the railroads to be reasonable on behalf of their business or workers,‚Äù said the BMWED in a statement. ‚ÄúBut it would be helpful for these third parties to start to facilitate the discussion. It‚Äôs clear railroads won‚Äôt engaged with us meaningfully unless they are forced to.\n\nAn added challenge: it would take bipartisan cooperation in the ‚ÄúLame Duck‚Äù session of congress to pass legislation that will prevent or quickly end a strike.\n\n‚Äì CNN‚Äôs Betsy Klein and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/08/sag-aftra-strike-ends-with-tentative-deal-studios/71050537007/", "title": "Actors strike ends: SAG-AFTRA reaches tentative deal with studios", "text": "Hollywood actors will return to work on TV and movies: The actors' union's negotiating team on Wednesday reached a tentative agreement with the group representing studios and streamers, ending a historic 118-day strike that began July 14.\n\nThe 160,000-member Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) agreed to a new three-year contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) representing eight major studios and streamers including Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Amazon.\n\n\"We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP,\" SAG-AFTRA announced late Wednesday. \"As of 12:01 a.m. (PST) on November 9, our strike is officially over and all picket locations are suspended.\"\n\nThe deal will allow studios to resume production of TV shows and movies that has been largely shuttered for the past six months, ever since the Writers Guild of America began its own walkout on May 2.\n\nAbout 60,000 members of the union were affected by the strike. The union membership will schedule a vote in the coming days to formally authorize the deal, putting actors one step closer to stepping in front of the cameras again. It's likely that broadcast networks can salvage part of the 2023-24 TV season by airing some new episodes of scripted series as early as February, while movies can restart production to fill a depleted pipeline.\n\nAfter two and a half months of striking without negotiations, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP first met on Oct. 2, but talks fell through when the AMPTP walked away on Oct. 11. Studio representatives said that \"conversations (were) no longer moving us in a productive direction.\"\n\nBargaining resumed on Oct. 24 and included major executives from four Hollywood studios as the two sides tried to hammer out a deal.\n\nThe upshot:Actors strike ends, but what's next? Here's when you can expect your shows and movies back\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher was ready for a 'long-haul' strike\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, star of the hit '90s sitcom \"The Nanny,\" said in July that the union was ready for a \"long haul\" strike to achieve demands that included increased actors' salaries and basing actors' compensation on the success of their shows and movies on streaming services. Protections against the studios' use of Artificial Intelligence and digital replicas of actors were also among the union's priorities, but the studios initially bristled at many of the union's asks before reaching a compromise.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA statement said the contract, valued at over $1 billion, achieved pay raises, unprecedented provisions to protect members from the threat of AI, and a new \"streaming participation bonus,\" among other benefits. \"We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,\" the union's statement said. Many thousands of performers now and into the future will benefit from this work.\"\n\nThe studio group called the agreement \"a new paradigm\" and said the AMPTP \"is pleased to have reached a tentative agreement and looks forward to the industry resuming the work of telling great stories.\"\n\nFor much of the summer, actors shared the picket line with WGA members, who were on strike for 148 days. The dual actors' and writers' strikes brought Hollywood movie and TV production to a standstill throughout the summer and fall.\n\nThe WGA leadership voted Sept. 27 to affirm a deal with the AMPTP, bringing some TV shows back on air, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" daytime and late-night talk shows such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\nThe WGA congratulated SAG-AFTRA on the deal on the union's official X account, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see SAG-AFTRA members win a contract that creates new protections for performers and gives them a greater share of the immense value they create,\" the statement said.\n\nWriters strike officially endsHollywood writers ratify new contract with studios", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/09/14/uaw-strike-union-automakers-contract-talks-fail/70859818007/", "title": "UAW strike: Workers at 3 plants in 3 states launch historic action ...", "text": "DETROIT ‚Äî The United Auto Workers launched a historic strike late Thursday by targeting all three Detroit automakers at once after contract negotiations failed to land a new deal.\n\nUAW members at three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri went on strike after their labor contracts expired at 11:59 p.m. The UAW confirmed that about 13,000 members across the three plants are walking the picket lines.\n\nAs the deadline for a new contract passed, cheering could be heard from inside the gates at Stellantis' Toledo Assembly Complex as cars and trucks streamed out and honking horns provided the soundtrack. At Ford Motor Co.'s Michigan Assembly in Wayne, union strikers cheered: \"We love you, Shawn, we love you,\" when UAW President Shawn Fain arrived after midnight to join the picket line. He stayed until after 1 a.m. and told members, \"I work for you.\"\n\nIn Wayne, only the Final Assembly and Paint portion of the facility was targeted. The third plant in what was branded as the first wave of walkouts was General Motors' Wentzville Assembly in Missouri.\n\nThe strike, which the union is calling the \"Stand Up Strike,\" is targeting specific plants of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Fiat brands. Union leaders have said they will select new target plants to take out on strike in various waves if negotiations continue to fail to land new agreements with the auto companies. The strategy is designed to keep the automakers off-guard and leverage the union's position to secure a better contract than the offers the Detroit automakers have made so far.\n\n\"This strategy will keep the companies guessing. It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining. And if we need to go all out, we will. Everything is on the table,\" Fain said in a late night livestream to members on Facebook Live.\n\n‚ÄúNo matter what, all of us need to keep organizing: Rallies, protests, red shirt days,‚Äù Fain said during the broadcast. ‚ÄúWe must show the companies you are ready to join and stand up and fight on a moment‚Äôs notice.‚Äù\n\nHis comments came near the end of a day of last-minute bargaining that ultimately stalled. The UAW has been negotiating with all three carmakers separately, yet simultaneously, since late summer.\n\nAutomakers react in disappointment\n\nShortly before midnight, GM sent out a statement saying the union informed the automaker it was on strike at Wentzville Assembly as of 11:59 PM.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the UAW leadership's actions, despite the unprecedented economic package GM put on the table, including historic wage increases and manufacturing commitments,\" GM said in the statement. \"We will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible for the benefit of our team members, customers, suppliers and communities across the U.S. In the meantime, our priority is the safety of our workforce.‚Äù\n\nStellantis also sent a statement: \"We are extremely disappointed by the UAW leadership's refusal to engage in a responsible manner to reach a fair agreement in the best interest of our employees, their families and our customers. We immediately put the Company in contingency mode and will take all the appropriate structural decisions to protect our North American operations and the Company.\"\n\nFord did not immediately provide a comment.\n\nCheering crowds at striking plants\n\nJust before midnight, a man in his white GMC pickup delivered firewood to the Toledo Assembly Complex for the burn barrel that was just bursting to flame. He didn‚Äôt want to give his name but said he works mornings at the plant building Jeeps and, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to make sure people stay warm,‚Äù he said.\n\nOutside Michigan Assembly in Wayne, striking workers carried signs reading, ‚ÄúUAW on Strike‚Äù and others with the phrase, ‚ÄúSaving the American Dream.‚Äù\n\nParking lots across the street from Michigan Assembly rapidly filled as UAW members arrived cheering and chanting and singing and shouting. They carried signs and created a sea of red in their union shirts. Cars and trucks honked while passing.\n\nWhen Fain arrived after the midnight deadline, an animated crowd of people quickly surrounded him and cheered. One man remarked that even at six foot four inches, he couldn‚Äôt see Fain in the crush of people surrounding the union leader.\n\nMembers shouted, ‚ÄúWe love you, Shawn, we love you.‚Äù\n\n'We gave up a lot'\n\nThe striking workers have their own reasons for wanting to walk out.\n\nDwayne Walker, 60, president of UAW Local 900, stood at the picket line in Wayne late Thursday. Local 900 has about 5500 members, he said, 4,000 of whom are now on strike at Michigan Assembly.\n\nOur motive is not a labor strike,‚Äù Walker said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to accomplish some things.‚Äù\n\nJoel Ventimeglia, 46, of St. Clair Shores, said he inspects Bronco and Ranger vehicles on the line, and has worked for Ford at Michigan Assembly for 11 years. His reasons for walking the line are simple, ‚ÄúWe gave up a lot a long time ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just want what‚Äôs fair.‚Äù\n\nBut one argument some analysts have made is that if they give the union members all they ask, prices for new vehicles, especially electric cars, will have to go up.\n\nSupplemental work is 'hell'\n\nBack in Toledo, Leticia Lopez, 38, of Toledo has been a supplemental worker at the Toledo Assembly Complex for four years. She's one of 1,400 supplemental workers there, she said. Before that, she‚Äôd been a supplemental worker for 3 ¬Ω years at GM.\n\nEarly Friday morning, she stood outside her plant cheering. She‚Äôs been waiting, she said, for this moment. Working as a supplemental worker at the plant is more than difficult.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hell,‚Äù Lopez said, noting that during the pandemic, when others stayed home if they needed to, supplemental workers ‚Äúwere stuck in here,‚Äù she said, pointing to the plant.\n\nThe mother of seven said she stays at her job for the health care, which is free, but it doesn‚Äôt come with dental or vision coverage. Her current pay is $17 an hour and she said there‚Äôs no pathway to a permanent spot.\n\nDawnya Ferdinandsen, 54, of Sandusky stood outside the Toledo Assembly Complex cheering on the cars and trucks as they honked and sped by.\n\n‚ÄúBlow that horn, that‚Äôs it,‚Äù she said.\n\nFerdinandsen works at the GM Propulsion plant in Toledo but came to the Stellantis plant in solidarity.\n\n‚ÄúThey supported us when we went out,‚Äù she said, referencing the 2019 strike against GM when workers from Ford and Stellantis, then Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, would join the picketers outside the GM plants during their free time.\n\nBiden defends UAW:Biden defends UAW right to strike; tells auto industry to share profits with workers\n\nWhat is the UAW?What to know about the union at the heart of industry-wide autoworkers strike\n\nSpur negotiations rather than paralyze'\n\nStellantis makes its popular Jeep Wrangler, Wrangler 4xe, and Jeep Gladiator pickups at the Toledo Complex. At Michigan Assembly, formerly called Michigan Truck Plant, Ford builds the Ranger mid-size pickup and the Bronco SUV. Wentzville Assembly in Missouri is where GM builds the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups and the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans.\n\n\"At this point, the three assembly plants that will walk out are a dramatic shot across the bow,\" said labor expert Harley Shaiken, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The closure creates economic pain without a wider paralysis throughout the company. It is meant to spur negotiations rather than paralyze the company.\"\n\nIf the tactic doesn't work to get a better offer, Shaiken said other more ‚Äústrategic‚Äù plants may be struck that could increase the pressure on the automakers by crippling facilities that make engines, transmissions and other vital components.\n\n\"A GM stamping plant ‚àíthe Chevrolet Metal Center in Flint ‚àí and a GM Delphi electronics plant in Flint went out on a 54-day strike in 1998 paralyzing virtually the entire corporation,\" Shaiken said.\n\nThat could lead to a lockout at other facilities that aren't struck but may not be able to operate with certain components, raising the specter that workers at those plants would suffer financial losses.\n\nAlternatively, the union could revert to shutting all plants at a single automaker, Shaiken said.\n\n\"What puts us in uncharted waters is a number of sharply different paths open to the union to press its demands. We also have to be aware, however, that the UAW isn‚Äôt the only actor here,\" Shaiken said. \"The automakers could begin choosing strategic options as well.\"\n\nThe UAW's initial strike targets are noteworthy because they affect an assembly plant at each of the three companies, said Marick Masters, a labor expert and business professor at Wayne State University.\n\n\"This action is significant enough to convey the union's resolve in escalating pressure to get a better deal than has been put on the table so far,\" Masters said. \"By not striking critical components plants the UAW avoids painting the companies into the corner.\"\n\nFord's bargaining late into the night\n\nShortly after Fain's 10 p.m. address, Ford put out an update to its final day of bargaining with the union.\n\n\"At 8 p.m. this evening at Solidarity House in Detroit, the United Auto Workers presented its first substantive counterproposal to Ford a few hours from the expiration of the current four-year collective bargain agreement,\" Ford's statement read. \"On the key economic issues that matter most to our UAW-represented employees, Ford has submitted four proposals to the UAW since Aug. 29.\"\n\nFord said its last offer was \"historically generous,\" with \"large\" wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments, more paid time off, additional retirement contributions, and more.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the UAW‚Äôs counterproposal tonight showed little movement from the union‚Äôs initial demands submitted Aug. 3,\" Ford's statement read. \"If implemented, the proposal would more than double Ford‚Äôs current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota, and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.\"\n\nFord said union negotiators made clear that unless it agreed to the UAW's \"unsustainable terms,\" it would strike at 11:59 p.m.\n\n\"Ford has bargained in good faith in an effort to avoid a strike, which could have wide-ranging consequences for our business and the economy,\" Ford said. \"It also impacts the very 57,000 UAW-Ford workers we are trying to reward with this contract. Our hourly employees would take home nearly 60% less on average with UAW strike pay than they would from working. And without vehicles in production, the profit-sharing checks that UAW workers could expect to receive early next year will also be decimated by a significant strike.\n\n\"Ford remains absolutely committed to reaching an agreement that rewards our employees and protects Ford‚Äôs ability to invest in the future as we move through industry-wide transformation.\"\n\nUAW strike photos:'We will strike all three of the Big Three at once': UAW to strike GM, Ford and Stellantis\n\nGM's last-minute offer\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra said late Thursday afternoon that the automaker made a historic offer earlier to the UAW that pushes the hourly wage increase up to 20% over the life of the contract compared with 18%, which is what Fain said the company had offered a day earlier.\n\n\"We‚Äôve worked days, nights and weekends since receiving the UAW‚Äôs demands. We have been bargaining in good faith to deliver a better package with historic wage increases and manufacturing commitments, recognizing your contributions to our company ‚Äî past, present, and future,\" Barra said in a statement. \"We are working with urgency and have proposed yet another increasingly strong offer with the goal of reaching an agreement tonight. Remember: we had a strike in 2019 and nobody won.\"\n\nFain revealed the list of \"members\" demands on Aug. 1 and they include:\n\nEliminating wage tiers\n\nA 40% wage increase over the life of the contract. The 40% signifies the increase to CEO salaries.\n\nRestoring the cost-of-living allowance adjustments to counteract inflation\n\nDefined benefit pension for all workers\n\nThe right to strike over plant closures\n\nA reduced work week and more paid time off\n\nLimiting the use of temporary workers\n\nIncreased benefits to current retirees\n\nWhat is needed for a settlement\n\nTo get a tentative agreement that can be ratified by the membership, the UAW wants an offer that goes further on such critical issues as wages, workers reaching a top wage sooner, and the use of temps, Masters said.\n\n\"Something north of a 30% increase in general wages, a more expedited progression to the top tier (less than three years), and restrictions on the usage of temps will be necessary steps toward a settlement,\" Masters said. \"Obviously, the more pay that can be put into the electronic accounts of the workers the better, and there are ways of doing so without further increasing base wages.\"\n\nEarly on in Facebook Live appearances to members, Fain shared the offers the Detroit carmakers proposed and he indicated they belonged in the trash because they fell short of meeting any of the union's demands. At the end of last month, he filed unfair labor practice charges against GM and Stellantis saying they were bargaining in bad faith because they had not yet made a serious offer to address the demands.\n\nFain has emphasized that the automakers collectively have made $21 billion in the first half of the year and billions more in recent years without giving hourly workers their \"fair share\" after they gave big wage concessions back in 2009 when GM and Stellantis, then called Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, were going through bankruptcy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/railroad-union-votes-no-strike-threat/index.html", "title": "A third railroad union rejects proposed contract, further raising the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nA third railroad union has rejected a tentative labor deal, a move that further raises the odds that America‚Äôs 110,000 freight railroad workers will go on strike early next month.\n\nThe rank and file members of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers voted against a tentative agreement reached in September, according to the union and the railroads. The precise margin of the opposition to the proposed deal was not immediately available.\n\nThe union represents about 300 workers who repair and rebuild diesel locomotives and railroad tracks. It is the smallest of 13 unions that represent more than 100,000 union members at the nation‚Äôs major freight railroads. But if any of those unions do strike the railroads, its picket lines would honored by the other unions, which would shutdown a still vital link in the nation‚Äôs supply chain.\n\nThe National Carriers‚Äô Conference Committee, which represents management in the negotiations, said it was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù by the vote, but that since a cooling off period remains in place, ‚Äúthe failed ratification does not present the risk of any strike or job action taken by IBB and the potential for any resulting service disruptions‚Äù until at least December 9.\n\nThe union‚Äôs brief statement on the vote said it ‚Äúfully expects to continue negotiating further toward a satisfactory contract‚Äù with railroad management. But the vote is a sign of the threat that the nation‚Äôs railroads could grind to a halt in a matter of weeks, due to the difficulty in reaching a deal that will be acceptable to both front-line workers and the railroads.\n\nIn October members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes District (BMWED), which represents about 23,000 track maintenance workers, voted to reject a similar tentative deal. So did the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, who maintain the signal system needed to run the railroads. The two unions are set to go on strike as soon as December 4.\n\nThe no votes are stark evidence of the widespread anger towards railroad management among workers and raise the bar on crafting agreements they might ratify. The vote has been close at some of the unions that have ratified the tentative deals negotiated by their leadership.\n\nThe two largest rail unions, representing the engineers and conductors who make up the two-person train crews, are holding their own ratification votes, the results of which will be known on November 21.\n\nEach union rejecting ratification raises the odds that one of them could go on strike, which would be enough to shut down the four major US freight railroads. Unless new deals can be reached that can win ratification votes, the only way to prevent a strike would be through Congressional action that orders workers to stay on the job.\n\nA freight railroad strike would create massive problems for the US economy, snarling still-struggling supply chains and triggering widespread bottlenecks and shortages.\n\nAbout 30% of US freight, when measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail. Any prolonged strike could send prices for goods from gasoline to food to cars soaring. In addition, factories could be forced to shut temporarily due to parts shortages. Products that consumers want to buy could be missing from store shelves.\n\nLabor relations at railroads are subject to a different labor law than the one that governs workers at most US businesses. Railroad unions face limits on when they can strike and are prohibited from taking action during the ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù periods that follow a no-vote by membership.\n\nThe deals being voted down are lucrative for union members. They include an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating to 2020, as well as pay raises totaling 24% during the four-year life of the contracts, which run through 2024. Union members also would receive cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nAll told, the backpay and bonuses will give union members an average payment of $11,000 per worker once the deal is ratified.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not the pay that has been the sticking point in the negotiations, it‚Äôs the work rules and quality of life issues, such as staffing levels and paid sick time, which the tentative agreements do not include. So far railroad management has rejected proposals from union negotiators to add sick pay as a way to win ratification from the rank and file.\n\nWill Congress act to avert a strike?\n\nCongress can also prevent or end a strike by extending a cooling-off period during which the unions cannot strike, or by imposing a contract on union members.\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh, who was involved in a marathon 20-hour bargaining session between rail management and three of the unions in September to avert a strike, said last month he remains hopeful that the unions and management will be able to reach new agreements acceptable to rank and file members.\n\nWithout such progress, though, Congress will have to act to prevent a strike, he said.\n\nIf ‚Äúfor some reason [one of the unions] doesn‚Äôt get to an agreement with the companies then ‚Ä¶ Congress will have to take action to avert a strike in our country,‚Äù Walsh said in an interview with CNN.\n\nThe unions are clear that they don‚Äôt want Congressional action to impose a contract that keeps them on the job. They believe the threat of a strike is the best way to get a new deal their members can accept, particularly one which provides paid sick time missing from the current labor deals.\n\n‚ÄúCongress should not have to intervene. The railroads should provide paid sick leave to its employees,‚Äù the BMWED said in a statement in response to Walsh‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúThey have the money to do it, and it literally would cost them a penny of every dollar of record profits to provide it. It‚Äôs only 2% of what CSX, NS and UP spent so far this year in stock buybacks. It‚Äôs literally nothing to them, yet they refuse to provide it.‚Äù\n\nEven before the September strike deadline, many business groups were urging Congress to act. But Democratic leadership expressed reluctance to order the unions to stay on the job.\n\nControl of the House of Representatives in the new Congress is still unknown as vote counting continues in the wake of last week‚Äôs midterm elections. But Democrats will still have control of the House and Senate during the so-called lame duck session through the end of the year. It would still required a certain level of bipartisanship to get legislation through both houses of a closely divided Congress to end or prevent a strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/business/rail-strike-threat-recedes/index.html", "title": "Rail unions decry Biden's call for Congress to block strike ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nPresident Joe Biden was in the unusual position Tuesday of being praised by business interests and attacked by his normal allies in the labor movement after calling for Congress to move immediately to block a strike by more than 100,000 union members at the nation‚Äôs freight railroads set for the end of next week.\n\nThe move was a serious setback for the unions, who say they needed the right to strike in order to get railroad management to negotiate over their major demand to give workers sick days that are not in the current contracts. They say the railroads, many of which reported record profits last year, are enjoying even stronger profits this year and can afford to meet the union‚Äôs demands.\n\nBiden said he is sympathetic to the union‚Äôs demand, but he said a rail strike would cause too much economic damage and must be avoided.\n\n‚ÄúI share workers‚Äô concern about the inability to take leave to recover from illness or care for a sick family member,‚Äù he said in his statement. ‚ÄúNo one should have to choose between their job and their health ‚Äì or the health of their children.‚Äù\n\nHe said that the tentative deals that were rejected by rank-and-file members of the unions were good deals for the workers, even in the face of those concerns. They include 24% wage increases over the four-year life of the deals, the biggest pay increases won by the unions in more than 50 years. Biden pointed out that union leadership had agreed to the tentative deals in September when they were negotiated and called them good deals for the rank-and-file members.\n\nUnion anger at deals, and at Biden\n\nBut the membership of four of the unions rejected the tentative deals. The other eight unions are prepared to honor their picket lines and go on strike as well without a deal or Congressional action, and Biden‚Äôs voiced sympathy for the demands about sick time didn‚Äôt satisfy some of the union leaders Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúIt is not enough to ‚Äòshare workers‚Äô concerns,‚Äô‚Äù said a statement from the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division, which represents about 23,000 track maintenance workers, making it the third largest rail union. ‚ÄúA call to Congress to act immediately to pass legislation that adopts tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave ignores the railroad workers‚Äô concerns.‚Äù\n\nOther union officials also were critical of Biden‚Äôs move to impose the unpopular contracts. Asked by CNN if he felt Biden had let down unions and their members, Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, replied, ‚ÄúYes, to some extent.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to address the issue here of sick time. It‚Äôs very important,‚Äù Baldwin told CNN Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to‚Ä¶do the right thing.‚Äù\n\nBaldwin said the unions do not want to go on strike, but it‚Äôs the only way to win deals at the negotiating table that would have the support of rank-and-file members.\n\nHe said if there is a strike it would be the fault of railroad management, not the unions.\n\n‚ÄúThe railroads have the ability to fix this problem If they would come to the table and do that, we could move forward without Congressional action,‚Äù he said.\n\nHe said this is an issue that the rail unions have been seeking to address for decades, but it has received more attention from membership recently.\n\n‚ÄúThis became a glaring issue during the pandemic when we had members who were forced by their employers, the railroads, to stay home and quarantine without pay,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut really it comes down to simple things like the flu for a day or two, or a sick child, and the ability to take a day or two paid.‚Äù\n\nWhile the leadership of the unions were unhappy with Biden, some of the rank-and-file members were far more angry.\n\n‚ÄúJoe Biden blew it. He had the opportunity to prove his labor-friendly pedigree to millions of workers by simply asking Congress for legislation to end the threat of a national strike on terms more favorable to workers,‚Äù said Hugh Sawyer, treasurer of the Railroad Workers United, a caucus of union activists that had been campaigned against ratification of the tentative labor deals. ‚ÄúSadly, he could not bring himself to advocate for a lousy handful of sick days. The Democrats and Republicans are both pawns of big business and the corporations.‚Äù\n\nAny legislation to stop workers from going on strike needed to be passed with bipartisan support, though, so it‚Äôs not clear that an effort to impose a more labor-friendly contract would have been able to get the Republican votes it would need to pass the Senate.\n\nBusiness groups relieved\n\nWhile union leaders were attacking Biden, business groups were praising his call for Congressional action, saying a strike would be a serious blow to the economy by bringing 30% of the nation‚Äôs freight movements grinding to a halt.\n\nA strike, set for December 9, would snarled still-struggling supply chains and caused shortages and a spike in prices gasoline, food, automobiles and other goods, causing a body blow for the economy that many fear is already at risk of tipping into a recession. A week-long strike could cost the economy $1 billion, according to an estimate from Anderson Economic Group. The White House estimated that as many as 765,000 workers could temporarily be out of work within two weeks if the rail workers went on strike.\n\nMore than 400 business groups had joined Monday to plead with Congressional leaders on Monday for quick action. Several echoed those concerns Tuesday at a press conference organized by the Association of American Railroads, the industry‚Äôs trade group. They all praised Biden‚Äôs action, calling it appropriate.\n\n‚ÄúTruly the only thing standing in the way of insuring the American economy doesn‚Äôt take a major hit is the United States Congress,‚Äù said Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group for the oil industry that depends on rail shipments, who has clashed with Biden over high gasoline prices over the course of the last year.\n\nBiden and Democrats had been unwilling to block a strike in September when negotiations were nearing a previous strike deadline. As another strike deadline approaches, they felt there was no choice but to act.\n\nRailroads poised to get what they want\n\nBiden‚Äôs statement Monday night suggested that railroad strategy had worked.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management. They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and have recommended that we seek Congressional action,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúAs a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut in this case ‚Äì where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families ‚Äì I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.‚Äù\n\nThe fact that Congress will move to impose the rejected tentative deals could be considered a limited victory for the unions: Congress could have instead voted to impose contracts that were worse off for the workers than the ones their members rejected.\n\nRepublicans in Congress who had introduced legislation before a September strike deadline to keep workers on the job were looking to impose a contract that would have been worse for union members, one based on recommendations of a panel that had been named this summer to try to reach a deal acceptable to both sides. The unions had been able to negotiate improvements in that proposal at the negotiating table in September.\n\nThe unions meanwhile are calling for Congress to include sick days in any contract imposed on the unions. They say that will be better for both workers and rail customers who have regularly complained over poor service that even the railroads admit is inadequate.\n\n‚ÄúPassing legislation to adopt tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave for railroad workers will not address rail service issues,‚Äù said the BMWED‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúRather, it will worsen supply chain issues and further sicken, infuriate, and disenfranchise railroad workers as they continue shouldering the burdens of the railroads‚Äô mismanagement.‚Äù\n\nBut Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the only legislation that can get through a narrowly divided Congress in time to avert a strike is one that mirrors the rejected tentative agreements.\n\n‚ÄúSome in Congress want to modify the deal to either improve it for labor or for management,‚Äù said Biden‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúHowever well-intentioned, any changes would risk delay and a debilitating shutdown. The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.‚Äù", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/09/24/hollywood-screenwriters-studios-reach-agreement-to-end-strike/70916099007/", "title": "Writers strike ends: Hollywood screenwriters, studios reach agreement", "text": "Hollywood screenwriters and studios have reached a tentative agreement to end the writers strike that has brought the TV and movie industry to a standstill for nearly five months.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America announced the deal late Sunday with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group that represents studios, streaming services and producers in negotiations.\n\n\"The WGA and AMPTP have reached a tentative agreement,\" the Writers Guild West posted Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. \"This was made possible by the enduring solidarity of WGA members and extraordinary support of our union siblings who stood with us for over 146 days.\"\n\nThe three-year contract agreement must be approved by the guild's board and members before the strike officially ends.

Five have left their posts in recent weeks, he said.\n\nAnd Adams, who has defended the integrity of the 2020 election, said he reported to the FBI last week a new threat to hang him for ‚Äútreason.‚Äù\n\nIn Texas, meanwhile, officials have seen a 30% turnover rate among local election officials since 2020, said Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state‚Äôs office. In one small Texas county, all three election workers recently resigned. The election administrator cited threats as one reason for her resignation.\n\n‚ÄúOur election workers and elections have proved themselves incredibly resilient,‚Äù said Larry Norden, the senior director of the elections and government program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University‚Äôs law school. ‚ÄúBut we are really pushing it to the limit.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòSteep learning curve‚Äô\n\nNorden said the high turnover will lead to a ‚Äústeep learning curve‚Äù for a new crop of election workers, and he warned that honest mistakes they make in November could be ‚Äúblown out of proportion to confirm conspiracy theories.‚Äù\n\nVoting rights groups have warned for months about the coming wave of resignations.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 local election workers included in a survey from earlier this year for the Brennan Center said they were likely to leave their jobs before the 2024 presidential election. About a third of that group cited false political attacks on the election system as the top reason their departure.\n\nSome in Congress are calling for more federal resources to help local officials combat the wave of disinformation and threats.\n\nA recent report by the staff for Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee concluded that ‚Äúcoordinated campaigns of election disinformation are disrupting the crucial work of local election officials,‚Äù overwhelming their limited resources and subjecting workers to violent threats.\n\nIt called for a ‚Äúfederal whole-of-government response to this growing crisis.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòSelf-fulfilling prophecy‚Äô\n\nIn Kentucky, Adams said the resignations have come as local election officials have been ‚Äúdeluged‚Äù by frivolous open records requests ‚Äì seeking information about the inner workings of electronic voting machines ‚Äì along with widespread demands for recounts of primary elections lost in May by wide margins.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beginning to potentially pose a threat to us running a good election in November,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúAnd then these people that are behind all this will say, ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt trust these government officials.

But in a resignation letter obtained through a public records request by the nonpartisan news organization Votebeat, Herrera cited ‚Äúdangerous misinformation,‚Äù low pay, ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù new election laws and threats against the elections staff as key reasons behind her departure.\n\n‚ÄúThe life commitment I have given to this job is not sustainable,‚Äù she wrote, adding that she was resigning for her ‚Äúhealth and well-being.‚Äù\n\nTaylor, of the Texas secretary of state‚Äôs office, said Thursday that training has begun for new staff in Gillespie County.\n\nEarly voting begins October 24 in Texas.", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/tech/twitter-files-yoel-roth/index.html", "title": "Former top Twitter official forced to leave home due to threats amid ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nTwitter‚Äôs former head of trust and safety has fled his home due to an escalation in threats resulting from Elon Musk‚Äôs campaign of criticism against him, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday.\n\nYoel Roth, who resigned from the social media company in November, has in recent weeks faced a storm of attacks and threats of violence following the release of the so-called ‚ÄúTwitter Files‚Äù ‚Äî internal Twitter communications that new owner Musk has released through journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss.\n\nRoth‚Äôs position involved him working on sensitive issues including the suspension of then-President Donald Trump‚Äôs account in 2021. On Monday, Weiss posted a series of screenshots purported to show internal Twitter documents where Roth and others discussed whether to ban Trump‚Äôs account, with some employees questioning if the former president‚Äôs tweets violated the platform‚Äôs policies.\n\nWhile Musk had initially been publicly supportive of Roth, that soon changed after he left the company.\n\nRoth has since been the subject of criticism and threats following the release of the Twitter Files. However, things took a dark turn over the weekend when Musk appeared to endorse a tweet that baselessly accused Roth of being sympathetic to pedophilia ‚Äî a common trope used by conspiracy theorists to attack people online.\n\nA person familiar with Roth‚Äôs situation told CNN threats made against the former Twitter employee escalated exponentially after Musk engaged in the pedophilia conspiracy theory.\n\nIt is not the first time Roth has found himself in the public eye.\n\nTweets posted by Roth in 2016 and 2017 that were critical of then-President Trump and his supporters were later surfaced and used to argue that Roth and Twitter were biased against the president.\n\nAmong Roth‚Äôs tweets was one he wrote on Election Day 2016 that read, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.‚Äù\n\nTwitter defended Roth at the time, saying, ‚ÄúNo one person at Twitter is responsible for our policies or enforcement actions, and it‚Äôs unfortunate to see individual employees targeted for company decisions.‚Äù\n\nWhen Roth was still working at Twitter in October, Musk was asked about Roth‚Äôs old tweets.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel.

While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued. Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her doctors said was caused by stress.\n\nTwo days after the twins were born in 2014, Huff says, the father took a swing at her. He was holding their newborn son. They were still in the hospital. Huff had just delivered by Cesarean section. \"He was so angry at me because my milk wouldn't come in,\" Huff, 39, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe boy was born with \"floppy baby syndrome,\" a muscular condition doctors said might be attributed to abuse during pregnancy. Both children struggle with health issues, including speech disorders, and have spent months in instructional therapy to learn how to follow directions.\n\nThe father denies sexually assaulting or abusing Huff. He was charged last year with assault and battery against her; his lawyer says he completed a pretrial program in September to avoid a conviction. In 2015, a grand jury in Savannah declined to indict him on sexual assault charges.\n\nNew research is giving scientists more insight into the far-reaching and long-lasting harms of domestic violence to the children who grow up around it ‚Äì including a startling finding: Witnessing abuse carries the same risk of harm to children's mental health and learning as being abused directly.\n\nBrain imaging in infants shows that exposure to domestic violence ‚Äì even as they are sleeping, or in utero ‚Äì can reduce parts of the brain, change its overall structure and affect the way its circuits work together.\n\nStudies show that when babies born to mothers who were subjected to violence during pregnancy become adults, they have three times as much inflammation in their bodies as those whose mothers weren't. Inflammation causes a much higher risk of poor health, and a far greater likelihood of depression.\n\nAnd research also shows that these children are as likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as soldiers returning from war.\n\nPsychologist Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, past president of the American Psychological Association's division of trauma psychology, said \"babies are like a blank slate.\"\n\n\"If a mother is beaten while pregnant, there is a chance the baby will be injured, delivered prematurely, and there is a stack of other things that can happen ‚Äì including physiological programming of the hyperactive stress system that leads to inflammation as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like when a soldier comes back from combat, hears a click and hits the ground.\"\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4.5 million and 15 million children are exposed to physical violence in the home. Verbal and emotional abuse in the home is more difficult to track.\n\nSocial workers, health care providers and academics have long tracked the effects of trauma suffered by children growing up in urban neighborhoods with frequent gunfire and other violence. But outside of medical journals, there has been little reporting on the effect of the more common domestic violence on the millions of children who grow up on the residential battlefields where it occurs.\n\nNeuroscientist Tanja Jovanovic directs the Grady Trauma Project, a research institute based at Emory University in Atlanta. The risk of PTSD from domestic violence is high, she says, because it's a \"betrayal by someone who is supposed to be to a protector.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Jovanovic said, domestic violence often eliminates the \"buffering effect of another positive adult,\" because the adult who is targeted can't provide comfort to the children who witness it.\n\nPsychologist Abigail Gewirtz says domestic violence can feel scarier than war. Gewirtz is the director of the Institute of Translational Research in Children's Mental Health at the University of Minnesota. It's \"one of the most terrifying forms of violence because it happens in a place which is supposed to be safe,\" she said. \"Children are totally powerless, especially very young children. They are totally dependent on their parents.‚Äù\n\nRead more:\n\nDomestic violence 'code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\n'Toxic stress' on children can harm their lifelong learning, mental and physical health\n\nExposure also reduces the potential of babies and toddlers to learn. Alissa Huth-Bocks, a child psychologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said the \"most damaging time\" is during pregnancy and the first three years of life, when development \"takes the biggest hit at the brain level.\"\n\nLong-lasting consequences\n\nNegative consequences continue well into adulthood. Among childhood adversities, Ronald Kessler says, those involving family violence inflict the worst long-term effects.\n\nKessler is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the principal investigator of the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey ‚Äì the first nationally representative survey of mental disorders in the United States. He is co-director of the World Health Organization‚Äôs World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\n\n\"One of the long-term effects of childhood adversity is that they create emotional scars that get reopened when people are exposed to traumas in adulthood ‚Äì leading to adult PTSD,\" Kessler said.\n\nFor people of color, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, the effects of trauma are often magnified, federally funded research shows, because they are more likely to suffer from systemic racism, discrimination and microaggressions.\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Child Trends reported last year that 6 percent of kids nationally ‚Äì about 4.5 million children ‚Äì had seen or heard parents or other adults slap, hit, kick or punch each other in the home. Four percent had been exposed to or victims of neighborhood violence.\n\nThe results were based on a survey of parents about their children. In five states ‚Äì Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, Hawaii and Tennessee ‚Äì at least 10 percent of children had been exposed to domestic violence at home.\n\nChild Trends says parents likely under-report violence in the home out of embarrassment or fear of stigma. The research doesn't include the psychological and emotional abuse, including gaslighting, that many women and some men told USA TODAY was far worse for them and their children to live with.\n\nThe findings, children's health advocates say, underscore a need for improved detection and prevention of domestic violence, and better treatment of abuse survivors and their children in the health care system, schools and the courts.\n\nGeorgia, Huff's home, is among the states where the law recognizes the effects of domestic violence on children. The state has created criminal charges for domestic violence that happens anywhere in a house where children are present, not just when it occurs in front of the child.\n\nIn other ways, specialists say, the law and courts have a long way to go in recognizing the impact on children's well-being. Parents accused or even convicted of domestic violence in many cases are able to gain unsupervised visits with their children, or partial or full partial custody ‚Äì even when children are afraid of the offender.\n\nWhen parents in an abusive relationship separate, conditions for their children can become even riskier. The nonprofit group Center for Judicial Excellence, which monitors family courts, found that more than 650 children were killed by a parent in a \"divorce, separation, custody, visitation, child support situation\" from 2008 through 2018.\n\nDomestic violence crosses racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Cheryl Branch, executive director at Savannah's SAFE women's shelter, says the calls she gets from abused women in The Landings, an exclusive gated community, are as horrific as those that come from low-income clients.\n\nShe says women are afraid to leave husbands who threaten to spend whatever it takes to gain full custody of the children. When shelter residents go back to their domestic abusers ‚Äì as many do ‚Äì Branch is required to notify child protection authorities, just as she would be if a parent returned to someone who has sexually abused his or her child.\n\nHuth-Bocks, the Cleveland psychologist, says researchers' ability to study human brain development has \"exploded in the last five to six years.\" So has data on the mental health and addiction effects of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs ‚Äì 10 harmful experiences or conditions, including domestic violence, tracked by health professionals.\n\nGenerations of violence\n\nIn San Diego, the children of now-divorced Eric and Yadira Sanchez ‚Äì Angel, Noel and their 15-year-old brother ‚Äì say they can vividly recall visiting their maternal grandparents' house when they were young.\n\nThey talk about seeing their grandmother punch cabinet doors and throw drinking glasses. She and their grandfather would hit each other in front of them, they say. The grandparents could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater, Angel and Noel say, they watched as their mother chased their father with a kitchen knife and smashed a piece of a wood across his back. In December 2011, police arrested Yadira Sanchez on charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and felony spousal battery, but prosecutors declined to pursue the charges.\n\nAs the alleged violence escalated, the children's grades and mental health declined, a review of school and medical records shows. (USA TODAY is not identifying the youngest son because he is a minor.)\n\n\"When these high levels of stress happen too often and too intensely, it creates a toxic pathway that alters how our brains and bodies operate and how we think, learn and behave,\" said psychologist Sheri Madigan, a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nYadira Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, acknowledges that the boys were exposed to domestic violence. But he claims Eric Sanchez's efforts to separate the boys from their mother likely hurt them far more.\n\n\"This is not a case where physical violence was the primary factor,\" Marcus said.\n\nChange to brain, body\n\nResearchers who followed 1,420 children in North Carolina from age 9 to 30 found that exposure to domestic violence in the home had the same serious and life-changing effects as experiencing the abuse directly.\n\nThe American Medical Association published the study in November. University of Vermont psychologist William Copeland was its lead author. These children \"have the same type of poor outcomes 10, 20 years down the road\" as children who \"experience it directly themselves,\" he said.\n\nA global study out last year of more than 125,000 people from all socioeconomic backgrounds found children who witnessed domestic violence had the same risk and incidence of PTSD as soldiers returning from war.\n\nResearch presented in November at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies shows that children exposed at an early age to trauma, including domestic violence, have a smaller hippocampus ‚Äì the brain area related to learning and memory formation ‚Äì a risk factor for PTSD.\n\nOther research shows that the amygdala ‚Äì the part of the brain that processes emotions, memory and fear ‚Äì in children who have been exposed to violence reacts more strongly to threats than in children who haven't.\n\nEamon McCrory, a professor of developmental neuroscience at University College London, says the changes make it more difficult for these children to get along with others. Other studies have shown that exposing children to violence leads to lower grades and a greater probability of dropping out of school.\n\nPsychologist and professor Katie McLaughlin directs the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard. \"This change in size and likely the function of the hippocampus could be one potential mechanism that's underlying those differences in school achievement,\" she said. The brain works to help protect from danger. But when children are dealing with adversity, their brains can be overwhelmed.\n\nLearning disordered\n\nCatholic high schools around San Diego began scouting Angel Sanchez when he was in middle school, according to Phillip Lomax, his coach at the time. The strapping middle linebacker ‚Äì he was 6-foot-tall and 225 pounds in high school ‚Äì was hard to miss.\n\nProblem was, Sanchez said, just as his athletic abilities began gaining notice, his home life deteriorated and his grades dropped.\n\nHis mother stayed out late at night, his father found other men's numbers on her phone, and a pattern of erratic and often violent behavior against the boys and their father developed, Eric Sanchez said in requests for restraining orders and police reports.\n\nThe three boys each had an Individual Education Program detailing how they best learn given their disabilities. Angel has a speech impairment that affects his oral and written communication, reading comprehension and math problem solving. Noel was granted accommodations to receive extra time for homework and tests. The youngest boy struggles with reading and writing. All the boys were given intensive tutoring, language therapy and case managers.\n\nAs tensions between the parents rose, Angel's grade point average dropped from 3.0 at the beginning of his sixth grade to 1.3 by the start of 7th grade, school transcripts show.\n\nThat was the year ‚Äì 2008 ‚Äì that their mother chased their father around a table with a steak knife and stabbed the padded kitchen stools, Eric Sanchez and the boys told child welfare workers.\n\nNoel Sanchez, now 18, recalls that period. \"Oh man, I can still see and hear what happened those nights. That‚Äôs not going to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nIn children exposed to domestic violence, the parts of the brain that detect threats and anticipate pain ‚Äì the anterior insula and amygdala ‚Äì are strongly affected by threatening faces during brain imaging.\n\nResearchers at University College London wrote in 2011 that the results might predict a later risk factor for anxiety disorders and increasing vulnerability to mental illness. A more recent study by the same authors showed this heightened responsiveness was present even when children weren't consciously aware of a threat.\n\n\"If you've grown up in a situation that's dangerous, you're much more likely to react to something that's actually totally safe (as if it were) a potential threat,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe two younger Sanchez boys went back and forth between their feuding parents. Angel stayed with his father. School progress reports show that Noel missed 57 classes in the first three months of 2017. His younger brother missed 137.\n\nIn 2016, Yadira Sanchez was granted a restraining order against Angel. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, says Angel kept trying to take his brothers away from their mother. Yadira lost custody of the boys in March 2017.\n\nLomax, the coach, says the chaos hurt Angel's future plans. \"If you‚Äôd asked me, when he was going into 9th grade, what Angel‚Äôs potential as a linebacker was, he was certainly a Division I contender, for sure,\" he said.\n\nEric Sanchez, the father, says one high school withdrew a scholarship offer after it saw Angel's grades. He missed practice often during high school during the parents' custody fight.\n\nNoel Sanchez says that the turmoil before their parents separated, and stays with their mother after the split, were so traumatic that he attempted suicide in 2014 and considered it at other times. \"I was just trying to hurt myself to let the pain go away,\" he said.\n\nMore:Surviving Suicide Q&A: Laura answers your questions on loss, depression, the hard stuff\n\nMore:After a suicide, here‚Äôs what happens to the people left behind\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nDebbie Ricker says domestic violence looms over three generations of her family. Both the California woman and her daughter Desiree say it led to Desiree's drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental and physical health struggles.\n\nRicker fought a 15-year custody battle with her ex-husband. It ended only when her son turned 18. She says the emotional abuse she suffered and her children witnessed still affects them. \"My ex was very open with his abuse toward me,\" she said. \"The abuse occurred in front of our kids, friends, family.\"\n\nDesiree, now 29, said \"I never heard him be nice to her. He belittled her every step of the way.\"\n\nMarc Loehren, Debbie Ricker's ex-husband and Desiree's father, denies their allegations. He was never charged with a crime against them. ‚ÄúMy two children had a wonderful childhood,\" he told USA TODAY. \"There was no violence in this household. ... if anything, the mom hit me with a car.‚Äù\n\nHe acknowledges the children have been to multiple psychologists. But he cites Ricker's family background and marriages before and after their relationship. He alleges that Ricker tried to undermine his relationship with the children.\n\n\"The children are fairly disturbed from anything that the mom has told them ‚Äì which is alienation,\" Loehren said.\n\nDuring an interview for a family evaluation during the custody fight, Loehren said Ricker was scaring the children by calling the police when he allegedly violated restraining orders.\n\nBased on the evaluator's recommendation, a family court judge ordered the parents into joint counseling. The judge said each had to educate themselves on \"child development and high parental conflict.\"\n\nRicker, 62, says she asked for a divorce. She says Loehren suggested the two of them sit down and explain it to the children. She says he opened he conversation by saying \"Mommy doesn't like daddy anymore, so she is breaking our family apart.\" The kids started screaming and crying, Ricker says. Then they started to hit her.\n\nDesiree started to gain weight when she was about 5. A therapist would later attribute the weight gain to the family dysfunction. When Desiree was 12, the family doctor told Ricker that her daughter had pre-diabetes. \"It just made me cry,\" Ricker says.\n\nIn high school, Desiree says, she gained about 100 pounds ‚Äì weight she still carries. At 12, Desiree says, she began an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who also came from a violent home. It lasted, on and off, until she was 27. The ex-boyfriend was never charged with abusing her.\n\nStudies show that childhood adversities can lead to obesity later in life. Duke University researchers reported last year that children aged 12 to 15 were far more likely to eat poorly and less likely to get physical activity after exposure to domestic violence.\n\n'These things go together'\n\nIt's common for children who are exposed to domestic violence to also suffer other adverse childhood experiences. ACEs are linked to a range of mental and physical health consequences throughout life, up to and including early death.\n\n‚ÄúIf there's domestic violence in the household, it's statistically likely that there's also physical abuse and emotional abuse and maybe drug abuse or alcohol abuse,\" said Canan Karatekin, a professor of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. \"These things go together.‚Äù\n\nHuff took on the role of protector of her younger siblings. It carried its own burden.\n\nDuring the summer before fifth grade, she says, she remembers holding one of her sisters in her lap as another was rushed to the hospital after the first of several suicide attempts. \"I had to grow up fast and be a second mom to my siblings,\" she says. \"It made me stronger. ... I was determined not to be like my sister or my mother.\"\n\nBut that was nearly impossible.\n\nHuff and her mother say domestic violence spans generations in their family.\n\nDenise Boyd was caring for a year-old daughter while she was pregnant with Huff at 21. Boyd was having a breakdown, she says, after years living with the abusive father of her children.\n\nThe father could not be reached for comment. He was never charged with a crime against Boyd.\n\nBoyd's mother went to take her home to Georgia. Once in her parents' home, Boyd says, she rarely went out. On rare occasions when she did, she would hide on the floor of the family car. \"I felt like I wasn‚Äôt the same anymore,\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nHuff was born in August 1979. As a little girl, she developed a speech disorder. In eighth grade, Huff says, she was so anxious she tried to run away. She was sent briefly to a juvenile detention facility.\n\nDavid Murphey, director of the Child Trends DataBank, describes domestic violence as a type of toxic stress linked to health problems later in life. Domestic violence rewires the brain, he said, harming executive function ‚Äì \"the ability to weigh options and make well-considered choices.\"\n\nHow can communities best address abuse?\n\nDetecting, treating and preventing exposure to domestic abuse are the keys to reducing it, specialists say.\n\nCertified nurse midwife Pamela Glenn, field education supervisor at Minneapolis's Walden University School of Nursing, has screened her patients for abuse for 30 years.\n\nShe says health care professionals should create a safe space for patients, don't judge or blame, and avoid using the word \"abuse.\"\n\n‚ÄúMost people, when they hear the word 'abuse,' they automatically think physical violence,\" Glenn said. \"The abuse may be emotional abuse only ‚Äì but that can be extremely damaging to people's health.‚Äù\n\nShe asks questions such as ‚ÄúDoes your partner support you?\" And \"Do you ever find that your partner is constantly checking up on you when you're not together and almost interrogating you at times?\" If she suspects abuse, she says, she offers resources such as information for an advocate or safe place.\n\nSpecialists say screening alone is not enough. \"Screening is the great first step, but it's only a first step,\" said Jess Bartlett, a trauma researcher with Child Trends. \"Too often we look at what kids have experienced, but not how they function.\" She says health care providers should look at children's needs, and whether the community has the resources to respond.\n\nMurphey agrees. ‚ÄúUnless there are adequate networks of services and referral practices to follow the results up,\" he said, \"what you're doing is you're really setting up an unfortunate situation where you know you've got lots of problems but you don't have services in place yet to respond to them.‚Äù\n\nWith treatment, researchers wrote in a report for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, children exposed to early trauma including domestic violence can overcome the experiences without developing stress-related disorders.\n\nOften the support of parents, friends, family and school can help alleviate the effects of stress and trauma in children, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n\n\"A strong relationship with a caring, nonviolent parent is one of the most important factors in helping children grow in a positive way despite their experiences,\" the group wrote in a 2014 report.\n\nBut Huth-Bocks said the parents she works with are often \"preoccupied keeping everyone alive and can't always be the most sensitive parent.\n\n\"There‚Äôs bigger fish to fry.\"\n\n'Pure chaos'\n\nHuff says it was a violent world that her twins entered in July 2014.\n\nShe says the father was holding the boy two days after their birth when he took a swing at her. The girl was the crib behind Huff, she says. She says she had to hold onto the crib to keep it from falling.\n\nThe father, Ignacio Ramirez Vallejo, denies her account. \"It never happened,\" he told USA TODAY. He was not charged in the alleged incident. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in court many times,\" he said. \"Latrelle tried to accuse me for many different things. We were together almost seven years. They never find me guilty.‚Äù\n\nRamirez Vallejo says he did not sexually assault Huff.\n\nHis lawyer, A.J. Balbo, gave USA TODAY copies of letters he says Huff wrote to Ramirez Vallejo two years before the twins' birth saying she wanted to have children with him. ‚ÄúEverything they say about me is not true,\" Ignacio Ramirez said. \"I‚Äôm a Christian.‚Äù\n\nJeanne Fell, a nurse practitioner who specializes in neurology and has treated Huff's twins, says the pregnancy was about as complicated as they come. Huff had severe vomiting during much of the pregnancy and required intravenous medication. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks. A typical pregnancy lasts 40.\n\n\"It's been pure chaos since these kids have been born,\" Fell said. \"She does her very best, but certainly there are limits to how much she can give of herself to the children.\"\n\nBoth babies were poor eaters, Fell says. The boy had hyptonia, or floppy baby syndrome, which can be caused by nerve or brain damage. He's now on a powerful antipsychotic drug to help with aggression or and self injury, a review of his medical records show. Fell said he's \"done really well and is much more calm,\" but if he goes off the drug, she said, he hits others and tries to escape.\n\nHuff has been getting reports from her daughter's school, including one reviewed by USA TODAY from October in which she was described as \"extra tearful today\" and accused of \"mooning\" several other children.\n\nNeither child sleeps more than five hours a night, Huff says. Before he started on his current medication, Huff's son rarely slept more than three hours.\n\nHuff has a master's degree in mental health counseling and is pursuing a second master's in social work. She recently lost her job as an armed security guard after missing work to attend to her children's health appointments She's now looking for a job in mental health case work.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant, Ramirez-Vallejo was apprehended in Savannah not long after President Donald Trump took office, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said. His case is pending in immigration court. He has argued he should be allowed to stay in this country because he has children here. He sees the children every other weekend for two full days, but is not allowed to spend the night with them.\n\nHuff says she tries to focus on the future.\n\n\"My dream is for my children to not grow up in a dysfunctional family, as I did and as their father did,\" she said. \"I want both children to feel safe and to be able to grow in an environment where they will be successful, stable and happy.\n\n\"The new generation needs an opportunity to live life without continuing the cycle.\"\n\nIf you or your child is experiencing domestic violence and/or mental health problems:\n\nContact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or online\n\nContact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255\n\nVisit the National Child Traumatic Stress Network to learn about resources and treatment.\n\nReporting for this article was supported by the Fund for Journalism on Child Well-Being, a program of the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism.\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with issues mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY‚Äôs \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html", "title": "90% of US adults say mental health is a crisis in the United States ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nAn overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNine out of 10 adults said ‚Äãthey believed that there‚Äôs a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer ‚Äì 2¬Ω years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n‚ÄúThe Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,‚Äù said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor,‚Äù including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,‚Äù said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention‚Äôs executive committee.\n\n‚ÄúPeople are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that‚Äôs progress.‚Äù\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it ‚Äì some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority ‚Äì more than 4 out of 5 ‚Äì of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n‚ÄúNot everyone‚Äôs a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,‚Äù said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. ‚ÄúIf we only rely on the mental health force, we‚Äôre going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.‚Äù\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country‚Äôs mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,‚Äù he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it‚Äôs a big problem that there aren‚Äôt enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don‚Äôt know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard ‚Äúnothing at all‚Äù about the new 988 hotline.\n\n‚ÄúThis can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,‚Äù Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

It also alleges that some of the company‚Äôs senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter‚Äôs serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter ‚ÄúMudge‚Äù Zatko, who was previously the company‚Äôs head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter‚Äôs leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users‚Äô data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don‚Äôt have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk‚Äôs attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk‚Äôs claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)‚Äôs board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko‚Äôs lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk‚Äôs involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, ‚ÄúWe have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.‚Äù\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n‚ÄúMr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,‚Äù the Twitter spokesperson said. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko‚Äôs allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.‚Äù\n\nSome of Zatko‚Äôs most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company‚Äôs former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter‚Äôs security problems to the company‚Äôs board of directors. The company‚Äôs executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company‚Äôs security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko‚Äôs back to have a third-party consulting firm‚Äôs report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company‚Äôs problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter ‚Äì so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko‚Äôs tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter‚Äôs FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company‚Äôs security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits ‚Äì was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate ‚Äúand take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.‚Äù\n\nThe claims I‚Äôve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel‚Äôs top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n‚ÄúTake a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for disaster,‚Äù Grassley said. ‚ÄúThe claims I‚Äôve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.‚Äù\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal ‚Äî who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection ‚Äî highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n‚ÄúIf the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,‚Äù Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. ‚ÄúOriginal, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action‚Äù by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC ‚Äúto help the agency enforce the laws,‚Äù and to gain federal whistleblower protections. ‚ÄúThe prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge‚Äôs decision, and in fact he didn‚Äôt even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.‚Äù\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n‚ÄúAll my life, I‚Äôve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I‚Äôve done that through the security field. That‚Äôs my main lever,‚Äù he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world‚Äôs most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known ‚Äúethical hacker‚Äù turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he‚Äôd been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company‚Äôs employees ‚Äî amounting to roughly half the company‚Äôs workforce ‚Äî access to some of the platform‚Äôs critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as ‚Äúegregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.‚Äù\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company‚Äôs platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the ‚Äúproduction environment.‚Äù\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned ‚Äúit was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did‚Ä¶. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.‚Äù Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees‚Äô individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter‚Äôs flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company‚Äôs 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko‚Äôs disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter‚Äôs engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter‚Äôs employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter‚Äôs live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko‚Äôs tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko‚Äôs statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter‚Äôs existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter‚Äôs security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users‚Äô private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter‚Äôs central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining ‚Äúa comprehensive information security program.‚Äù\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company‚Äôs claims to the contrary, it had ‚Äúnever been in compliance‚Äù with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an ‚Äúanomalously high rate of security incidents,‚Äù approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. ‚ÄúBased on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,‚Äù Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter‚Äôs board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko‚Äôs disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it‚Äôs found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter‚Äôs original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC‚Äôs $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there‚Äôs a violation here ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a big if ‚Äî then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n‚ÄúOne of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should‚Äôve been named,‚Äù Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. ‚ÄúAnd if there‚Äôs a violation here ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a big if ‚Äî then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.‚Äù\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko‚Äôs allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter‚Äôs existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter‚Äôs FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company‚Äôs level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko‚Äôs firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government‚Äôs intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal ‚Äî then Twitter‚Äôs chief technology officer ‚Äî proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal‚Äôs suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal‚Äôs suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n‚ÄúThe fact that Twitter‚Äôs current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter‚Äôs effects on U.S. national security,‚Äù Zatko‚Äôs disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter‚Äôs current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter‚Äôs effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko‚Äôs report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens‚Äô data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko‚Äôs disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company‚Äôs long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers‚Äô remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter‚Äôs figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter ‚Äì leaving all accounts that for some reason can‚Äôt, for instance because they‚Äôre known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko‚Äôs disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko‚Äôs disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter‚Äôs head of site integrity that the company didn‚Äôt know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company ‚Äúhad no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,‚Äù in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company‚Äôs value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I‚Äôm still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify ‚Äúbots‚Äù because there isn‚Äôt a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn‚Äôt know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. ‚ÄúThe executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform ‚Ä¶ At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what‚Äôs actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,‚Äù he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms‚Äô rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter‚Äôs ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko‚Äôs allegations could provide ammunition to Musk‚Äôs central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. ‚ÄúJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

The 78-page report stated Uber dealt with 3,824 incidents of severe sexual assault and misconduct in the U.S., including that 20 people were killed in assaults.\n\nThe company reported 141 incidents of rape and 998 incidents of sexual assault in 2020, according to NBC News.\n\nAdditionally, the report states about one in 90 million trips resulted in passengers dying in fatal car crashes. With a rate of 0.62 Uber-related motor vehicle fatalities per 100 million Uber-related vehicle miles traveled, Uber had about one-half the death rate of the entire U.S., which was 1.22 motor vehicle fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, according to the report. This means using Uber to get from point A to point B could be relatively safer than driving yourself, with regard to motor vehicle deaths.\n\nRideshare etiquette:Do you tip Uber and Lyft drivers?

The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network reports that 90 percent of adult rape victims are female, as well as 82 percent of juvenile rape victims.\n\nAccording to an Alarms.org women‚Äôs safety report in 2020, Uber and Lyft are safer for women than taxis, professional car services and public transportation. Still, that doesn‚Äôt mean rideshare transportation always happens without incident.\n\nEven though Uber requires background checks and vets its drivers each year, plenty of people feel unsafe in an Uber.

Do not distract the driver. Watch for traffic before opening the door. Request your ride while indoors. Use Uber‚Äôs trip-sharing features. Don‚Äôt share your personal information with your Uber driver. Confirm the driver‚Äôs identity before you get in the car. If alone, sit in the passenger rear seat. Make sure the driver is in the same make, model and color vehicle displayed in the app, with a license plate that matches. Prompt the driver to confirm your name and destination before you reveal this information. Follow Uber‚Äôs rules and local laws. Inform your driver that you are tracking your trip. Use additional personal safety apps on your phone or smart device. Ride with a friend when possible.\n\nFor drivers worried about safety, The Rideshare Guy blog says Uber and Lyft drivers can install a two-way dashboard camera and a privacy partition, as well as lock their doors, take self-defense classes and trust their gut by canceling rides or delivery requests that seem unsafe.\n\nHow to be safe from the coronavirus in an Uber\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about the rideshare industry.

Immediately after Ryan shared an intimate photo of his own, the cybercriminal demanded $5,000, threatening to make the photo public and send it to Ryan‚Äôs family and friends.\n\nRyan Last.

But after paying the scammers from his college savings, Stuart said, ‚ÄúThey kept demanding more and more and putting lots of continued pressure on him.‚Äù\n\nAt the time, Stuart knew none of what her son was experiencing. She learned the details after law enforcement investigators reconstructed the events leading up to his death.\n\nShe had said goodnight to Ryan at 10 p.m., and described him as her usually happy son. By 2 a.m., he had been scammed, and taken his life.

The FBI says the use of child pornography by criminals to lure suspects also constitutes a serious crime.\n\nThe investigation into Last‚Äôs case is ongoing, Stuart and the FBI tell CNN.\n\n‚ÄúTo be a criminal that specifically targets children ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the more deeper violations of trust I think in society,‚Äù says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dan Costin, who leads a team of investigators working to counter crimes against children.\n\nAccording to Costin, many of the sextortion scams reported to the FBI are determined to be from criminals on the African continent and in Southeast Asia. Federal investigators are working with their law enforcement counterparts around the world, Costin said, to help identify and arrest perpetrators who are targeting kids online.\n\nRyan Last and his mother, Pauline Stuart. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nOne challenge for the FBI: many victims of sextortion do not report the incidents to law enforcement.\n\n‚ÄúThe embarrassment piece of this is probably one of the bigger hurdles that the victims have to overcome,‚Äù said Costin. ‚ÄúIt can be a lot, especially in that moment.‚Äù\n\nBut investigators urge victims to quickly contact law enforcement, either online or at their local FBI field office.\n\nMedical experts say there‚Äôs a key reason why young males are especially vulnerable to sextortion-related scams.\n\n‚ÄúTeen brains are still developing,‚Äù said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General in Boston. ‚ÄúSo when something catastrophic happens, like a personal picture is released to people online, it‚Äôs hard for them to look past that moment and understand that in the big scheme of things they‚Äôll be able to get through this.‚Äù\n\nHadland said there are steps parents can take to help safeguard their kids from online harm.\n\n‚ÄúThe most important thing that a parent should do with their teen is try to understand what they‚Äôre doing online,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou want to know when they‚Äôre going online, who they‚Äôre interacting with, what platforms they‚Äôre using. Are they being approached by people that they don‚Äôt know, are they experiencing pressure to share information or photos?‚Äù\n\nHadland said it‚Äôs also critical that parents specifically warn teens of scams like sextortion, without shaming them.\n\n‚ÄúYou want to make it clear that they can talk to you if they have done something, or they feel like they‚Äôve made a mistake,‚Äù he said.\n\nRyan‚Äôs mom agrees.\n\n‚ÄúYou need to talk to your kids because we need to make them aware of it,‚Äù Stuart said.\n\nStill grieving the loss of her son, she is channeling her family‚Äôs pain into action, and honoring Ryan by speaking out and telling his story.

But Musk charged ahead anyway through sheer force of will, leading to a wave of new impostor accounts posing as major brands, athletes and other verified users that soon forced Twitter to suspend the feature.\n\n‚ÄúIt went off the rails in exactly the ways that we anticipated,‚Äù Roth said, speaking at a conference hosted by the Knight Foundation, a journalism nonprofit.\n\nThe public reflections of a senior Twitter leader who had close contact with Musk in the raw, early days of his ownership of the company ‚Äî a period marked by internal tumult and a damaging advertiser revolt ‚Äî provide the latest evidence of a billionaire CEO who leads by his gut at the expense of virtually everyone else.\n\nThere was no explosive confrontation with Musk that led to Roth‚Äôs resignation, and the episode involving Twitter‚Äôs paid verification feature was only one of many factors that drove Roth‚Äôs decision to leave, he said. But the experience exemplified the kind of damage Musk‚Äôs freewheeling approach can do, Roth added, likening his final weeks at the company to standing before a leaky dam, trying desperately to plug the holes but knowing that eventually something would get past him.\n\nIn the hour-long interview, Roth warned Musk‚Äôs laissez-faire approach to content moderation, and his lack of a transparent process for making and enforcing platform policies, has made Twitter less safe, in part because there aren‚Äôt enough staff remaining who understand that malicious actors are constantly trying to game the system in ways that automated algorithms don‚Äôt know how to catch.\n\n‚ÄúPeople are not sitting still,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are actively devising new ways to be horrible on the internet.‚Äù\n\nHe urged Twitter users to monitor the functioning of key safety features such as muting, blocking and protected tweets as early warning signs the platform may be breaking down.\n\n‚ÄúIf protected tweets stop working, run,‚Äù he said.\n\nFor two weeks after Musk closed his purchase of Twitter, Roth presented himself as a voice of stability and calm at the center of a company undergoing dramatic change. Roth knew that by remaining at the company, Musk was using him to help keep advertisers from abandoning the platform. But Roth also suggested that he and others who did not leave Twitter may have been able to influence Musk and keep him from making damaging unilateral decisions, which he had ‚Äúmultiple opportunities‚Äù to do.\n\nEven as he spent his initial days in the new regime battling a ‚Äúsurge in hateful conduct on Twitter‚Äù apparently meant to test Musk‚Äôs tolerance for racism and antisemitism on the platform, Roth sought to reassure the public that Twitter‚Äôs trust and safety work continued unhindered.\n\nHe shared data on the platform‚Äôs ongoing enforcement efforts, and downplayed the impact of Twitter‚Äôs mass layoffs on its content moderation team, saying the job cuts were less severe in that department compared to the wider organization.\n\nAs late as Nov. 9, Roth spoke alongside Musk during a public Twitter Spaces event intended to persuade advertisers not to flee the platform. In the hour-long session, which was attended by more than 100,000 listeners, including representatives of Adidas, Chevron and other major brands, Roth waxed optimistic about Twitter‚Äôs plans to fight hate speech.\n\nThe very next day, Roth abruptly resigned, joining a slew of other senior executives including Twitter‚Äôs chief privacy officer and chief information security officer.\n\nIn a subsequent New York Times op-ed, Roth said his reason for leaving came down to Musk‚Äôs highly personal and improvisational approach to content moderation. Roth‚Äôs essay accused Musk of perpetuating a ‚Äúlack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-length pronouncements about Twitter‚Äôs rules.‚Äù\n\nOn Tuesday, Roth said the popular narrative that describes Musk as a villain is wrong and doesn‚Äôt reflect his own experiences with him. But, he said, Musk surrounds himself with those who rarely challenge him.\n\nBefore Musk took over Twitter, Roth wrote down several commitments to himself that would trigger the decision to quit. One limit, he said ‚Äî one that was never reached ‚Äî was that Roth would refuse to lie for Musk. Another limit, one that was ultimately reached and drove his decision to resign, was ‚Äúif Twitter starts being ruled by dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.‚Äù\n\nRoth‚Äôs role at Twitter came under intense scrutiny in 2020 after the company appended a fact-check message to false tweets by then-US President Donald Trump.\n\nTweets that Roth sent in 2016 and 2017 that were critical of President Trump and his supporters were dug up and used to argue that Roth and Twitter were biased against the president.\n\nAmong Roth‚Äôs tweets was one he wrote on Election Day 2016 that read, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.‚Äù\n\nTwitter defended Roth at the time, saying, ‚ÄúNo one person at Twitter is responsible for our policies or enforcement actions, and it‚Äôs unfortunate to see individual employees targeted for company decisions.‚Äù\n\nWhen Roth was still working at Twitter in October, Musk was asked about Roth‚Äôs old tweets.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs,‚Äù Musk tweeted.\n\nRoth also became the personal face of Twitter, and a target of harassment, after the company decided to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden, a decision then-CEO Jack Dorsey has since said was a mistake.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden story. That is not true. It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue,‚Äù Roth told Swisher on Tuesday.\n\nRoth did not feel removing the content from Twitter was appropriate, he said, but at the time the story seemed to bear the hallmarks of a hack-and-leak information operation. Roth also said Tuesday that, in retrospect, suppressing the Hunter Biden story was a mistake.\n\n‚ÄúThey were on alert from what happened in 2016 and all the hacked emails and things,‚Äù Swisher told CNN Wednesday morning, reflecting on her discussion with Roth.\n\nWhile Roth may have disagreed with suppressing the Hunter Biden story, he defended Twitter‚Äôs other decisions to ban Trump for his activities around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, as well as a personal account belonging to Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and an account belonging to the satirical website Babylon Bee.\n\nAll three cases involved obvious violations of Twitter‚Äôs publicly accessible, written policies, Roth said, making them a much clearer case for enforcement.\n\nAmid the layoffs that have decimated Twitter‚Äôs content moderation team, Musk has said he intends to rely much more heavily on crowdsourced fact-checking of tweets to provide context to misleading claims. But Roth said that in doing so, Twitter risks abdicating its responsibility to the public, which should still apply despite it being a private company.\n\nPolicymakers should require platforms to share data with academics and researchers, he said, preempting privately owned platforms such as Twitter from shirking a duty to transparency.\n\nAsked to give a single piece of advice to Musk going forward, Roth paused for the briefest of moments.\n\n‚ÄúHumility goes a really long way,‚Äù he said.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n- CNN‚Äôs Donie O‚ÄôSullivan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/29/transgender-children-families-flee-states-restricting-rights/10547110002/", "title": "Families with transgender kids flee states that aim to restrict rights", "text": "Most of the 300-plus bills proposed in 2022 targeting LGBTQ rights are aimed at transgender people, largely youth.\n\nAs 2022 midterm elections approach, some parents worried about legislative attacks on their transgender kids are fleeing home states.\n\nRelocating to trans-friendly states can mean losing jobs, family ties and childcare -- and bring a higher cost of living.\n\nFor former Dallas writer and teacher Violet Augustine, the alarm bells first went off in October 2021, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill banning trans kids from playing on sports teams aligned with their gender identity.\n\nSuddenly, the notion dawned on Augustine, whose 6-year-old trans daughter, Isa, is a skilled swimmer, that she might have to leave her native state. Probably within a decade, she figured. But when Dallas‚Äô Children‚Äôs Medical Center announced a month later that it was shutting down its acclaimed youth gender-affirming care program, her time estimate shrank by half.\n\nThen, in February, Abbott issued an order directing the state‚Äôs child-welfare agency to investigate providers of gender-affirming care for youth.\n\nSuddenly, Augustine‚Äôs timeline became immediate. Isa's school community had been, if not supportive, at least tolerant of her identity. She wondered: Are they going to report us now?\n\nIn June, Augustine, 37, decided to flee Texas for California, using the money she‚Äôd been saving to buy a home to fund their relocation.\n\nAs the 2022 midterms approach, an onslaught of legislation and rhetoric targeting transgender youth in recent years has prompted parents of transgender kids to ponder similar choices. Advocates say some have uprooted lives in states like Texas, Arizona, Alabama and Arkansas to find refuge in states they feel offer safer climates.\n\nMore than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in 2022, according to Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. Most aim to restrict the rights of trans people, largely trans youths' abilities to participate in sports or receive gender-affirming care.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a crisis,‚Äù said Kim Shappley, another former Texas resident parent who left the state with her transgender child this summer. ‚ÄúWe have political refugees in the U.S., leaving with whatever they can fit in their car.‚Äù\n\nSuch decisions can be critical: A nationwide survey of nearly 35,000 LGBTQ people in 2021 found that more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth had considered suicide in the previous year, and advocates say affirmation of gender identity is an important factor in youth mental health.\n\nMeanwhile, 85% of trans and binary youth reported that ongoing debates about state laws restricting transgender rights had negatively affected their mental health.\n\n‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre seeing state departments weaponized,‚Äù said Ricardo Martinez, CEO of LGBTQ advocacy agency Equality Texas. ‚ÄúThat has really cemented this culture of fear for parents who are just incredibly worried about their kids. They‚Äôre worried about dropping them off at school, fearing that phone call that their kid has been pulled out of class and that they‚Äôre being reported.‚Äù\n\nWhile the number of transgender families able or willing to leave their home states is thought to be comparatively low compared to those who stay, advocates say it‚Äôs tragic that parents are pushed to consider the possibility.\n\n‚ÄúWhy is it OK that they have to leave?‚Äù said Andrea Segovia, senior field and policy advisor for Transgender Education Network of Texas. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre terrified that their kid is going to commit suicide, or that if their kid has COVID and they go to a hospital for care that they might get reported.‚Äù\n\nOpponents of gender-affirming care for youth -- which includes hormone treatments, puberty blockers and behavioral approaches designed to support a child's identity -- say kids are too young to make potentially life-altering decisions about their gender identity.\n\nAdvocates say opponents are placing ideology over science, noting that surgery is rarely conducted for trans individuals under 18 and that withholding affirming care prevents doctors from providing best-practice treatment and puts transgender youth at risk by placing their emotional and physical well-being in jeopardy.\n\nBills denying such care have been opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nAllison Scott, director of impact and innovation for Campaign for Southern Equality, an advocacy agency supporting LGBTQ Southerners, said many families in states where such laws are passing or gaining steam choose to law low, unable to afford or manage a move or unwilling to break community ties.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just trying to survive and stay where they are,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we need protections at the federal level. People‚Äôs rights should not change with their zip code or the state they live in.‚Äù\n\nOthers, like Augustine, are desperate enough to leave that they tap funding sources like GoFundMe to help finance relocation, ditching previous life plans or sacrificing financial gain to escape as fast as possible.\n\n‚ÄúFor a lot of families who move, it wasn‚Äôt like they had that window of time to test the market and sell their house,‚Äù Segovia said. ‚ÄúA lot of families do depend on the generosity of others. But I also know of families who had to split up, where one parent took their kid to a family‚Äôs house in whatever place while the other parent had to stay and maintain their job. People are having to make hard choices in a quick amount of time.‚Äù\n\n'I thought the devil was trying to steal my kid'\n\nAt first, Augustine didn‚Äôt take seriously her toddler‚Äôs declarations of being a girl; but two years later, in late 2020, when Isa hadn‚Äôt changed and became distraught over her anatomy, Augustine researched the issue and figured maybe Isa was right.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I affirmed her and said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a girl, yeah,‚Äô the tension just melted from her body,‚Äù said Augustine, who separated from Isa‚Äôs father in 2019. ‚ÄúShe just lit up. It was almost like I‚Äôd never actually seen her smile until that day.‚Äù\n\nAn estimated 29,800 youth aged 13 to 17 identify as transgender in Texas, the country‚Äôs third highest such population behind California and New York, according to data compiled by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles' School of Law. Nationally, about 300,000 youth of that age group identify as transgender.\n\nAugustine let Isa, who had just turned five, dress the way she wanted, knowing there would be backlash from her mostly conservative family. Exposed to inflammatory rhetoric, they feared for her safety.\n\nThen, when Isa‚Äôs daycare facility dismissed her, saying she would be a distraction, ‚Äúthat was our first introduction to what it would be like to be trans in Texas,‚Äù Augustine said.\n\nThe experience was similar for Shappley, a single mom raised in a conservative family in rural Mississippi who ministered at a Houston megachurch when her child, Kai, told Shappley she was a girl.\n\nKai‚Äôs femininity had been evident as a toddler, Shappley said; she preferred girls‚Äô toys and pulled T-shirts around her waist like skirts, asking to grow her hair long.\n\n‚ÄúI thought the devil was trying to steal my kid,‚Äù Shappley said.\n\nShe tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù Kai, reading and talking to church leaders. Pursuing a nursing degree, she looked to her program for answers, learning that LGBTQ kids were more prone to depression, homelessness and human trafficking. What she learned about gender identity in psychology class mirrored her experience with Kai.\n\nOne day, despairing, she called her psychiatrist to vent. She‚Äôd stepped outside so the kids wouldn‚Äôt hear and was pacing her driveway when the doctor posed a question that changed everything.\n\n‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòIf you were on a desert island, just you and Kai, and she wanted to wear girls‚Äô clothes, are you going to let her?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòYeah.‚Äô And she said, ‚ÄòYou know, your problem isn‚Äôt your God. Your problem is how you think other people are going to see you.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThat was when Shappley decided it wasn‚Äôt Kai‚Äôs transition she needed to worry about. It was her own.\n\n‚ÄúBefore Kai, I thought it was a choice,‚Äù Shappley said. ‚ÄúAs Christians, you know, I thought you just showed them love so that you could change them and prevent them from going to hell. What I know now is that‚Äôs just manipulation and incredibly harmful.‚Äù\n\nAcceptance came with its own problems. Kai, in girls‚Äô clothes, was booted from daycares after other parents complained. Family members and once-close friends have fallen away ‚Äì people whose weddings Shappley had performed or supported in hospital delivery rooms.\n\nIn suburban Houston, school administrators ignored Kai‚Äôs identity. Shappley, advocating on her behalf, faced harassment at school board meetings ‚Äì and then, as she became more visible, in store parking lots.\n\nEventually, she felt forced to move her family to Austin, feeling secure enough there that she and Kai both testified before the Texas Legislature against proposed anti-trans legislation. Still, it was becoming clear to her, she said, that targeting trans kids was shaping up to be a GOP strategy.\n\nThen came Abbott‚Äôs directive. Having just reestablished her financial footing after leaving Houston, Shappley felt forced to consider moving again.\n\nMoving to a new state\n\nSome aren‚Äôt as fortunate. Anya Phenix, a North Texas mom whose 17-year-old child, Levi, came out as transgender after his father died in 2017, has had little luck scraping together the necessary resources to leave the state.\n\nPhenix, 48, has been going by that name since 2012 when she left her church \"because of the hate I was seeing\" over LGBTQ identity issues and wanted a way to write about the subject without further straining her family relationships.\n\nFor her, everything hinges on next month‚Äôs gubernatorial contest. While a district judge has since granted temporary protection from Abbott‚Äôs order to member families of PFLAG under a lawsuit filed by Lambda Legal and Texas‚Äô American Civil Liberties Union, she and Levi are using their new chosen names to avoid potential prosecution.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping Beto (O‚ÄôRourke, Texas‚Äô Democratic candidate) wins, but if he doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôll have to get out as fast as we can because it looks like things will spiral fast,‚Äù Phenix said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been looking at Colorado, but the laws are changing everywhere, so we‚Äôre up in the air as far as where we‚Äôll end up.‚Äù\n\nPhenix had hoped to leave the state as soon as her lease ends in December, but for a single parent supporting a child and his disabled best friend, the situation isn‚Äôt promising. She works as a barista in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, struggling to find more substantial employment after not working for 10 years while she homeschooled Levi.\n\nHer husband, who‚Äôd driven a rented car for a ride-sharing service, died three days after suffering a stroke. The vehicle was reclaimed by the company, leaving Phenix without transportation; her survivor benefits, about $1,500 a month, expire in June.\n\nShe launched a GoFundMe page in hopes of getting a car, which she says she‚Äôll need not only for work but to relocate wherever she decides to go.\n\n‚ÄúAll our friends are here,‚Äù Phenix said. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt want to have to leave‚Ä¶ I have moments of fear every day. We‚Äôre wondering what‚Äôs going to happen to us, whether we‚Äôre going to have enough money to support our needs ‚Äì and how we‚Äôre going to stay safe.‚Äù\n\nMoving can disrupt employment status, childcare arrangements and community bonds.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre losing your work and your family, and a lot of people depend on family and friends for childcare,‚Äù said Scott, of the Campaign for Southern Equality. ‚ÄúThen you have the economy ‚Äì a lot of people are struggling with housing and don‚Äôt have the resources to pick up and move. You can‚Äôt just give people $5,000 or even $10,000 and expect that to fix their problems.‚Äù\n\nLast year, less than 40% of Americans said they could handle an unexpected $1,000 expense, even after federal stimulus funding pumped trillions of dollars into the economy, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nThe places parents and advocates cite as friendlier environments for trans kids tend to be more expensive than those that families seek to leave.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have that many states to move to,‚Äù said Shappley, who in July left Texas for Connecticut with Kai, Kai's 9-year-old brother, Kaleb, and their dog and three cats. The trip took two and a half days, camping at roadside parks for a few hours along the way because hotels wouldn‚Äôt take all their animals.\n\nHer electric bill has since tripled, and her rent is double what it was in Austin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing this since Kai was 5 years old, so I‚Äôm just ready to exhale.‚Äù\n\nAt age 11, Kai is an activist in her own right, nominated as Time magazine's 2021 \"Kid of the Year\" and featured along with her mother in several magazine articles and a documentary.\n\nShappley sees similarities in the tactics employed against trans kids and those used a half-century ago in the wake of Roe v. Wade ‚Äì the harassment and bomb threats against clinics providing abortion services then and those offering gender-affirming care now. And while many of those threats prove to be just that, the chilling effect is the same: Clinics shutting down and clients staying away out of fear.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not going to go away,‚Äù she said.\n\nScott said even proposed legislation can prompt clinics and programs to shut down for fear of legal repercussions. Some, she said, never reopen if such bills fail because program staff have left for friendlier climates in the meantime, ‚Äúand these legislators are smart enough to know that.‚Äù\n\nAfter Abbott‚Äôs order sent many parents of trans kids into hiding, representatives of Equality Texas attended a child welfare services department hearing and read the stories and statements of those afraid to make their own case. Afterward, CEO Martinez said, a department trustee approached them, saying only 13 families had been investigated and that the advocates were wasting their time.\n\n‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt impact only 13 families,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis has a chilling effect on how people can live their lives.‚Äù\n\nFor families able to leave, there are mixed feelings ‚Äì the relief of leaving a hostile situation, sadness over leaving loved ones and losing one‚Äôs way of life, guilt over not staying to fight for families in similar situations.\n\nAugustine decided on the Los Angeles area, aware of an LGBTQ children‚Äôs organization there she thought would be affirming for Isa, who‚Äôll turn seven next month.\n\n‚ÄúI knew that we‚Äôd have chosen family to hang out with,‚Äù she said.\n\nAt first, Augustine was relieved to have left Texas, but as she processed her plight, her feelings became more complicated. In Dallas, she‚Äôd had a two-bedroom house with a yard; in California, they live in a one-bedroom apartment, with no backyard for Isa to play in.\n\n‚ÄúThe states that are safe for her are more expensive than Texas, so that was a reality I couldn‚Äôt escape,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut as long as the laws here continue to be supportive, we‚Äôll stay and I‚Äôll hustle and make it work financially.‚Äù\n\nThe situation has also affected Augustine‚Äôs job prospects. Getting by as a writer and podcaster, she recently declined a college teaching opportunity in Milwaukee, she said, unconvinced that Wisconsin‚Äôs climate for transgender kids was much better than in Texas.\n\nWhile Isa, being so young, has responded with resilience, Augustine said she longs for the sleepovers she used to enjoy with Augustine‚Äôs mother.\n\n‚ÄúThe hardest part is that Isa misses her family,‚Äù Augustine said. ‚ÄúShe tells me that every day, and it breaks my heart. It‚Äôs hard on me too. I used to have a lot of help, and now I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just keeping my head above water and doing what I have to do.‚Äù", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/opinions/gun-violence-crime-solutions-roundup/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Who is at fault for America's soaring gun violence?

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN ‚Äî\n\nConcerns about violent crime and guns remain top of mind for American voters, polls show time and again. These issues certainly stick with Kathy Pisabaj, of Chicago, who was 19 in 2018 when she was shot by a stranger and nearly died.\n\n‚ÄúWe believed that if we stayed away from gangs, we would not get hurt,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúGun violence continues to tear apart communities and devastate lives like mine every single day.‚Äù\n\nWe asked experts working in various fields what they think needs to be done ‚Äì what can reasonably be done ‚Äì so that all of us can feel a bit safer.\n\nRicky Aiken: ‚ÄòReal change happens when the people who need it, lead it‚Äô\n\nRicky Aiken Inner City Innovators\n\nI grew up in the Tamarind Avenue corridor of West Palm Beach, which is notorious for poverty, drug abuse and violent crime. It‚Äôs just a few miles from what was the ‚ÄúWinter White House,‚Äù or Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSummer is typically a deadly time of year for communities like ours. Young people are out of school with nothing to do and have easy access to firearms. And when gun violence happens in our communities, it‚Äôs not outsiders tearing up our communities. It‚Äôs insiders.\n\nIn 2015, the rate of violent crime in West Palm Beach was the same as Chicago. That summer, my cousin and I were lamenting the fact that every time we turned on the news, someone we knew had been shot or someone we knew was the suspect in a shooting. We decided to try to do something about it.\n\nI was 26 and working the graveyard shift at an emergency shelter for displaced youth. My cousin, then 28, was a maintenance worker at a local nonprofit. Together, we went on to create Inner City Innovators, a nonprofit with three initiatives.\n\nOne of them is our Hope Dealer mentoring program, which combines individual and peer-to-peer mentoring, leadership development, community service and social-emotional learning. We prioritize giving youth (13+) someone to talk to.\n\nOur anti-violence workshops go into schools, community centers, anywhere with kids. We talk about how to reduce their chances of being victimized by gun violence.\n\nAnd then through community engagement activities we walk the streets to let the community know we‚Äôre here. We respond to shootings when youth are involved, hoping to connect with families to support them and reduce retaliation.\n\nWe also do court advocacy. A lot of young men get gun charges early on, at 15 or 16. Once they‚Äôre in that kind of trouble, no traditional mentoring program accepts them. We build partnerships with public defenders and judges working with juveniles to give these young men a second chance.\n\nAny young man in our program gets help with job placement and therapy. If he is having trouble keeping food in the house, we fill up his refrigerator.\n\nOur goal is simple: to keep every young man in our program free and alive through age 25. Most offending starts around 13, and 25 is when they say the brain is finished developing. We want to capture and stabilize them when this demographic is known to struggle the most.\n\nWe don‚Äôt want to just keep them alive physically. We want to keep them alive spiritually and emotionally as well. We introduce them to yoga, mindfulness, out-of-the-hood experiences. When you‚Äôre born and raised in a community of constant disadvantage, you think everywhere is like that. We want to inspire them to do more.\n\nLack of education, poverty of community, brokenness of home ‚Äì those aren‚Äôt sources of shame. Those are sources of power. I want them to use these things to make better decisions in their lives.\n\nWe give them space to be involved and space to lead. When you challenge a young person who‚Äôs been through hard times, they want to stand up and show you they‚Äôre capable.\n\nWe‚Äôve built a culture that accepts goodness, and we‚Äôre expanding. We have a playbook we want to send to other places.\n\nWe can‚Äôt stop all shootings. But of the young men who‚Äôve been involved in our Hope Dealer mentoring program and have firearm charges, most stay on the path we put them on and leave activities that require picking up firearms behind them.\n\nRicky Aiken is the founder and executive director of Inner City Innovators, a nonprofit based in West Palm Beach, Florida, that combats crime rates and gun violence by empowering and inspiring inner-city youth through mentoring programs, anti-violence workshops and community engagement. This piece was adapted from an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jessica Ravitz Cherof.\n\nCharlie Dent: Stopping lawlessness takes political will\n\nCharlie Dent CNN\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote about the alarming incidents of violent crime in Philadelphia. I recounted the city‚Äôs record-breaking homicide rate and shared how crime affected my two children.\n\nA college classmate of my son‚Äôs was murdered during an attempted carjacking. My daughter, a physician in residency, was assaulted. In the eight months since I wrote that piece, circumstances haven‚Äôt changed.\n\nMy son‚Äôs friends, living in his former apartment, were robbed at gunpoint during a home invasion. My daughter scolded me recently for wearing an Apple Watch while walking two blocks to dinner because she feared I would be mugged.\n\nAmerica has a crime problem, and it weighs heavily on the minds of people who live in those high crime jurisdictions and those who care for them. Even if crime polls lower than issues like inflation or abortion among voters‚Äô concerns, no one should underestimate the potency of crime as a political issue.\n\nWhile most crime is prosecuted at the state and local levels, the political implications at the federal level are palpable. Republican congressional candidates are deploying the crime issue effectively against Democrats because it resonates with base and swing voters. As a matter of damage control, House Democrats recently passed a package of four police funding bills in an attempt to shore up support among voters who believe them to be too soft on crime or in support of defunding the police.\n\nWhile these funding bills no doubt will be welcomed, they do not address the underlying issues driving up crime rates. It feels like police have been placed on the back foot. The era of proactive policing has come to an end, and violent crime has soared. A new wave of progressive district attorneys bent on criminal justice reform, in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, have run into the hard wall of angry residents demanding public safety.\n\nAt this point, the most important thing that can be done to address the crime problem is for local district attorneys, mayors and council members to demonstrate publicly their support for law enforcement officers and allow them to do what needs to be done, with reasonable oversight and accountability, to restore order. Morale is low in too many police departments and district attorney offices throughout the country, leading to dangerously high turnover rates while leaving behind understaffed and less experienced police officers and prosecutors.\n\nFinally, Republicans need to move more on gun safety. I give credit to Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut for their leadership on gun safety with the recent enactment of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. But more needs to be done. Universal firearm background checks, red flag laws, bump stock bans and raising the age for most long-gun purchases to 21 will not infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners.\n\nIt‚Äôs long past time to address the blatant lawlessness in communities across the country. There is no reason we can‚Äôt do it. It just takes political will.\n\nCharlie Dent is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who served as chair of the House Ethics Committee and chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies. He is a CNN political commentator.\n\nAditi Bussells: Don‚Äôt underestimate the ‚Äòmagic of local government‚Äô\n\nAditi Bussells courtesy Aditi Bussells\n\nWe‚Äôre all tired of the state of politics in our country today. Tired of the tweets, the bickering and the polarization. And so, when people ask why I decided to run for city council as a public health researcher, I remind folks that the local level is where we can really make change and impact our community.\n\nLike many other parts of the country, Columbia, South Carolina, has seen an uptick in gun violence over the last several years.\n\nWith our hands tied by preemption laws, which allow state laws to preempt what local governments can do, and the challenges of South Carolina‚Äôs deep red political climate, we‚Äôve had to get creative and develop relationships across the spectrum of viewpoints around gun violence to be successful.\n\nWe started with Columbia‚Äôs ‚ÄúLock it Up Campaign,‚Äù to increase safe firearm storage. We partnered with our police department and local community groups to launch a robust gun safety campaign. We handed out informational materials and gun locks to help address unintentional injuries and deaths caused by firearms. The National Crime Prevention Council reports that 89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children happen in the home, when children play with loaded guns.\n\nThe campaign was so successful, we ran out of gun locks within an hour. Our state gun armory took notice and donated another 150 locks and helped us spread the word. This campaign wasn‚Äôt going to solve the entire problem of gun violence, but it made the statement that our city will do its part. And that mattered to our citizens.\n\nNext, I led efforts to pass the first law in South Carolina to require citizens in the city to report a lost or stolen gun within 24 hours of knowing the gun is gone, given that South Carolina is third in the country for guns stolen out of vehicles.\n\nI engaged some of our most conservative legislators in the state house, submitted the ordinance to the state attorney general‚Äôs office in its draft stage and even talked to the NRA. This approach was a first for our city. We ended up with a law that had unanimous support and, most importantly, a law that can play a role in preventing future gun violence and keep our city safe.\n\nThis is the magic of local government. We can build momentum for change quickly and effectively. We can bring people together to have conversations about our communities. We can offer hope to our neighbors who seek a safer world, free of violence.\n\nAditi Bussells, who holds a PhD in public health, is the city councilwoman at-large in Columbia, South Carolina. She is the first South Asian woman to be elected to local government in the history of South Carolina.\n\nQuinton Lucas: ‚ÄòGun reform cannot solve our violence problem alone‚Äô\n\nMayor Quinton Lucas City of Kansas City\n\nTwo years ago, Kansas City lost 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed while sleeping, after a shooter opened fire on his father‚Äôs home. LeGend should still be alive, and so should the thousands of other children, particularly Black and brown youth, taken too soon by gun violence in our country.\n\nToday, the leading cause of death of young people in America is gun violence ‚Äì not cancer, not car accidents, but preventable gun tragedies.\n\nMayors across the country are dealing with the flood of illegal guns on our streets and lax gun regulations more than ever before. This year‚Äôs midterm election will be critical for electing those who champion common-sense gun reforms to avoid the slaughter of our babies in their school classrooms.\n\nBut gun reform cannot solve our violence problem alone. Good investment in housing and social services is essential to public safety. When people are housed and their needs are met, there‚Äôs less crime. These investments need to be embedded in candidate conversations about public safety.\n\nIn Kansas City, we continue to make historic progress in housing access. Funding from the new Kansas City Housing Trust Fund will create nearly 500 affordable housing units and a bond measure to go before voters next month, should it pass, will generate thousands of more affordable housing units. We‚Äôve also launched Zero KC, a plan to end homelessness in our city in five years.\n\nWe‚Äôve fought back against gun violence through municipal ordinances when our state refuses to act, making it a locally enforceable violation for domestic violence offenders and minors to carry firearms. We‚Äôve expanded violence prevention outreach, intervening with those who may be at risk for engaging in gun violence and retaliation.\n\nIn 2020, my administration sued Jimenez Arms, a gun manufacturer that provided guns to felons, allowing illegal guns to flood our streets and causing significant harm to our community. But the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted a deficient investigation before granting a new license to the operators of Jimenez Arms. Because of ATF‚Äôs refusal to act, we sued the agency, too, and eventually shut down Jimenez Arms, keeping their weapons of war off our streets.\n\nWhile we make progress, we‚Äôre rowing against the political headwinds of our state, the US Supreme Court and the US Congress. The bipartisan gun safety bill, signed into law this summer, is a start; it provides some common sense gun violence solutions, but it should embolden us to do more and continue to act.\n\nIn this fall‚Äôs midterm elections, vote for people who care about your kids‚Äô lives. If your candidate cannot ensure your children will be safe at school every day, or ensure you‚Äôll be safe going to the grocery store, question whether they are the best candidate for your community.\n\nKeeping people in our cities alive is more important than anything and is not about rhetoric. If people and kids are dying preventable deaths, we are failing.\n\nDemocratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, elected in 2019, is chairman of the US Conference of Mayors Criminal and Social Justice Committee and is co-chair of Everytown for Gun Safety‚Äôs Mayors Against Illegal Guns.\n\nZirui Song: Reducing firearm injuries is good for health ‚Äì and business\n\nDr. Zirui Song Courtesy Dr. Zirui Song\n\nAs members of the public, we tend to hear about gun violence through the tragedy of innocent lives lost. But those shot who survive are often quickly forgotten.\n\nIt is easy to think that survivors will be OK. But though they may be fortunate, in many ways they are not OK.\n\nSurvivors of gun violence face not only the pain of the physical injury, but a 51% increase in mental health disorders and 85% increase in substance use disorders. The former includes depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and more. The latter includes alcohol and drug misuse, sometimes addiction to the very opioids used to treat the pain of the gunshot wound.\n\nThese effects persist at least a year after injury. While the world has moved on ‚Äì at times to the next mass shooting ‚Äì survivors are still learning how to walk again, battling demons to go outside again and suffering through their personal, slow-moving tragedies out of the public eye. This is the quiet base of the proverbial iceberg ‚Äì not the tip that captivates attention.\n\nAnd its ripple effects are profound.\n\nLoved ones are not unscathed. Family members of survivors, despite not being shot themselves, also experience a 12% increase in mental health disorders in the year following the survivor‚Äôs injury.\n\nCommunity members are not unscathed. Trauma, anguish and survivor guilt await.\n\nSociety is not unscathed. Every nonfatal firearm injury costs employers and insurers $30,000 in direct medical spending in the first year. This pays for emergency rooms, hospitals, doctor visits, procedures, imaging and tests, among other services. Ultimately, this comes out of everyone‚Äôs taxes or wages, with the victims paying 4% of it out-of-pocket themselves. So whether in health or economic terms, we all share in the pain of gun violence.\n\nWith somewhere around 85,000 survivors of firearm injuries each year ‚Äì a number our nation is not sure about due to a shortage of data ‚Äì society thus pays an estimated $2.5 billion for direct medical care in the first year alone. Imagine the other societal needs that $2.5 billion could help address.\n\nBut even that severely undercounts the economic toll. Employers lose an estimated $535 million in revenue and productivity each year, with the rate of employees and dependents getting shot rising four-fold from 2007 to 2020. Add that to quality-of-life costs to victims and families, police and criminal justice costs, and health care spending, gun violence as a whole is estimated to cost the US $557 billion each year, or roughly 2.6% of the nation‚Äôs economy.\n\nSo while the health case for reducing gun violence has long been with us as people die and get hurt, and the moral case weighs heavily as guns are now the leading cause of death among kids and adolescents in our country, the business case is growing more obvious.\n\nThis was echoed in a letter from CEOs for Gun Safety to US senators, which was publicized in June, urging lawmakers to pass gun safety legislation. Hundreds of company executives signed the letter, calling gun violence a ‚Äúpublic health crisis‚Äù that ‚Äú[o]n top of the human toll‚Äù has a ‚Äúprofound economic impact.‚Äù Moreover, they stated, ‚ÄúCommunities that experience gun violence struggle to attract investment, create jobs, and see economic growth.‚Äù\n\nThe voice of the business community is important for public health. Indeed, the private sector has been a partner in public health before, from addressing the tobacco epidemic, to combating the opioid epidemic, to expanding health insurance.\n\nIncreasingly, preventing firearm injuries is not only good for health, but good for business. And, ultimately, the business case may rest not on minimizing the cost side of their ledger, but rather on an alignment of values with consumers that drives the revenue side.\n\nShoppers, notably young people, are increasingly devoting their dollars to businesses that resonate with their values. As the sheer number of people affected by gun violence grows and their demand for change mounts, companies that do something about it may be better off than those that do not.\n\nDr. Zirui Song is an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nCharmaine McGuffey: Bring back concealed carry license requirements\n\nSheriff Charmaine McGuffey Provided by Charmaine McGuffey\n\nFor 35 years, I‚Äôve worn a uniform for Ohio‚Äôs Hamilton County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. I started as a young officer and moved up the ranks. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked as a self-defense instructor, trained officers on firearm safety and ran the corrections training academy for the Sheriff‚Äôs Office.\n\nLaw enforcement officers must complete countless hours of firearm training prior to being certified ‚Äì and even we are less accurate in a crisis situation. I‚Äôm 95% accurate on a good day, when I‚Äôm stationary in front of a target. But introduce loud noises, sirens, the darkness of night, lots of people and someone running at me, my skill level ‚Äì despite all my training ‚Äì will go down. And the likelihood that I, or any trained officer, will hit something we don‚Äôt intend to hit goes up. This has been known in law enforcement for decades.\n\nTraining creates an awareness of your immense responsibility in carrying a firearm. To carry a weapon with no training makes us all less safe.\n\nThat‚Äôs part of the reason I spoke out last year against Ohio SB215, which was signed into law and went into effect in June. The bill removed the concealed carry license requirement which mandates eight hours of training and background checks. It also eliminated the requirement of citizens to announce to a deputy that they have a concealed weapon if stopped.\n\nBy removing these requirements, law enforcement officers are more in danger ‚Äì and so is everyone else.\n\nToday, the state of Ohio allows virtually anyone 21 years of age or older to conceal carry a firearm without a license that requires a background check to determine any criminal records. I, as the Sheriff of Hamilton County, now have no oversight over who carries a concealed weapon. Prior to this bill being passed, I rescinded last year some 200 concealed carry permits from those charged with crimes such as domestic violence or assault. Now, I can‚Äôt do that, and those 200 people can conceal carry without the benefit of law enforcement oversight.\n\nTo those politicians who claim to be all about law and order ‚Äì and pro-police ‚Äì I want to say, ‚ÄúReally? How are you sticking by this?‚Äù\n\nThe bipartisan gun safety bill that was signed into law this summer is an absolute band-aid. It doesn‚Äôt address my concerns about the safety of law enforcement officers, citizens and children. It‚Äôs a way that politicians can placate the various sides on this issue, but it doesn‚Äôt go nearly far enough. It‚Äôs a way of saying, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a little something we agree on,‚Äù but I think we agree on a lot more than that. Most importantly, in a poll of Ohio residents, 90% were in favor of background checks for anyone purchasing a weapon. This bill does not include that basic element.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nOhio residents should have the opportunity to vote on age limits and strict background checks for anyone who is purchasing a firearm and for those who conceal carry.\n\nWhat we‚Äôre now concerned with is our own training, how to work around this flawed legislation and how to keep ourselves safe. We‚Äôre going to keep an accounting of what goes wrong, point out what could have been prevented and pay attention. We‚Äôll continue to fight to rescind this law, and we‚Äôll continue to offer and encourage licenses and training.\n\nAll of us, as citizens of this great nation, have a responsibility to help prevent gun violence.

Wade.\n\nSeveral states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women‚Äôs choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.\n\nAbout 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n‚ÄúThis fall, Roe is on the ballot,‚Äù President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling earlier this year.\n\nWhile CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.\n\nHere‚Äôs a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.\n\nMontana rejects abortion measure that would allow criminal penalties on health care providers\n\nVoters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.\n\nLR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant ‚Äúborn alive‚Äù ‚Äì defined as an infant ‚Äúat any stage of development‚Äù who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction ‚Äì be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.\n\nA health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report ‚Äúa failure to comply with the requirements‚Äù to law enforcement.\n\nMontana currently prohibits abortions past viability ‚Äì ‚Äúthe ability of a fetus to live outside the mother‚Äôs womb‚Äù ‚Äì except to save the life or health of the woman.\n\nLast year, the state‚Äôs Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.\n\nBackers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasn‚Äôt needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.\n\nHillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 ‚Äúzeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony,‚Äù she previously told CNN.\n\nKentucky rejects proposal that would have further restricted abortion rights\n\nKentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state‚Äôs constitution to say that it does not ‚Äúsecure or protect a right‚Äù to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.\n\nThe ballot question voters faced read: ‚ÄúAre you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?‚Äù\n\nKentucky‚Äôs ‚Äútrigger law,‚Äù which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.\n\nKentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù would ‚Äúensure there‚Äôs no false interpretation of the constitution.‚Äù\n\nWithout the amendment, ‚Äúinstead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people‚Äôs will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,‚Äù Wuchner said.\n\nTamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would ‚Äúopen the door to more attacks on abortion access,‚Äù but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to ‚Äúcontinue to fight back‚Äù against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.\n\nIf adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.\n\nMichigan enshrines abortion rights\n\nMichigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state‚Äôs constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.\n\nThe passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an ‚Äúindividual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.‚Äù\n\nMichigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts.

Wade in June.\n\n2022 Kentucky election results:See all the election results in one spot\n\nKentucky's GOP-controlled General Assembly, which put the constitutional amendment on the ballot, and Yes for Life which campaigned for it, had consistently predicted a win, arguing Kentucky is one of the most \"pro-life\" states in the country. The ballot measure was among more than a dozen bills approved by Kentucky lawmakers in recent years to restrict or ban abortion.\n\nBut opponents, led by Protect Kentucky Access, argued the measure was too extreme and would allow current laws to remain in place that ban abortion even in cases of rape, incest or fetal anomalies. Abortion is allowed in Kentucky only to save the life of or prevent a disabling injury to a pregnant patient.\n\nKentucky's vote followed the defeat in August of a similar measure in Kansas to eliminate abortion rights from that state's constitution, a vote that reverberated nationwide coming just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion.\n\nIn Kansas, the ballot measure was rejected by about 18 percentage points. Sweet, the manager of Kentucky's campaign against the amendment, also managed the opponents' campaign in Kansas.\n\nIn Kentucky, the vote appeared closer, with the win about 6 percentage points. And the vote divided largely along urban and rural lines, with votes against the amendment concentrated in urban areas while in most other counties a majority favored it. In Jefferson County, 71% of voters, and in Fayette, 73% of voters, voted against the measure.\n\nPassage of the measure would have guaranteed there is no state right to abortion in Kentucky's constitution and would put an end to legal challenges seeking to overturn state laws that restrict or ban abortion.\n\nDefeat of the amendment means that reproductive rights supporters may still seek to have abortion declared a state right through legal challenges to existing laws.\n\nLouisville mayor election: Democrat Craig Greenberg defeats Republican Bill Dieruf\n\nThe ballot measure took on new importance in Kentucky when the Supreme Court on June 24 struck down Roe v. Wade. Kentucky was among about a dozen states with \"trigger laws\" to ban abortion in the event of such a ruling.\n\nAnd it is one of multiple states where abortion rights supporters have gone to state courts, seeking to establish abortion as a right under state constitutions.\n\nThe state's two abortion providers, Planned Parenthood and EMW Women's Surgical Center, the latter represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, have filed suit seeking to have abortion declared a state right. Abortion, except for a medical emergency, remains banned while the case is pending.\n\nAbortion services, except in the event of medical emergency, have not been available since the state's two abortion providers, both in Louisville, were forced to suspend those services.\n\nProtect Kentucky Access included abortion rights supporters and several social justice groups. Yes for Life members included Kentucky Right to Life, the Catholic Conference of Kentucky and the Kentucky Baptist Convention.\n\nKentucky Amendment 2 states: \"To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"\n\nAfter the federal right to abortion ended, advocates took a legal challenge to state court in Kentucky, seeking to establish it as a state right.\n\nJefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry in July ruled in favor of abortion rights, issuing a temporary injunction against Kentucky's trigger law and another banning abortion after six weeks.\n\nBut Attorney General Daniel Cameron, an anti-abortion Republican, appealed that order, and it was suspended while the state Supreme Court considers the case. Meanwhile, no abortions have been available in the state, except for medical emergencies.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set Nov. 15 for a hearing in the case.\n\nContact reporter Deborah Yetter at dyetter@courier-journal.com or on Twitter at @d_yetter.

The Oklahoma attorney general‚Äôs office countered on Tuesday that the state constitution allows for laws criminalizing abortion and that such laws date back almost to statehood.\n\nAbortion had been effectively outlawed in Oklahoma even before the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24 reversed the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade and the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v Casey. Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a ban in May that uses civil lawsuits by private citizens as the enforcement mechanism.\n\nThe day the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Roe and Casey decisions, a \"trigger law\" made effective a 1910 Oklahoma statute that makes it a felony, punishable from two to five years in prison, to provide an abortion or help procure an abortion. A state law that goes into effect on Aug. 27 would raise the potential penalties to 10 years and a fine of $100,000; that law makes an exception only ‚Äúto save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency.‚Äù It would not penalize the mother.\n\nIn a petition to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, abortion providers led by the Oklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice say, ‚ÄúThe revival of the 1910 Ban and the enactment of the 2022 Ban are the products of a decades-long mission to force pregnant Oklahomans to give birth against their will and to make Petitioners (abortion providers) into criminals for providing and supporting essential health care.\n\nMore:Stitt launches task force aimed at supporting families through pregnancies in post-Roe era\n\n‚ÄúNow that Roe and Casey have been overturned, the question for this court in this case, and other cases challenging the overlapping abortion bans enacted by the Legislature, is whether the broad protection for individual liberty in the Oklahoma Constitution bars the state from running roughshod over the choices of Oklahomans who are pregnant. It does.‚Äù\n\nIn a response filed Tuesday, Oklahoma Attorney General John O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs office said, ‚ÄúSimply put, there is no fundamental right in the Oklahoma Constitution to kill a whole, separate, unique, and living human being in the womb. Oklahoma‚Äôs longstanding criminal law protecting the unborn is rational, as is the similar law set to take effect in August ‚Ä¶ Through their elected representatives, Oklahomans have spoken with one voice throughout the history of our State: Abortion, our citizens clearly believe, should be illegal.‚Äù\n\nStitt carries through on vow to appoint anti-abortion justices\n\nWith his third appointment last year, Stitt gave the Oklahoma Supreme Court for the first time a majority of justices appointed by Republican governors. Stitt vowed to appoint anti-abortion justices to the nine-member court.\n\nThe governor‚Äôs first appointment, of M.

The abortion views of his third appointment, Dana Lynn Kuehn, were not public. Appointments to the court are not subject to confirmation by the Legislature.\n\nThe issue of whether the Oklahoma Constitution guarantees a right to abortion has been raised previously with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2019, in a challenge to a state law restricting the use of dismemberment abortion, a Tulsa clinic argued that the Oklahoma Constitution‚Äôs protections for abortion were even stronger than those in the U.S. Constitution and that a 1980 decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court had affirmed a woman‚Äôs right ‚Äúto make her own decisions regarding her own health, including about whether to continue or end a pregnancy.‚Äù\n\nAbortion providers suing the state over more recent laws have asked the state Supreme Court to include that challenge in the current case.\n\nAbortion providers: Right to terminate pregnancy an 'inherent right'\n\nIn their latest petition, providers say the right to terminate a pregnancy is protected in the constitution‚Äôs guarantee of an ‚Äúinherent right‚Äù to ‚Äúliberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen a person is forced to remain pregnant or give birth against her will, she is subjected to a violation of her most inherent rights,‚Äù the petition states.\n\nThe state attorney general‚Äôs office argued Tuesday that abortion providers were making the same arguments that were ‚Äúdismantled‚Äù by the U.S. Supreme Court last month in striking down abortion precedents.\n\nAbortion was illegal in various Native American nations and in Indian Territory before statehood and was made illegal in Oklahoma soon after statehood, the attorney general said in the brief.\n\n‚ÄúThere is an enormous logical leap between saying that Oklahoma‚Äôs founders intended Oklahomans to have robust and inalienable individual liberties ‚Äî even stronger than Americans more broadly ‚Äî and declaring that these liberties somehow include a fundamental right to kill an unborn human being, especially when those same framers were perfectly comfortable with criminalizing abortion to protect the unborn.‚Äù\n\nIt is not known when the Oklahoma Supreme Court will rule.\n\nThe U.S. House is expected to consider two abortion bills this week, one that would attempt to put abortion rights into federal law and another that would prevent states with laws against abortion from punishing women who go to another state for an abortion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/26/kentuckys-constitutional-amendment-on-abortion-mean/10609859002/", "title": "Kentucky voters could explicitly ban the right to abortions with state ...", "text": "Kentucky's Nov. 8 general election ballot this year includes Constitutional Amendment 2, which could explicitly ban the right to abortions in the commonwealth.\n\nThough constitutional amendments ‚àí often in dense legal jargon ‚àí tend to make voters eyes glaze over, supporters and opponents predict this one is different.\n\nThe topic fired up voters in Kansas, where an unexpectedly large turnout in August rejected by 18 percentage points a similar attempt to eliminate abortion rights from that state's constitution.\n\nKentucky's one-sentence amendment states:\n\n\"To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"\n\nWATCH:Biden vows to 'veto' attempts to ban abortion, codify Roe if Democrats elected in midterms\n\nEDUCATION:In states where abortion is now outlawed, students ramp up activism\n\nWhat the vote on Kentucky's abortion amendment could do\n\nIf approved, the measure changes Kentucky's constitution to eliminate the right to abortion.\n\nIf rejected, it leaves open the possibility abortion could be declared a state right.\n\nAnd with Kentucky among states that have largely banned abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v.

The event was hosted by state Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, Protect Kentucky Access, a group formed to fight the amendment, and the National Council of Jewish Women's Louisville chapter.\n\nThe proposed amendment, approved last year by the Republican-controlled Kentucky General Assembly consists of one line: \"To protect human life, nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\" To take effect, a majority of voters must approve it.\n\nAnd a major battle over the amendment is shaping up, with both sides calling it hugely important in deciding the future of abortion ‚àíwhich currently is banned by state law after the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24 struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that for 49 years made abortion a federal right.\n\n\"We need to show up on Nov. 8 to vote this down,\" Kulkarni said, adding that if the amendment passes, it will cut off legal challenges to restrictive state abortion laws.\n\nBut a group called Yes for Life, whose members include Kentucky Right to Life, the Catholic Conference of Kentucky and the Kentucky Baptist Convention, say they plan to fight just as hard to ensure the amendment is passed in order to derail a pending legal challenge to Kentucky abortion laws and block future challenges.\n\nThe goal is \"to make sure you do not have radical judges making law from the bench,\" said Addia Wuchner, executive director of Right to Life and chair of the Yes for Life campaign.\n\nMore:Author of Kentucky's abortion ban is making a partisan bid for Supreme Court seat\n\nOn June 30, Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry temporarily blocked Kentucky's ban on abortion that took effect after Roe v.

Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,\" the decision said.\n\nFriday's decision was the second major blow to Iowa abortion protections this month: The Iowa Supreme Court ruled June 17 that the state constitution does not protect a fundamental right to an abortion, overturning its own 2018 precedent.\n\nIn tandem, the two court decisions will make it easier for anti-abortion lawmakers in Iowa to pass new restrictions on the procedure without courts blocking them.\n\nMore:With Roe v. Wade overturned, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds vows to protect 'every unborn Iowan'\n\nIs abortion still legal in Iowa?\n\nYes. Abortion remains legal in Iowa following the U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nSeveral states, including Iowa neighbors South Dakota and Missouri, have passed \"trigger laws\" to immediately ban abortion upon the federal overturn of Roe v. Wade. But with the state Supreme Court's abortion rights precedent still in place when the Iowa legislative session ended May 25, Iowa does not have such a measure.\n\nAbortion is not entirely unrestricted in Iowa. State law forbids abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Patients are required to undergo an ultrasound to determine the gestational age of the fetus before receiving an abortion.\n\nAnd there has been one more change since the June 17 Iowa Supreme Court decision. The court's ruling involved a 2020 Iowa law, set aside during appeal, that requires a 24-hour waiting period for abortions. A Johnson County district court had rejected the waiting period based on the 2018 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that found a fundamental right to abortion in the state constitution. After overturning that precedent June 17, the state Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court for reconsideration, a move that will allow the waiting period requirement to take effect, at least in the short term.\n\nThe Iowa Attorney General's Office has said the waiting period does not kick in until the case formally moves to the lower court from the Supreme Court, 21 days after the ruling. But Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in Iowa, adopted a 24-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and the procedure after the state court decision.\n\nMore:Is there a 24-hour waiting period for abortions in Iowa? Planned Parenthood, ACLU say yes.\n\nWhat happens next for Iowa abortion laws?\n\nThere's one more court decision to watch for this summer, by the district court where the Iowa Supreme Court sent the 24-hour waiting period law for reconsideration.\n\nThe district court, which takes ownership of the case in early July, will determine if the waiting period stays permanently in effect.\n\nWhat is the legal standard that abortion laws must meet in Iowa?\n\nIt's not clear what legal standard Iowa courts will apply when considering whether new restrictions on abortion are constitutional.\n\nFor now, the Iowa Supreme Court has said the \"undue burden\" standard will apply, meaning if an abortion restriction placed a substantial burden on patients, it would be struck down. But the court said June 17 it is open to reconsidering the legal standard in a future case.\n\nLaws that restrict a fundamental right, like freedom of speech or freedom of religion, are held to a higher legal standard in the U.S. than other laws.\n\nSince the 2018 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that found abortion was a fundamental right, abortion laws in Iowa were held to the highest standard. Laws had to withstand \"strict scrutiny,\" meaning any policy restricting abortion had to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. That standard has blocked several restrictive laws from taking effect.\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court overturned the strict scrutiny standard on June 17, but said \"we do not at this time decide what constitutional standard should replace it.\" The standard in Iowa courts does not have to match the federal standard.\n\nFederally, the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey said the \"undue burden\" standard should be used when considering abortion laws.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court overturned Casey in Friday's decision, arguing the undue burden standard was \"unworkable.\"\n\nInstead, the U.S. Supreme Court said restrictions on abortion should be considered using a \"rational basis\" test ‚Äî one of the most permissive judicial standards.\n\n\"A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a 'strong presumption of validity,'\" Friday's decision reads. \"It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests.\"\n\nWill Iowa ban abortion?\n\nRepublicans have been clear they aim to further restrict abortion in Iowa, but their specific plans for future abortion laws are unclear.\n\nRepublican majorities in Iowa have previously passed legislation to require a three-day waiting period and to prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, something that can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nCourts blocked those laws, and they did not take effect.\n\nBut lawmakers may push for similar ‚Äî or more restrictive ‚Äî legislation when they next convene at the Capitol.\n\nCould there be a special session for new Iowa abortion laws?\n\nThe regular session is scheduled to begin in January 2023, but Gov. Kim Reynolds has the power to summon lawmakers back earlier if she chooses.\n\nLawmakers could also call themselves back for a special session with the approval of two-thirds of the members of the Iowa House and Senate, but Republicans lack the votes to do so on their own.\n\nReynolds has previously declined to say whether she would consider calling state lawmakers back to Des Moines for a special legislative session, and she did not immediately say Friday whether she would do so. But she made clear she supports more laws limiting abortion.\n\n\"The fight for life is not over,\" she said. \"As governor, I won‚Äôt rest until every unborn Iowan is protected and respected.\"\n\nMore:'The fight for life is not over': Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa leaders react to Roe v. Wade overturn\n\nLegislative leaders took a similar tack on Friday, praising the court's decision but declining to offer specific plans.\n\n\"As a pro-life caucus, Senate Republicans have led on the protection of life and will continue to do so,\" said Iowa Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny. \"We look forward to continuing to advance the cause of the unborn.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood: 'Our doors are open'\n\nPlanned Parenthood North Central States, which serves several Midwest states, including Iowa, said it will remain open and continue offering services in the wake of the decision.\n\n\"Abortion remains safe and legal in Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska, and today‚Äôs decision will have no impact on patient care in those states,\" the organization said in a statement Friday. \"Our doors remain open.\"\n\nSarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called the Supreme Court's decision \"an unconscionable rollback of fundamental rights.\"\n\nMore:'Our doors remain open' in Iowa, Planned Parenthood says after U.S. Supreme Court abortion decision\n\n\"We have been preparing for months to be able to best serve patients across our region,\" Stoesz said in a statement. \"Our doors are open and Planned Parenthood is committed to providing abortion care where it remains legal.\"\n\nIn North Dakota and South Dakota, Planned Parenthood said trigger laws will soon ban abortion. The group said it has stopped scheduling abortion appointments in South Dakota, although its Sioux Falls health center remains open for birth control, IUDs and other health care services. The organization does not operate a health center in North Dakota.\n\nPolling finds most Iowans believe abortion should remain legal\n\nIn a September 2021 Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, a majority of Iowans, 57%, said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 38% said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. Five percent weren't sure.\n\nBreaking down those results further, 20% of Iowans said abortion should be legal in all cases, while 36% said it should be legal in most cases. Meanwhile, 25% said abortion should be illegal in most cases and 13% said it should be illegal in all cases.\n\nA March 2021 Iowa Poll found fewer than one third of Iowans supported the Legislature's push to amend the Iowa Constitution to say it does not recognize a right to abortion. That poll found 31% in support of the amendment, 58% opposed and 11% not sure.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at kakin@registermedia.com or at 410-340-3440.

It also was one of the most expensive ballot measures in Tennessee history.\n\nIt passed with 53 percent of the vote, but there was a clear urban and rural divide, with Davidson County voters opposing the measure by a 2-to-1 margin, and voters in Shelby, Knox and Hamilton counties voting against the measure.\n\nIts passage has no immediate effect on abortion policies in Tennessee. But it will give lawmakers far more power in enacting abortion regulations and restrictions in Tennessee.\n\nAlready on Tuesday night, at least one newly elected state lawmaker, Sumner County Rep. Courtney Rogers, had pledged to back abortion restrictions when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\nBackers of the amendment were jubilant, embracing at the offices of Tennessee Right to Life, the campaign headquarters for the effort.\n\n\"Obviously for those of us who believe life is sacred, this was the necessary first step toward protection not only for the unborn but for women and girls who fall prey to people looking to profit from untimely or unexpected pregnancies,\" said Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life and a coordinator for the \"Yes on 1\" campaign, who has devoted much of the past 14 years fighting for the measure to get on the ballot.\n\nHarris said his group's next step is returning to the legislature to persuade lawmakers to restore a package of laws stricken by a 2000 state Supreme Court decision, including requiring a short waiting period for women seeking an abortion, a requirement to provide educational materials and greater regulation of abortion facilities.\n\nOpponents on Tuesday night called the measure a \"dangerous ballot measure that strips away the state's established right to safe and legal abortion\" and vowed abortion rights supporters \"will not stand for restrictions that serve only to create barriers to service,\" said Ashley Coffield, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood ‚Äî Greater Memphis Region.\n\nThe abortion measure drew the close attention of national groups on both sides of the abortion divide ‚Äî and large contributions from abortion rights advocates outside the state concerned not only about the impact in Tennessee, but beyond its borders.\n\nOne in four abortions in Tennessee is sought by a woman from out of state. Proponents of the measure called on Tennessee voters to end the state's status as an \"abortion destination.\"\n\nOpponents of the measure said Tennessee, bordered by eight states, has long been a destination for quality health care. Abortion restrictions in surrounding states have made the South increasingly hostile to abortion rights, prompting women in neighboring states to travel here for the procedure.\n\nTennessee was one of three states with abortion measures on the ballot Tuesday. Voters in North Dakota and Colorado rejected so-called \"personhood\" measures that would have broadened the definition of persons to include fetuses.\n\nThe Tennessee measure will add this language to the state constitution once the votes are certified:\n\n\"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother.\"\n\nThe campaign has proved to be the most expensive referendum ballot in recent years. The \"Yes on 1\" and the \"Vote No on 1\" campaigns raised more than $5 million combined, spending most of it in a barrage of television and radio ads in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nIn the first three weeks of October alone, the \"No\" campaign spent more than $3.4 million on its efforts to defeat the measure. Most of the contributions came from Planned Parenthood affiliates in Tennessee and other states, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union. The two groups are the primary organizers of the \"No\" campaign.\n\nThe \"Yes\" campaign spent more than $1 million in October, almost entirely on campaign advertizing ‚Äî thanks in part to raising $670,000 in the first three weeks of the month. The majority of \"Yes\" campaign contributors were individuals, with churches and abortion opponent groups making contributions as well. Tennessee Right to Life was the primary organizer of the \"Yes\" campaign.\n\nWith Amendment 1's passage, Tennessee becomes the fourth state to explicitly amend its constitution on the issue of abortion.

Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger Tudor Dixon clashed on abortion rights in a debate Tuesday night, as Whitmer backed a referendum on ballots this fall that would amend the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights.\n\nDixon said that referendum, if approved by voters, ‚Äúwould be the most radical abortion law in the entire country. The only place that has something similar is China and North Korea.‚Äù\n\nWhitmer shot back: ‚ÄúNone of what she said is true.‚Äù\n\nThe two were clashing over what‚Äôs known as Proposal 3 ‚Äì a measure placed on the ballot after a petition drive seeking to amend the state‚Äôs constitution to scrap Michigan‚Äôs 1931 law banning abortion with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. That law, which had long been dormant, was revived after the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision overturning Roe v. Wade before a judge ruled the law unconstitutional in September.\n\nTuesday‚Äôs debate was the second between Whitmer and Dixon, with voting already underway in the key swing state two weeks from Election Day.\n\nA CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Monday showed Whitmer leading Dixon among likely voters, 52% to 46%. Voters are 6 percentage points likelier to view Whitmer favorably than unfavorably, while Dixon‚Äôs rating is underwater by 10 points.\n\nWhitmer‚Äôs campaign has focused largely on her support for abortion rights. In the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, Whitmer sued to block the enforcement of the state‚Äôs 1931 abortion ban, and she has backed Proposal 3.\n\nDixon, a conservative commentator who is backed by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos‚Äô family and won the GOP nomination after an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, has criticized Whitmer‚Äôs pandemic policies. She has also leaned into cultural battles, proposing a policy that would ban transgender girls from competing in sports with the gender they identify with, as well as one modeled after the controversial measure Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law earlier this year, which critics dubbed the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù law.\n\nHere are four takeaways from their debate:\n\nClash over abortion ballot measure\n\nTheir exchange over Proposal 3 underscored the drastically diverging views of what the ballot measure would do if approved by voters. Supporters have said it would not invalidate existing laws, including parental consent requirements. Opponents say it would nullify virtually all existing guardrails.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Republican candidate Tudor Dixon shake hands before their debate at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, October 25, 2022. Robin Buckson/Detroit News/Pool/AP\n\n‚ÄúWe know that Proposal 3 does remove parental consent. It also makes it so you don‚Äôt have to be a doctor to perform an abortion,‚Äù Dixon said.\n\nShe argued that if approved, the ballot measure would allow for abortions ‚Äúup to the moment of birth, for any reason, including sex selection.‚Äù\n\nThe Democratic governor said Michigan‚Äôs laws regulating abortion rights that existed prior to Roe v. Wade‚Äôs reversal would remain in place. She also pointed to Dixon‚Äôs comments opposing abortion rights in cases of rape and incest.\n\n‚ÄúYou cannot trust her on this issue. If you want to protect Roe v. Wade rights, vote yes on 3,‚Äù Whitmer said.\n\nThe exchange showcased Dixon‚Äôs shifting approach to the issue, as she seeks to motivate conservative voters. Dixon had previously downplayed the role of the governor in the abortion battle, arguing that the issue‚Äôs outcome will be settled by voters and that those voters could cast their ballots to guarantee abortion rights and back Dixon at the same time.\n\nShe said Tuesday night that she would accept voters‚Äô will if they approve Proposal 3.\n\n‚ÄúThe people will decide what they want to do on abortion rights in the state of Michigan,‚Äù Dixon said.\n\n‚ÄòElection denier‚Äô\n\nWhitmer and Dixon each took shots at each other over past election results, but did not dive in any detail into the issue of how elections are managed in one of the most important presidential battleground states.\n\nThe Democratic governor hit her Republican challenger first, noting that she has at times embraced false theories about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n‚ÄúShe refuses to accept the outcome of the last election,‚Äù Whitmer said. ‚ÄúShe is an election denier and never, ever has said that Joe Biden won this last election.‚Äù\n\nDixon responded with a criticism of Whitmer‚Äôs lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist, citing his complaints about Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey in 2017, when Gilchrist ran against Winfrey for the post managing the city‚Äôs elections and narrowly lost.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering if she‚Äôs going to say that she can no longer run with an election denier,‚Äù Dixon said.\n\nIt‚Äôs a strategy Republicans have used increasingly in recent weeks, responding to Democratic criticism that they have parroted Trump‚Äôs election lies by pointing to examples of Democratic politicians, such as Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams, rejecting the outcomes of past elections.\n\nUltimately, the two talked past each other: Neither engaged with the other‚Äôs criticism, and moderators did not return to the issue.\n\nSchool safety\n\nThe two clashed over how to protect children from school shootings, with Dixon arguing for more security at school buildings and Whitmer making the case for gun control measures.\n\nDixon said she wants armed security at schools, as well as a single entry point for school buildings.\n\n‚ÄúWe need an Office of Safe Schools, like states like Florida have, to make sure that this is a top priority,‚Äù Dixon said.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying that for 30 years. It‚Äôs not working,‚Äù Whitmer said.\n\nInstead, she said, Michigan needs to enact laws requiring background checks and secure storage, as well as ‚Äúred flag‚Äù laws.\n\n‚ÄúAsk yourself, who is going to keep your kids safe: The former prosecutor with plans, or a candidate with thoughts and prayers?‚Äù Whitmer said.\n\nBook bans\n\nDixon sought to go on offense over local debates around what books are allowed in school libraries, saying that ‚Äúparents are outraged‚Äù over what she characterized as ‚Äúbooks describing how to have sex.‚Äù\n\nMore on governor's races How a Trump favorite is already tainting a new election with his playbook Kari Lake doesn‚Äôt commit to accepting Arizona election result if she loses Independent candidate upends Oregon race for governor and gives GOP an opening 6 takeaways from the Wisconsin governor‚Äôs debate between Tony Evers and Tim Michels More on the midterms\n\n‚ÄúIf you have material in your school that is something you can‚Äôt read to a child at a bus stop because you would be arrested because it is pornographic, then it should not be in a classroom,‚Äù Dixon said.\n\nWhitmer responded that Dixon was trying to ‚Äúwedge communities against each other.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is dangerous and it is selfish,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe need to bring down the temperature and solve the problem to make sure parents are involved and students feel comfortable and we‚Äôre giving them a robust education.‚Äù\n\nDixon responded: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received the answer now that she‚Äôs not going to stand with parents on this issue.‚Äù\n\nAnd Whitmer shot back: ‚ÄúDo you really think books are more dangerous than guns?

The company said it wasn‚Äôt aware of any consumer complaints or reports of illness related to the recall.\n\nThe 22-page FDA inspection report, acquired by CNN on Tuesday, describes a dirty, rat-infested facility where merchandise including human and animal food was stored. The inspectors note that they observed ‚Äúrodent evidence, including live rodents, dead rodents of various states of decay, rodent excreta pellets ‚Ä¶ gnawings, nesting, and odors indicative of rodents throughout the entirety‚Äù of the facility.\n\nThe FDA report says Family Dollar has been aware of the rodent problem since at least January 2020. The general manager told inspectors that when there was a fire drill in October, ‚Äúdozens of rats could be seen running around the facility due to the loud and sustained sound of the fire alarm,‚Äù the report said. Because the stench from the rodents was so bad in one part of the facility, the company even stopped using a breakroom and an inventory control center, the report said.\n\nFamily Dollar spokesperson Kayleigh Campbell told CNN in an email that the company temporarily closed the affected stores. ‚Äúin order to proficiently conduct the voluntary recall of certain FDA-regulated products.

Mayne, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), said in a statement.\n\n‚ÄúThe FDA‚Äôs goal is to support innovation in food technologies while always maintaining as our first priority the safety of the foods available to U.S. consumers,‚Äù the statement added.\n\nUpside Foods founder and CEO Uma Valeti said on Twitter that its cultivated chicken ‚Äúwas one step closer to being on tables everywhere.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUPSIDE has received our ‚ÄòNo Questions Letter‚Äô from the FDA,‚Äù Valeti tweeted. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve accepted our conclusion that our cultivated chicken is safe to eat.‚Äù\n\nHe told CNN earlier this year that the process of making cultivated meat was ‚Äúsimilar to brewing beer, but instead of growing yeast or microbes, we grow animal cells.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThese products are not vegan, vegetarian or plant-based ‚Äì they are real meat, made without the animal.‚Äù\n\nSingapore was the first country to allow the sale of cultured meat. It granted San Francisco start-up Eat Just Inc. regulatory approval in 2020 to sell its laboratory-grown chicken in Singapore.\n\nAdvocates hope that cultured meat will reduce the need to slaughter animals for food and help with the climate crisis. The food system is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, most of which are from animal agriculture.\n\n‚ÄúWe are thrilled at FDA‚Äôs historic announcement that, after a rigorous evaluation, UPSIDE Foods has become the first company in the world to receive the US FDA greenlight for cultivated chicken,‚Äù David Kay, director of communications at Upside Foods, said via email.\n\n‚ÄúAt scale, cultivated meat is projected to use substantially less water and land than conventionally-produced meat.‚Äù\n\nAlthough not technically an approval, the FDA said that a thorough pre-market consultation process had been completed. The clearance only applies to food made from cultured chicken cells by Upside, but the statement said the FDA ‚Äúis ready to work with additional firms developing cultured animal cell food.‚Äù", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/04/21/cheese-bandits-still-unresolved/100746170/", "title": "'Organized' cheese bandits still on the loose", "text": "John Ferak\n\nThe (Appleton, Wis.)

The Oak Creek, Wis., business seemed a safe place to temporarily leave his trailer while he got his truck serviced. The property had video surveillance and a chain-link fence. The truck had been traveling from Green Bay to the Milwaukee area.\n\nBut by 2 a.m., when the driver returned, his trailer was gone. Someone made off with $46,000 worth of stolen cheese.\n\nWhere did the cheese go? Where did the semitrailer wind up? Just who was the cheese bandit?

That pair of crimes occurred in January 2016, about a week apart. Both of those loads were recovered. The Marshfield shipment of cheese turned up about two weeks later at a storage warehouse near Appleton, about 105 miles southeast. The trailer of cheese from Germantown turned up at a grocery store lot in Milwaukee, about 25 miles southeast.\n\n\"It's an organized type of crime,\" said Marshfield Police Lt. Darren Larson. \"It's certainly very plausible because of the sophisticated nature of these crimes that you need knowledge of the (freight) shipping business.\"\n\nProfiling a cheese thief\n\nWhy would someone steal a truck stocked with thousands of pounds of yellow cheddar? Police and industry experts say it's all about resale value. The cheese from Marshfield had an estimated retail value of $90,000.

Even in Wisconsin, you can't exactly go door to door with this stuff.\n\nUnless your plan is to eat all the cheese, stealing a full cheese truck might be more trouble than it's worth.\n\n\"The harder part is figuring out what to do with it,\" agreed John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association.\n\nOne of the transportation industry's leading experts on cargo crimes said most thieves have already lined up a buyer before they steal a 53-foot semitrailer stocked with food or other merchandise.\n\n\"Food products are a bigger target than most people think; food gets stolen all the time,\" said J.J. Coughlin, author of the 2012 book, Cargo Crime: Security and Theft Prevention.\n\n\"You are dealing with people who are organized and true criminals,\" Coughlin said last week. \"It's not mafia like you think, but it's very organized. It can be a ring or it can be one person, but it's usually a ring of two or three people.\"\n\nSomeone stealing a truck of cheese usually intends to sell off the product to a small mom-and-pop grocer or restaurant, Coughlin said.\n\nRelated: U.S. government to buy $20 million of glorious cheddar cheese\n\nHe recalled a crime he investigated years ago in Texas involving a stolen meat truck. It was a back-alley deal. The thieves sold off the stolen meat for a flat $10,000 to a man who owned a chain of seven restaurants. \"The person buying meat off the street, he's just looking for the best deal,\" Coughlin said.\n\nHowever, now more than ever, it's increasingly difficult for black market smugglers to unload thousands of pounds of fresh cheese because the food regulatory industry has become wiser. Coughlin said it's inconceivable that a grocery store chain would buy a truck of cheese from someone pulling into their loading dock, offering a discount deal.\n\nPackaged cheese is bar-coded with a \"traceable trail\" to track the history of the food-processing origin, Umhoefer said.\n\nThat means it's practically impossible to sell a truck of stolen cheese to a reputable grocery chain.\n\nFortunately for Wisconsin, the state is not regarded as a hot-spot for cargo thefts, Coughlin said. Most cargo thieves operate in the South, where there are more mom-and-pop restaurants, convenient stores and grocers. Smaller stores that aren't part of a national or regional retail chain often struggle to remain profitable. As such, there's a greater temptation for some of these little businesses to buy stolen merchandise by the bulk at a deep discount.\n\nAlthough large-volume cheese heists are rare, they have happened before in Wisconsin. In 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on four thieves who were charged with stealing quite a few semitrailers over several months. The stolen merchandise ranged from Nike sneakers to a tractor trailer filled with mozzarella cheese.\n\nNo suspect in mind\n\nIt's now been 10 months since Wisconsin's last great cheese truck heist, in Oak Creek. That crime and the two earlier cheese heists from January 2016 have netted no arrests.\n\n\"There were leads available, and we followed up on a possible suspect,\" said Marshfield police's Larson. \"Unfortunately, it did not turn out. Right now, we don't have a specific suspect in mind.\"\n\nEven though the cheese was recovered by police from the two crimes in January 2016, the damage was done. \"I believe that was all destroyed,\" Larson said. \"They could not verify that any of the stolen cheese was properly stored.\"\n\nWhether the three Wisconsin crimes were carried out by three different perpetrators \"it's hard to say,\" Coughlin said.\n\n\"Food gets stolen all the time,\" he said. \"They're probably not going to get caught, if they have not been busted by now.\"\n\nThe best hope for police in Wisconsin is that their cheese bandits were part of an elaborate ring.\n\n\"People talk,\" Coughlin said. \"The more people involved, the more of an opportunity for information slipping out.\"\n\nFollow John Ferak on Twitter: @johnferak", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/investing/plant-based-foods-beyond-meat/index.html", "title": "Is Beyond Meat beyond saving? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nHaving an executive allegedly bite someone‚Äôs nose might be the least of Beyond Meat‚Äôs problems. Investors have taken a big chomp out of Beyond Meat‚Äôs stock price as fears grow that the popularity of plant-based food may have reached a peak.\n\nShares of Beyond Meat (BYND) were around $16 Wednesday. That‚Äôs down more than 75% this year, near an all-time low, and well below its peak price of near $235 in 2019 shortly after the company went public.\n\nSo is the plant-based food craze a fad that‚Äôs already over? Not exactly. Companies like Beyond Meat, rival Impossible and plant-based milk producer Oatly are still doing big deals with supermarket chains and restaurants to get their products on store shelves and menus.\n\nBeyond Meat recently announced a recent partnership with Taco Bell. The Yum! (YUM) Brands-owned Mexican fast food chain will be selling quesadillas featuring Beyond‚Äôs plant-based carne asada steak.\n\nBut in the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call, Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown conceded that the company (and the industry) faces challenges.\n\nInflation is a problem for plant-based food biz too\n\n‚ÄúWe went from a pandemic into record inflation,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúAnd for a sector that‚Äôs still gathering its feet and is still in sort of the first set of downs, that‚Äôs a very difficult set of conditions to navigate.‚Äù\n\nBrown conceded that ‚Äúprogress for us and for the sector is taking longer than expected.‚Äù Making matters more difficult for the company ‚Äì Beyond Meat‚Äôs products tend to cost more at the grocery store than real, animal-based meat.\n\nThat‚Äôs why Brown said inflation will add more ‚Äúpressure on consumer spending and specifically how this impacts higher-cost proteins and foods.‚Äù As such, he‚Äôs expecting ‚Äúa delay in post-Covid resumption of growth.‚Äù\n\nOatly, which went public at a price of $17 in the summer of $21 and quickly surged to a peak of nearly $30, is also struggling as inflation concerns and supply chain woes present big problems. Shares have plummeted 66% this year and now trade below $3.\n\n‚ÄúWe see tremendous challenges for retailers here to just navigate around this unprecedented change that is happening and also the consumers who are really monitoring their household budget,‚Äù said Oatly CEO Toni Petersson on the company‚Äôs latest earnings conference call last month.\n\nThese economic headwinds are likely to prompt Impossible Foods, which had been expected to go public sometime this year, to delay an initial public offering. Impossible was valued at $7 billion based on its most recent round of fundraising late last year. That was before the market imploded.\n\nOf course, Beyond Meat and Impossible also face the challenge of competing with established food giants such as Kellogg (K), ConAgra (CAG) and Campbell Soup (CPB), which have also entered the plant-based market.\n\nPerception that plants are ‚Äòwoke‚Äô could limit sales\n\nCompanies in the plant-based food world face another more daunting challenge besides broader economic woes and new rivals: It may be tougher to convince consumers to switch to plant-based burgers or milk.\n\n‚ÄúAfter years of growth, plant-based meat sales in the United States are stagnating,‚Äù said consulting firm Deloitte in a recent report. ‚ÄúThe addressable market may be more limited than many thought.‚Äù\n\nDeloitte suggested that ‚Äúthe portion of the US population open to trying and repeat buying‚Äù plant-based proteins ‚Äúmay already have reached a saturation point.‚Äù\n\nPlant-based companies may also face the problem of being viewed as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù in a highly polarized America.\n\nDeloitte said in its report that customers who are not buying (or even trying) plant-based foods ‚Äúmay not be easily reachable, partly due to cultural resistance.‚Äù\n\nTake, for example, the social media outcry last month when Cracker Barrel (CBRL) announced it was adding Impossible‚Äôs sausage to its breakfast menu.\n\nSo there is nothing fake about Wall Street‚Äôs concerns regarding the big drop in demand for ‚Äúfake‚Äù meat and milk.", "authors": ["Paul R.

The federal government has been pouring money into rural broadband of late.\n\nThe USDA is doling out $600 million in ReConnect grants and loans to support the expansion of broadband into rural areas. In December, the USDA announced a second $550 million round of ReConnect funding, for which it will begin accepting applications Friday.\n\nThe FCC also has said it would give providers $20.4 billion over the next decade to connect some 4 million rural homes and businesses to high-speed internet.\n\nRecently:Gov.

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine‚Äôs government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n‚ÄúWe are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,‚Äù SpaceX‚Äôs director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military‚Äôs commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, ‚ÄúSpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.‚Äù\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX‚Äôs own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk‚Äôs Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: ‚ÄúF*** off.‚Äù\n\nUkraine‚Äôs ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk‚Äôs claimed peace plan for Russia‚Äôs Ukraine war by saying: ‚ÄúF*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just following his recommendation,‚Äù Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN‚Äôs reporting and Melnyk‚Äôs comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. ‚ÄúThat has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,‚Äù said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. ‚ÄúStarlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.‚Äù\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn‚Äôt dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX‚Äôs suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk‚Äôs allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he ‚Äústill very much support[s] Ukraine‚Äù but fears ‚Äúmassive escalation.‚Äù\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn‚Äôt want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, ‚ÄúRussia would accept those terms,‚Äù according to a person who heard them.\n\n‚ÄúUkraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,‚Äù the person familiar with the discussions said. ‚ÄúThe decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That‚Äôs Elon Musk. He hasn‚Äôt been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.‚Äù\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine‚Äôs infrastructure, Musk replied: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe gall to look like heroes‚Äù\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it‚Äôs hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It‚Äôs not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‚ÄúStarlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,‚Äù said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. ‚ÄúWithout that they‚Äôd be really operating in the blind in many cases.‚Äù\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX‚Äôs request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has ‚Äúthe gall to look like heroes‚Äù while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid ‚Äì or partially paid ‚Äì for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine‚Äôs commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units‚Äô ‚Äúexceptional utility‚Äù and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine‚Äôs new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, ‚ÄúThe Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces as they repel Russia‚Äôs brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.‚Äù\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level ‚Äì $4,500 a month ‚Äì to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink‚Äôs website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat‚Äôs just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n‚ÄúYou could say he‚Äôs trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be part of this anymore,‚Äô‚Äù said the person familiar with Ukraine‚Äôs requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk‚Äôs reputation for being unpredictable, ‚ÄúFeelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,‚Äù this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter ‚Äì including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ‚Äì after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he‚Äôd made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called ‚ÄúThe Weekend,‚Äù at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they‚Äôve had recent victories.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the time to do it. They don‚Äôt want to do it, that‚Äôs for sure. But this is the time to do it,‚Äù he said, according to a person in the room. ‚ÄúEveryone wants to seek peace when they‚Äôre losing but they don‚Äôt want to seek peace when they‚Äôre winning.

The New York Times reported at the time that ‚Äúfrom 180 to 450 people, and possibly more,‚Äù were killed during four days of violence, with thousands more wounded and detained, much of it while the country was plunged into digital darkness. Reuters, in December 2019, reported 1,500 people were killed during a two-week span of unrest.\n\nNow, some worry history could repeat itself amid renewed civil unrest. Protestors have flooded the streets in recent days after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died while in custody of Tehran‚Äôs morality police. Iranian officials claimed she had a heart attack, but her family has said she had no preexisting heart condition. ‚ÄúI have no idea what they did to her,‚Äù her father, Amjad Amini, told BBC Persia. ‚ÄúEverything is a lie.‚Äù\n\nMobile networks have been largely shut down, according to internet watchdog Netblocks. And Meta has confirmed that Iranians are having trouble accessing some of its apps, including WhatsApp and Instagram. While it is not the total internet shutdown of 2019, tech experts say they are seeing a similar pattern.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that would make us think that this is accidental,‚Äù said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at network intelligence company Kentik, Inc. ‚ÄúMy understanding given the context is the objective was to stop people from sharing videos and communicating with the outside world.‚Äù\n\nAlp Toker, the director of Netblocks, said ‚Äúthe impacts of these disruptions can‚Äôt be overstated.‚Äù Earlier this week, Netblocks said the Iranian people are now subject to ‚Äúthe most severe internet restrictions since the November 2019 massacre.‚Äù\n\nPeople protest against increased gas price, on a highway in Tehran, Iran November 16, 2019. Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA/Reuters/File\n\nThe loss of internet connectivity has become a ‚Äúcentral fear that‚Äôs etched into the minds of Iranians, particularly post-2019,‚Äù Toker said. ‚ÄúOne of the most alarming things about the information blackout is that we don‚Äôt even have a precise death toll,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBecause what happens, in terms of human rights violations, abuses of power become much more difficult to document, collate and record.‚Äù\n\nHuman rights groups say at least eight people have been killed in the demonstrations so far, and are calling on the international community ‚Äî and the tech sector, especially ‚Äî to do more to support the Iranian people. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday announced steps the US government was taking to clear some sanctions-related red tape and allow American tech firms to help the people of Iran access digital tools.\n\n‚Äú(W)e are going to help make sure the Iranian people are not kept isolated and in the dark,‚Äù Blinken said. ‚ÄúThis is a concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected.‚Äù\n\nTime may be of the essence. While the current internet blackout is ‚Äúnot as severe as November 2019,‚Äù Madory said, there are concerns it could eventually be. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early on ‚Äî it‚Äôs too early to know if this is going to be surpassed or not.‚Äù\n\nWidespread scale of blackouts leave few options to circumvent\n\nAmir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the human rights organization Miaan Group, operates a resource center to help those in Iran deal with internet shutdowns. Rashidi, a software developer who fled Iran more than a decade ago, said he and his team help provide Iranians inside the country with tech tools, risk analysis guidance and trainings so that they can stay connected with each other even when the internet is severed by the government.\n\nHe believes Iranian officials are currently following a familiar playbook. ‚ÄúFirst,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey shut down the mobile data, and this is sophisticated enough to shut down even in a particular neighborhood.‚Äù If the protests continue to grow, he said, ‚Äúthen they start to expand internet shut down, step by step.‚Äù Eventually, he said, ‚Äúthey go full shutdown and shut down everything.‚Äù\n\nBut even as it stands now, the options to get around the internet service blackouts are limited.\n\nDozens of people stage a demonstration to protest the death of a 22-year-old woman under custody in Tehran Iran on September 21, 2022.

On Thursday, KentuckyWired said it had installed 1,090 miles, but none of it is functional.\n\nAnd what was originally supposed to cost taxpayers $30 million could leave them on the hook for as much as $1.5 billion, according to a scathing review of the project state Auditor Mike Harmon released in September.\n\nHarmon was on hand Thursday to reiterate his opinion that the best of the state‚Äôs \"bad options\" would be to shutter the project and fund only the payments on the more than $300 million in bonds issued for it.\n\nAlso invited to address the budget committee was Andrew McNeill, a representative from Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group funded by billionaires Charles and David Koch. He called the project an \"unmitigated disaster.\"\n\nKentucky's 2015 public-private partnership deal with Australia's Macquarie Group to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the KentuckyWired broadband system was almost immediately changed to shift massive costs and risk to the state, Harmon's September report said.\n\nRelatively brief delays ‚Äî for example, in obtaining the rights to string fiber-optic cable from utility poles often owned by KentuckyWired's for-profit competitors AT&T and Windstream ‚Äî became the fault of the state and cost it dearly.\n\nConsider this:After Google Fiber breakup, Louisville woos Indiana internet company\n\nKentuckyWired is still completing a $93 million settlement with private contractors over those delays. Last year, lawmakers reluctantly granted KentuckyWired the ability to borrow $110 million for the settlement agreement and future loss claims.\n\nBut last year's hurried legislation failed to account for the additional costs of borrowing that $110 million, said Scott Brinkman, secretary of the governor‚Äôs cabinet and chairman of the public authority charged with overseeing KentuckyWired.\n\nSo House Bill 509 would give the project a ceiling of $20 million to cover the additional costs. Those include the cost of hiring underwriter JPMorgan and financial adviser Commonwealth Economics as well as the sometimes sizable reserve funds that bondholders typically require of projects not undergirded by more tangible assets.\n\nWhen finished, KentuckyWired will only serve government buildings, not individual residences or businesses.\n\nInstead, the \"middle mile\" fiber optic network plans to sell connections to internet service providers looking to provide \"last mile\" access. The state auditor has described much of the revenue expected to be generated from the sale of middle mile connection as \"speculative.\"\n\nRead this:As Google Fiber pulls the plug, Louisville is the jilted suitor\n\nBut Brinkman and Kentucky Communications Network Authority Executive Director Phillip Brown fended off attacks from lawmakers Thursday by pointing to the hundreds of millions of dollars it would cost to terminate the deal with Macquarie and its partners prematurely.\n\nKentuckyWired, they said, is finally gaining momentum and generating inquiries from last mile providers hoping to tap into the network.\n\n\"We're on the cusp ‚Äî the eve, literally ‚Äî of this project being completed and starting to produce revenues and we're having a discussion about terminating this project? It makes no sense, financial or otherwise. It makes no sense,‚Äù Brinkman told committee members.\n\nAt the urging of the governor‚Äôs office, Senate Bill 253 ultimately was not put to a vote in committee Thursday, though McDaniel told reporters after the meeting he still has the votes to stop KentuckyWired both in committee and in the General Assembly.\n\n\"It's absolutely not dead,\" McDaniel said of his bid to shutter KentuckyWired.\n\nReach reporter Alfred Miller at amiller@gannett.com or 502-582-7142.

The letter requested that the Defense Department take over more of the funding for Ukraine‚Äôs military, which it calculated would run tens of millions of dollars a month.\n\nDays after the CNN report, Musk appeared to reverse course, claiming that SpaceX had withdrawn the request.\n\n‚ÄúThe hell with it,‚Äù Musk tweeted, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.‚Äù\n\nNegotiations between SpaceX and the Defense Department continue despite Musk‚Äôs claim that SpaceX withdrepw its request, according to a senior defense official.\n\n‚ÄúNegotiations are very much underway.

Musk has also been embroiled in his high-profile and controversial takeover of Twitter.\n\nNeither Musk nor SpaceX responded to a request for comment. The Ukrainian government, including the Ministry of Defense, did not immediately respond.\n\nThe recent outage started on October 24 and was described by one person briefed on the situation as a ‚Äúhuge problem‚Äù for Ukraine‚Äôs military. The terminals had been disconnected, this person said, due to a lack of funding.\n\nThe outage affected a block of 1,300 terminals that Ukraine purchased from a British company in March and were used for combat-related operations.\n\nSpaceX was charging Ukraine‚Äôs military $2,500 a month to keep each of the 1,300 units connected, pushing the total cost to almost $20 million by September, the person briefed on the matter said. Eventually, they could no longer afford to pay, the person said.\n\nA British request\n\nBefore the terminals went completely dark, Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Defense made a request in early October to their British counterparts to pick up the $3.25 million monthly bill. The batch of terminals were also rotated out as concerns grew that service could be turned off, in order to minimize the impact, the source said.\n\nA British official said after discussions between the ministries ‚Äúit was agreed there were higher priority military capabilities.‚Äù Among many other channels of support, the UK has been flying thousands of Ukrainian troops to Britain for training before they head back to the frontlines.\n\n‚ÄúWe support a number of terminals that have a direct tactical utility for Ukraine‚Äôs military in repelling Russia‚Äôs invasion,‚Äù the British official told CNN. ‚ÄúWe consider and prioritize all new requests in terms of the impact contributions would have in supporting Ukraine to defend its people against Putin‚Äôs deplorable invasion.‚Äù\n\nA senior Ukrainian official confirmed the outage, calling the Starlink units ‚Äúvery important‚Äù for Ukraine‚Äôs fight against Russia.\n\nThe September letter from SpaceX to the Pentagon said there were almost 20,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine. At that time, by SpaceX‚Äôs own admission, the majority of them were fully or partially purchased with outside funding, including from the US, Polish and UK governments. The letter claimed those sources paid for about 30% of the monthly connectivity bill as well.\n\nThe terminals, which include small satellite dishes, connect to SpaceX‚Äôs constellation of satellites orbiting the earth and not only keep troops and civilians online but have been used with lethal effect, proving critical for Ukraine‚Äôs use of drones and artillery targeting.\n\nIt‚Äôs unclear exactly how many terminals Ukraine‚Äôs military is operating but the 1,300 that recently shut off represent a significant portion. In July the country‚Äôs commander-in-chief wrote Musk directly asking for more, in a letter seen by CNN, saying approximately 4,000 had been deployed by the military.\n\nA woman rides a bicycle past a damaged building in the town of Kupiansk on November 3, 2022, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It's responsible for many of the nation's most popular and richest lotteries, including Powerball and Hot Lotto.\n\nTipton had pleaded guilty in 1982 for his part in a warehouse burglary. The then 19-year-old faced up to 20 years in prison for the felony conviction, but instead was given two years of probation and was ordered to pay $1,719 in restitution, court records show.\n\nAnd before his burglary conviction, Tipton had been convicted of stealing computer software from a department store. Tipton told federal investigators more than 20 years later that the software theft was a ‚ÄúJerry Springer-style‚Äù incident that was ‚Äúmore of an argument with a Sears employee.‚Äù\n\nIn 2003, as he sat for an interview, Tipton told Ed Stefan, his prospective boss at the Multi-State Lottery Association, about both convictions. So he was surprised when the association paid to fly him from Texas to Des Moines for an in-person job interview.\n\nWhy lottery association executives overlooked Tipton‚Äôs criminal convictions isn't entirely clear. MUSL knew about the burglary when Tipton was hired, according to court documents.\n\nState law prohibits felons working for the Iowa Lottery. But that law does not apply to MUSL employees.\n\nBret Tyone, CEO of the Multi-State Lottery Association, said he couldn't comment or provide a copy of the association's employee code of conduct, citing ongoing litigation. Stefan did not return calls for comment.\n\nBut former deputy Iowa Attorney General Thomas H. Miller made it clear in an interview this year that he believes Tipton should never have been given the opportunity to land a job where he would design the software that randomly picked the winning numbers for the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\n\"A thief is a thief,‚Äù Miller told Game Show Network.\n\nA Bigfoot hunt, a lottery win and a duped FBI\n\nTipton‚Äôs initial late-night sticky note session resulted in his scam‚Äôs first win ‚Äî a Nov. 23, 2005, drawing in Colorado.\n\nThe stars aligned for that game: It was a major jackpot ‚Äî $4.8 million ‚Äî and it landed on one of the three dates during the year that he was able to manipulate with his secret code.\n\nThe opportunity was especially convenient because of his brother‚Äôs hunt for Bigfoot.\n\nTommy Tipton‚Äôs fascination with folklore surrounding the ape-like creature began as a child, when his grandmother retold stories about a critter that would spook their farm animals in Arkansas.\n\nAnd it just so happened that Tommy‚Äôs pursuit of Bigfoot was taking him to Colorado in November 2005.\n\nEddie, who said few people possessed the \"geekiness\" necessary to understand his work, seized the opportunity to try out his rigged coding.\n\n‚ÄúMy brother was going on a trip, and I suggested that I had some numbers that he could play,\" he told investigators. \"And that was pretty much it.\"\n\nBut the story, according to his brother, was far more nuanced.\n\nTommy, who by 2005 was a magistrate in Fayette County, Texas, was skeptical whether it was legal for him to play the hundreds of sets of numbers given him by his brother, an employee of the lottery association.\n\nTommy told investigators he contacted a friend, Texas defense attorney Luis Vallejo, to consult about the matter. Vallejo could find no reason that it would be illegal for him to play, even though Eddie worked for the lottery association, Tommy said.\n\nAfter the winning numbers were drawn Nov. 23, 2005, three people came forward to claim the $4.8 million prize: a Colorado resident not linked to the conspiracy; Alexander Hicks, a friend of Tommy‚Äôs whom he had recruited to cash the ticket; and Texas lawyer Thad Whisenant, who had created a Nevada limited liability-corporation called Cuestion de Suerte (Question of Luck).\n\nThe Colorado resident‚Äôs claim came from an ‚Äúeasy pick‚Äù ticket, meaning the numbers were selected by a machine. Investigators ruled that purchase legitimate.\n\nBut the others drew their suspicion. Whisenant and Vallejo were publicly named by investigators, who in August 2016 asked the public for assistance in the case.\n\nThey were never arrested.\n\nWhom can you trust?\n\nTommy told investigators during his June 29, 2017, deposition that he believed Vallejo somehow stole the numbers he had been given by his brother, although Tommy said he never directly confronted him about it.\n\nHicks ‚Äî who was never charged with a crime ‚Äî gave 90% of the nearly $570,000 cash-option prize payout from the jackpot to Tommy. Cuestion de Suerte collected the same amount.\n\nNeither Vallejo nor Whisenant returned calls for this article. Whisenant was never asked to return the money he collected.\n\nTommy remains bitter about the outcome.\n\n‚ÄúIt was a big shock to me to hear that an attorney whom I went to for advice played the lottery,\" he said of Vallejo.\n\nSoon after the 2005 win, Tommy fell from a 31-foot tree stand while Bigfoot hunting and ‚Äúalmost died,‚Äù he told investigators. He was in the hospital in 2006 when the FBI questioned him about why he was trying to exchange $450,000 in consecutively marked bills.\n\nTommy truthfully told the agents the money came from the 2005 Colorado lottery win. But he told them he was trying to exchange the bills because he couldn‚Äôt tell his wife of the win since gambling was contrary to her Christian faith.\n\nIn neither the first nor a subsequent interview did the FBI ask about the work his brother was doing for the Multi-State Lottery Association ‚Äî and Tommy never volunteered the information.\n\nEventually, the FBI dropped its inquiry, and the Tiptons resumed their lottery scheme.\n\nFrustrated Eddie warns his bosses\n\nAs the head of the Multi-State Lottery Association's IT security, Eddie Tipton was making almost $100,000 a year. But he felt underappreciated and overworked at the time he wrote the code to hack into the national lottery system.\n\nHe was working 50- to 60-hour weeks and often was in the office until 11 p.m. His managers expected him to take on far more roles than were practical, he complained.\n\n\"I wrote software. I worked on Web pages. I did network security. I did firewalls,\" he said in his confession. \"And then I did my regular auditing job on top of all that. They just found no limits to what they wanted to make me do. It even got to the point where the word ‚Äòslave‚Äô was used.\"\n\nNobody at the Multi-State Lottery Association oversaw his complete body of work, and few people truly cared about security, he said. That lack of oversight allowed Tipton to write, install and use his secret code without discovery.\n\nTipton said he even warned lottery officials about the system's security risks and alerted them in 2006 about an error in the random-drawing software after the same numbers were drawn in the same order in the same year in a Wisconsin game.\n\nSoon after his first successful lottery scam, Eddie said he offered a fix that would have thwarted his ability to predict winning numbers ‚Äî appointing a second person to oversee some of the most crucial processes of the random-generator software.\n\nHis immediate boss, Stefan, took the concerns seriously, he said, but others in the organization did not. Most of his concerns were dismissed or inadequately addressed, Tipton complained.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd do reviews and I‚Äôd find stuff ‚Äî gaping holes in their procedures ‚Äî and I would tell them, but if it wasn't in my rules, the MUSL rules, I couldn‚Äôt write it down,\" he said. \"I couldn‚Äôt document that I saw this gaping hole because they didn‚Äôt want to hear it or they didn‚Äôt want it written down anywhere.‚Äù\n\nAnd so the secret code survived.\n\nThat code was replicated on as many as 17 state lottery systems as MUSL integrated the random-number software Tipton designed. For nearly a decade, it allowed Tipton to rig the drawings for games played on three dates each year: May 27, Nov. 23 and Dec. 29.\n\nTipton's software version is no longer used.\n\nThe big mistake\n\nIt was on Dec. 23, 2010, that Eddie made a miscalculation that ultimately unraveled his scheme: He bought a winning ticket himself.\n\nBefore, he had always funneled winning numbers to others.\n\nVideo captured his ticket purchase at a Des Moines convenience store about 10 miles from the Multi-State Lottery Association offices.\n\nThough he knew the Iowa Lottery had retained a video of the purchase, Eddie told one of his best friends, Robert Rhodes, that he could claim the ticket if he wanted.\n\nBut Eddie gave Rhodes one caveat: Don‚Äôt wait until the last minute to claim the ticket.\n\nThat advice was ignored.\n\nRhodes participated in an intricate plan to claim the prize anonymously ‚Äî less than two hours before the 4 p.m. deadline on Dec. 29, 2011.\n\nThe 11th-hour scheme to claim the ticket captivated the public's attention. The $16.5 million jackpot was the third-largest prize in Hot Lotto's history.\n\nFor weeks, lottery officials had peppered news media across the country to publicize the unclaimed ticket. Then, just as the year-long window was to expire, two attorneys representing a trust showed up at Iowa Lottery headquarters to claim the prize.\n\nBut Iowa law requires Iottery winners' names and addresses to be made public, and the mystery over who was behind the claim dominated newscasts for weeks.\n\nDespite the intense scrutiny, it would take investigators roughly three years to connect Tipton to the Hot Lotto rigging. On Jan. 15, 2015, he was charged with two counts of felony fraud.\n\nHe later faced other charges, mostly related to money laundering and fraudulent wins in other states.\n\nHis brother Tommy and Rhodes also were charged with felonies related to the rigged drawings.\n\nRhodes, of Sugar Land, Texas, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of being party to a computer crime and was sentenced in March 2017 to six months of home confinement in Texas and ordered to pay $409,000 in restitution.\n\nHe agreed to testify against Eddie and Tommy Tipton as part of his plea deal.\n\nTommy and Eddie pleaded guilty to felony crimes related to the rigging scheme in June 2017 and agreed to repay $2.2 million in restitution.\n\nTommy admitted claiming prizes in Colorado and Oklahoma using numbers Eddie provided. He was sentenced to 75 days in jail.\n\nEddie was sentenced in August to up to 25 years in prison.\n\nEddie, 54, did not respond to a request to speak for this article. He is serving his sentence in Iowa's Clarinda Correctional Facility.\n\nIt's uncertain how many years Eddie will spend in prison. He could be paroled within three or four years, his attorneys noted at his sentencing last year.\n\nHe has paid $25,000 of his $16.8 million in restitution, according to the most recent court records filed in January.\n\nMore from the USA TODAY Network on this story:\n\nMore:They cheated the Iowa Lottery but got to keep the money\n\nMore:Some Iowa Lottery retail employees win big, raising suspicions\n\nMore:Iowa Lottery takes a pass on fixes to stop cheaters.

But one stipulation has hindered their property search to such a degree that they‚Äôve been stuck in a Canandaigua rental home for the past two years.\n\nThat would be high-speed internet.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pretty easy to please, but the internet is a must-have, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs killing us,‚Äù said Kim Savino, whose husband needs a strong internet connection for his full-time remote job. Savino also uses video and internet teaching tools to homeschool her 11-year-old twins.\n\nThe family scoured the region for a 5-acre property where they could simultaneously raise chickens and bees and access the internet easily ‚Äî but to no avail. They checked with neighbors and internet service providers each time a property seemed promising, only to be disappointed by the available connection options.\n\n‚ÄúTwo years ago, we thought this would be fun,‚Äù said Savino. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.‚Äù\n\nThe Savinos are one of many families who have been affected by the lack of reliable internet connection in rural pockets of the Finger Lakes region. Those living and working in these areas often struggle with fragile connections, outdated equipment or slow speeds, making it increasingly difficult for some families to conduct work or homework activities at home.\n\nWhile providers like Frontier Communications, Charter Spectrum and Empire Access and others are either offering or planning to offer coverage in places like Ontario or Livingston County, buildout for fiber or cable infrastructure is expensive, say providers, and can be slow, leaving customers to make do with whatever they can get.\n\nThe haves and have nots of broadband\n\nThe state of New York has pumped millions into helping providers build rural networks in the Finger Lakes and elsewhere through its $500 million Broadband for All program. But pockets of residents still are waiting for better, or any, connectivity, said Phil Dampier of Stop the Cap, a local advocacy group that fights for better broadband access.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a utility now, and we need universal access,‚Äù said Dampier. ‚ÄúEconomically there‚Äôs a major price to pay and rural communities cannot afford to be left out.‚Äù\n\nData from BroadbandNow.com indicates that about 491,000 people across New York state either lack access to any wired internet service, or lack access to a provider that supplies broadband internet, which is a defined by the Federal Communications Commission as a connection of 25 megabits per second or faster. That number balloons out to over 19 million people nationally lacking access to broadband in rural areas.\n\nAccording to 2017 census data estimates, between 15 percent and 18 percent of residents in Livingston and Ontario Counties don‚Äôt have any internet connection at all, and nearly a quarter of residents in Wayne County aren‚Äôt connected. For comparison, only 12 percent of Monroe County residents lack any household internet access.\n\nFor those connected in Livingston County, an average 75 percent use dial-up, cable, fiber optic or Digital Subscription Line, or DSL.\n\nThat figure is slightly higher in Ontario County and slightly lower in Wayne County. Smaller percentages of residents use satellite or cellular connectivity.\n\nThe FCC maps internet options across the country, but data about broadband access can be skewed based on reporting procedures, said Dampier. For example, if just a few households in a census block have broadband internet, the entire block could be marked as having access.\n\nThat means some residents may fall down the priority list, he said.\n\nConnectivity a roadblock for rural employees\n\nBrian Seeley, a solutions consultant who works remotely from home, moved to Bloomfield, Ontario County, from Avon, Livingston County, with his family about five years ago, leaving a solid internet connection behind and hoping for the best at his new residence.\n\nSince then, he's been bouncing between multiple speed offerings from Frontier, none of which could reliably handle certain work tasks such as conducting video chats or making calls over the internet, he said.\n\n\"I've had to hold off on making any advanced technology upgrades to my home that would leverage the internet (such as a WiFi-connected thermostat) because it'll just take it down,\" said Seeley. When he inquired about connecting his home to Spectrum internet about five years ago, he was told it would set him back $15,000 to extend the line to his home.\n\nJackie Cochrane works out of her Naples, Ontario County, home and has a backup for her backup when it comes to internet connection ‚Äî but sometimes she still runs out of choices.\n\nCochrane works as a care manager for an insurance company and relies heavily on phone and internet service to contact clients. She‚Äôs lucky if she gets a bar or two of Verizon cell service, and her work cell phone isn‚Äôt any better than her personal line. She tried Frontier‚Äôs internet telephone service, but that was ‚Äúdisconnected more than it was connected,‚Äù she said.\n\nNow she uses satellite service with an internet telephone add-on ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt interface with her work equipment. On occasion, she‚Äôs given up and gone to the local library.\n\n‚ÄúI have also considered just moving,‚Äù she said.\n\nMoving might be an option for those who work from a desk. But for rural farmers competing to sell products and operate cutting-edge equipment, a lack of internet access translates to an economic hit, said Russell Klein, president of the Wyoming County Farm Bureau and a fourth-generation owner of Silver Meadows Farm in Wyoming County.\n\nKlein‚Äôs farm milks cows with a robotic system that still operates if the farm‚Äôs internet cuts out ‚Äî but without a connection, the system won‚Äôt alert operators to internal problems, he said. Farms or farm stands interested in promoting their goods online struggle without ready access to the online world.\n\n‚ÄúThe folks who are trying to live out here and have businesses out here and can‚Äôt connect, it really does put them at a disadvantage,‚Äù he said.\n\nAlyson Kaufman welcomed her family's 2017 move to Honeoye, Ontario County, as a way to get her kids out into nature in her childhood hometown. But the transition brought a slew of internet-related headaches.\n\nTheir property was rejected by multiple local providers who said it was simply not reachable with broadband technology, and for a time, the family was paying over $550 a month for satellite service, streaming services and cell phone lines, said Kaufman.\n\nAs a teacher in the Wayland-Cohocton Central School District, Kaufman used to have to stay in her classroom until 8 p.m. some nights so she could use the district‚Äôs internet connection to get work done. Her home internet would slow to a crawl between 3 p.m. and 1 a.m. each day during peak usage, and often they‚Äôd run out of their allotted monthly data within a week.\n\n‚ÄúI barely used my computer. ... It just never worked,‚Äù she said.\n\nThis fall, she and her wife, Andi, settled on taking out a third cell phone line connected to a MiFi mobile hotspot, which amplifies the signal throughout the house, she said. This arrangement has worked well so far, and she‚Äôs not optimistic about any other internet service providers reaching her location any time soon.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not worth their money,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI understand that from an economic standpoint, but from the standpoint of humanity, when we‚Äôre all trying to survive in this world of technology ‚Ä¶ internet is no longer a privilege, it‚Äôs a right.‚Äù\n\nSTADDEO@Gannett.com\n\nWho‚Äôs here?\n\nCharter Spectrum\n\nSpectrum has built thousands of miles of cable and is always looking to expand based on ‚Äúdensity, geography and overall economic feasibility,‚Äù according to a company spokesperson.\n\nThe company's baseline offering throughout its service area, including rural homes, is 100 mbps, with additional speed options of 400 mbps and 1 gigabit, or 1,000 mbps.\n\nFrontier Communications\n\nFrontier advertises up to 12 megabits per second on the company's website for these areas, and seems to quickly address any connectivity issues that arise for customers. Some areas receive download speeds as fast as 25 Mbps, said a company spokesperson, and about 1,100 homes in new subdivisions in Canandaigua, Victor and Farmington are currently eligible for Frontier fiber-to-home service.\n\nCustomers with service concerns should call (800) 921-8106.\n\nHughes Network Systems\n\nSatellite providers like Hughes Net are available across the region.\n\nHughes Network advertises speeds of 25 mbps download. Service is available now but prices will be changing as part of a state broadband initiative offering, said a spokesperson.\n\nWho's coming?\n\nEmpire Access\n\nEmpire Access, a telecommunications company operating in New York and Pennsylvania, offers fiber optic internet in more rural municipalities, including Canandaigua, Naples, Bath and Penn Yan, Yates County.\n\nThey‚Äôd like to expand to other areas of Ontario County in the near future, including Honeoye, Shortsville and Manchester, he said.\n\nRTO Wireless\n\nIn the Southern Tier and the Adirondacks, providers like RTO are partnering with Microsoft's Airband Initiative to provide broadband access to some of the state's most rural communities.\n\nThe initiative will use a variety of technologies ‚Äî including ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù technology, which uses extra television frequency for internet connection ‚Äî to hook 20 New York counties to wireless or fixed access in 2019.\n\nVerizon Wireless\n\nVerizon announced this summer that it would expand its broadband network to another 47,000 households in parts of upstate, the Hudson Valley and Long Island.\n\nVerizon and other telecommunications companies are also involved building out 5G networks across the U.S., which is the next generation of wireless technology that could technically support rural broadband.\n\nStruggling with your internet service?

Forget streaming Netflix, much less working or studying from home. Even the police department has trouble uploading its reports.\n\nJulie Dolan, a 65-year-old retiree in Sandwich, has asthma. Her husband has high blood pressure. Dolan doubts her substandard home internet could manage a remote medical appointment, and these days no one wants to visit the doctor if they can help it. That leaves 19th-century technology ‚Äì her landline phone. \"That is all I would have,\" she says.\n\nAs schools, workplaces and public services shut down in the age of coronavirus, online connections are keeping Americans in touch with vital institutions and each other. But that's not much of an option when fast internet service is hard to come by.\n\nMore:What happens if you can't pay rent on April 1 because coronavirus forced you out of work?\n\nAlthough efforts to extend broadband service have made progress in recent years, tens of millions of people are still left out, largely because phone and cable companies hesitate to invest in far-flung rural areas. Government subsidies in the billions haven't fully fixed the problem.\n\nMany more simply can't afford broadband. U.S. broadband costs more than in many comparable countries ‚Äì an average of $58 a month compared to $46.55 across 29 nations, according to a 2018 Federal Communications Commission report.\n\nSuch disconnected people \"already have to work harder to tread water,\" said Chris Mitchell, who advocates for community broadband service at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"I don't think people appreciated the magnitude of the problem.\"\n\nEven in cities, the high cost of internet access means many go without. Low-cost local alternatives such as libraries and cafes have shut down.\n\nIn St. Louis, Stella Ashcraft, 63, lives from check to check and can't afford internet. Her senior center, where she plays bingo, does puzzles and gets lunch five days a week, is closed. So is her church and the library where she checks email. She's gotten texted photos of her newborn grandchild, but forget about a Zoom call to see the baby.\n\n\"I feel very withdrawn, isolated, alone,\" she said.\n\nThere are no definitive numbers on those without broadband. The FCC puts the number at 21 million, but its data is faulty and most likely undercounts the problem. An independent group called BroadbandNow pegs it at 42 million. The digital divide disproportionately affects rural areas, African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans on tribal lands.\n\nMore:Coronavirus' 'social distancing' is a scammer's dream. Here's how to not be a victim\n\nPhone and cable companies have pledged not to cut people off if they can't pay bills and have opened their Wi-Fi hotspots to the public. Some are expanding low-cost programs for poor people and lifting data caps so more people can get and stay connected.\n\nMillions of Americans working from home are learning to use online video in place of face-to-face meetings, but that's not an option for those with only a trickle of data service.\n\nBrie Morrissey, who owns a building outfitted with broadband in Dublin, N.H., would prefer to maintain social distance by working from home. But she keeps heading into the office for the connection, and as a result, is constantly cleaning the place ‚Äì wiping down door knobs, the bathroom sinks and \"every inch of the building,\" she says.\n\nMorrissey avoids other tenants and won't rent space to anyone else. Most people recover from the virus, but the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to get seriously ill or die.\n\n\"I have to tell people to stay home and that we can't accommodate them, which is a hard thing to do for a small business owner in a small town,\" she said. \"You obviously want to help. But following guidelines means for the most part we can't.\"\n\nStudents, meanwhile, struggle with a \"homework gap\" when they can't get or submit assignments, much less watch online lectures or participate in discussions. Online schoolwork is now the norm, but the millions of students who don't have home internet or access to computers at home require creative solutions as schools shut down.\n\nIn rural western Alabama, less than 1% of Perry County's roughly 9,100 residents have high-quality internet at home, so online lessons are out. County teachers spent three days manually loading scanned images of math worksheets and other materials on to iPads and Chromebooks for the system's 1,100 students to take home while out of class, said Superintendent John Heard.\n\nA New York City family shelter has no Wi-Fi and 175 school-age children, only 15 of whom have laptops. City schools are sending some kids tablets equipped with internet service. But Estrella Montanez, who runs the shelter, worries that kids will have trouble managing remote work.\n\n\"Many families are not so tech-savvy,\" she said.\n\nLawmakers want the federal government to send schools and libraries more money to lend out Wi-Fi hotspots to students. But the FCC says it's not authorized to do that under current law and is discussing a solution with Congress.\n\nMore:How quickly can the economy bounce back from the coronavirus?\n\nOn Navajo Nation, the country's largest Native American reservation, it's common to see people sitting in their vehicles at night outside local government centers, fast-food restaurants and grocery stores to connect to Wi-Fi. Din√© College is lending laptops to students and asking internet providers to improve service.\n\nDigital-access advocates hope that this crisis propels the government to do more to get people connected. In some places, relief was expected later this year. But that's too late to help with the current crisis.\n\nA cable company is supposed to start servicing Berkshires town Peru, Massachusetts, later this year. State Rep. Paul Mark has only satellite internet now, though, and that doesn't let him videoconference. Even Facebook video is a strain. And, like many others in his area, he also has unreliable mobile service at home. To help his constituents, he has to get in his car and drive around to get on calls and go on local TV and radio.\n\n\"It's a hassle,\" he said during a recent phone interview from his car as he drove to the Boston statehouse.

Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they‚Äôre allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest‚Äôs schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n‚ÄúThose turnaround times bog things down,‚Äù Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest‚Äôs customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest‚Äôs flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n‚ÄúThe phone system the company uses is just not working,‚Äù Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN‚Äôs Pamela Brown. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that‚Äôs created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.‚Äù\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company‚Äôs outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest‚Äôs crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest‚Äôs scheduling efforts.\n\n‚ÄúThe process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,‚Äù Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company‚Äôs scheduling software wasn‚Äôt able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n‚ÄúAs a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it‚Äôs extraordinarily difficult,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is a tedious, long process.‚Äù\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n‚ÄúThey would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,‚Äù Watterson said. ‚ÄúSo, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.‚Äù\n\nIn reducing the company‚Äôs flights by two thirds, Southwest should have ‚Äúmore than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,‚Äù Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having these issues for the past 20 months,‚Äù he told CNN. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.‚Äù\n\nHe said the airline‚Äôs operations haven‚Äôt changed much since the 1990s.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs phones, it‚Äôs computers, it‚Äôs processing power, it‚Äôs the programs used to connect us to airplanes ‚Äì that‚Äôs where the problem lies, and it‚Äôs systemic throughout the whole airline,‚Äù he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray‚Äôs concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n‚ÄúPart of what we‚Äôre suffering is a lack of tools,‚Äù Jordan told employees. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.‚Äù\n\nHe said the airline is ‚Äúcommitted to and invested in‚Äù improving its systems, but ‚Äúwe need to be able to produce solutions faster.‚Äù\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they‚Äôre eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n‚ÄúOur Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,‚Äù Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n‚ÄúUSDOT is concerned by Southwest‚Äôs unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,‚Äù the agency tweeted. ‚ÄúThe Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.‚Äù\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest‚Äôs first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that‚Äôs because this isn‚Äôt the first time Southwest‚Äôs service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month‚Äôs service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October‚Äôs disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n‚ÄúWe have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,‚Äù said Kelly on October 21. ‚ÄúWe are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.‚Äù\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to ‚Äúmanagement‚Äôs poor planning.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì CNN‚Äôs Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/ftx-customer-money-bankruptcy/index.html", "title": "FTX: Customers who trusted crypto giant may be left with nothing ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nAs the dust settles from one of the most shocking financial implosions in history, one of the key unknowns is how much customers who can‚Äôt access their money expect to get back from FTX, the crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy last week.\n\nThe answer, according to legal experts, may be zero.\n\nBefore its unraveling, FTX.com marketed itself as a safe-for-beginners destination for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. But a liquidity crunch last week forced FTX to halt withdrawals, leaving customers and investors in limbo. FTX reportedly used customer funds to prop up its sister hedge fund‚Äôs high-risk trading operation without permission, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOn Friday, FTX and the hedge fund, Alameda Research, filed for bankruptcy.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are now investigating the exchange‚Äôs collapse, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. And authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, launched a criminal probe into the firm over the weekend.\n\nThe legal ramifications for FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, remain unclear. But as the exchange, once valued at more than $30 billlion, collapses, it looks increasingly likely that customers who handed their money over to FTX could be left holding the bag.\n\n‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt know the extent of contagion,‚Äù said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses Singer and a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer. ‚ÄúThe first ring of victims are the people who had assets held in FTX‚Ä¶They are probably not going to be made whole, or anywhere close to it.‚Äù\n\nThere are a few reasons for this.\n\nIn a traditional US bank failure, the government insures customer deposits, making them whole up to $250,000. But there simply is no mechanism for depositor insurance in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn theory, FTX‚Äôs customers should get a cut of what‚Äôs left of the company‚Äôs assets at the end of the bankruptcy process. But so far, at least, it‚Äôs not clear how much will be left to disburse.\n\n‚ÄúAs far as I know, they have two assets ‚Äî the goodwill value of the exchange and the value of their FTT coins,‚Äù said Eric Snyder, head of the bankruptcy department at the law firm Wilk Auslander. (Goodwill value refers to intangible assets like a brand‚Äôs reputation and intellectual property. And FTT coins, the crypto token issued by FTX, have lost more than 90% of their value over the past week.)\n\nIn bankruptcies, Snyder explains, there‚Äôs a fairly simple formula to figure out how much creditors ‚Äî in this case, FTX depositors ‚Äî will receive.\n\n‚ÄúThe numerator is the assets, the denominator‚Äôs liability. You divide one into the other, and the [result] is what everybody gets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if people are pulling out all the assets, then there‚Äôs not going to be much of a numerator.‚Äù\n\nHe added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very conceivable that the return will be minimal at best.‚Äù\n\nOf course, the suddenness of FTX‚Äôs downfall makes it a difficult case to assess this early on, lawyers say.\n\nNormally, companies would have weeks to prepare bankruptcy filings that disclose, among other things, an explanation of why the company sought Chapter 11 protection and what it aims to accomplish in bankruptcy court.\n\nDan Besikof, a partner at Loeb & Loeb who specializes in bankruptcy, says it‚Äôs too soon to say whether customers are going to get any money back.\n\n‚ÄúAll you can really do is guess from tweets where things stand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd how customers recover their money might depend on a lot of different things, including which entity they hold the money through, what amount of the coins still remain.‚Äù\n\nThe FTX fallout has rattled the entire crypto industry, raising serious questions about the future of digital assets and the lack of global regulation.\n\nOn Monday, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of FTX competitor Binance, sought to reassure his audience of the sector‚Äôs legitimacy.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious that people are jittery,‚Äù said Zhao, widely known as CZ, in a question-and-answer session on Twitter. ‚ÄúI want to say, short-term, it is painful. But I think this is actually good for the industry long-term.‚Äù\n\nThe giant crypto exchange briefly emerged as a lifeline for FTX before reversing course last week.\n\nZhao, whose tweet announcing Binance‚Äôs divestment in FTX helped fuel the smaller firm‚Äôs liquidity crisis, has denied having a ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù to expose FTX. Still, critics note the biggest, and perhaps only, winner in the downfall of FTX is none other than Zhao, now unquestionably the wealthiest and most influential player in digital asset trading.\n\n‚ÄúAs much as some people blame me for whistleblowing or poking the bubble, I apologize for that ‚Ä¶ I apologize for any turmoil that I caused.

February inflation data, due out Tuesday, was expected to be the deciding factor between a quarter- and half-point move. The latter gained favor amid forecasts of another swift rise in consumer prices.\n\nThings have changed.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n‚ÄúInflation is no longer the sole focus for the Federal Reserve,‚Äù says Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist of Nationwide Mutual.\n\nWill more banks fail?:Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank failures explained, live updates on new developments\n\nBiden assures consumers:Banking crisis: President Joe Biden says taxpayer money won't be used to bail out SVB, Signature Bank\n\nLive updates:The latest developments following SVB's collapse\n\nCould the Fed pause rate hikes?\n\nNationwide, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and NatWest were among research firms predicting the Fed will keep rates unchanged or are at least leaning toward that forecast.\n\n‚ÄúIn light of recent stress in the banking system, we no longer expect the (Fed) to deliver a rate hike at its March 22 meeting with considerable uncertainty about the path beyond March,‚Äù Goldman Sachs wrote Sunday in a note to clients.\n\nOpinion:SVB's failure poses serious challenge for America's innovation economy\n\nOpinion:Blaming Silicon Valley Bank collapse on diversity or 'wokeness' gives away Republican game\n\nFor now, Goldman still expects quarter-point rate increases in May, June and July, bringing the Fed‚Äôs key short-term rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% ‚Äì a quarter point below its earlier estimate.\n\nBarclays reckons the Fed will likely hold rates steady next week, though it adds a quarter-point move is possible. It expects the central bank to pause after reaching a peak rate of 5% to 5.25%, a half point below its earlier projection.\n\nKevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist of NatWest, is going further. He believes the Fed will keep rates unchanged next week and figures it‚Äôs probably done hiking after the most aggressive flurry of increases since the early 1980s. The Fed‚Äôs key rate is at 4.5% to 4.75%, up from near zero a year ago.\n\n‚ÄúI think in response to the uncertainty and financial stability concerns they‚Äôve got to be really cautious going forward,‚Äù Cummins says.\n\nWhat did the government do to eliminate bank runs?\n\nOn Sunday, the Fed, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved to settle markets by announcing funding to allow all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to access all their cash, not just the $250,000 insured by the FDIC.\n\nRegulators also said they were making loans available to other institutions so depositors can access all their cash if there are similar bank runs.\n\nBut Bostjancic says many regional banks may be reluctant to draw on those loans because of the stigma that could brand them as troubled, leading more depositors to withdraw their money. Even with the loans, many depositors could try to move their cash from riskier regional banks to larger banks, causing the regionals to curtail lending and possibly become insolvent, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, share prices of regional banks plunged Monday, further stoking concerns about their survival.\n\nThe crisis also probably will make banks less likely to approve loans, further damping consumer and business confidence and the economy, Bostjancic and Cummins say. That's another reason the Fed could hoist rates more gradually or take a break, they say.\n\nWhat caused Silicon Valley Bank to collapse?\n\nThe crisis began when SVB depositors, largely tech startups, began withdrawing their money to cover operating costs as venture capital funding dried up. SVB was forced to sell bonds that had tumbled in value because of the Fed rate increases, raising concerns about its solvency and intensifying the bank run.\n\nAnalysts say SVB was in a unique predicament because of its tech-heavy client base and large share of assets in investments, particularly bonds, rather than loans. But the meltdown sparked fears of similar runs at other regional banks.\n\nWill the Fed continue to raise rates?\n\nEY-Parthenon and Oxford Economics were among research firms that still expect the Fed to follow through with a quarter-point rate increase next week, especially if markets and worries about the regional banks calm in coming days.\n\nLast fall, the Bank of England intervened in a U.K. pension crisis by buying bonds but still approved a three-quarter-point rate increase, says Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon.\n\n‚ÄúRisking a loss in the battle against inflation is not something Fed Chair Powell wants to do,‚Äù Daco wrote in a note to clients. Tuesday‚Äôs inflation report ‚Äúmay still play a defining role‚Äù in the Fed‚Äôs decision.\n\nHe added that even a half-point increase is still possible.\n\nIn other words, expect more market drama. Typically, Fed officials signal their interest rate plans before meeting, but they‚Äôre now in a quiet period and barred from communicating with the public.

Even if that means triggering a recession. And even if it comes at the expense of consumers and businesses far beyond US borders.\n\nThere‚Äôs now a 98% chance of a global recession, according to research firm Ned Davis, which brings some sobering historical credibility to the table.

That growth engine is beginning to sputter. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/ZUMA Press\n\nWhen economists warn of a downturn, they‚Äôre typically basing their assessment on a variety of indicators.\n\nLet‚Äôs unpack five key trends:\n\nThe mighty US dollar\n\nThe US dollar plays an outsized role in the global economy and international finance. And right now, it is stronger than it‚Äôs been in two decades.\n\nThe simplest explanation comes back to the Fed.\n\nWhen the US central bank raises interest rates, as it has been doing since March, it makes the dollar more appealing to investors around the world.\n\nIn any economic climate, the dollar is seen as a safe place to park your money. In a tumultuous climate ‚Äî a global pandemic, say, or a war in Eastern Europe ‚Äî investors have even more incentive to purchase dollars, usually in the form of US government bonds.\n\nThe Bank of England intervened in the bond market this week restore confidence in UK assets. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhile a strong dollar is a nice perk for Americans traveling abroad, it creates headaches for just about everyone else.\n\nThe value of the UK pound, the euro, China‚Äôs yuan and Japan‚Äôs yen, among many others, has tumbled. That makes it more expensive for those nations to import essential items like food and fuel.\n\nIn response, central banks that are already fighting pandemic-induced inflation wind up raising rates higher and faster to shore up the value of their own currencies.\n\nThe dollar‚Äôs strength also creates destabilizing effects for Wall Street, as many of the S&P 500 companies do business around the world. By one estimate from Morgan Stanley, each 1% rise in the dollar index has a negative 0.5% impact on S&P 500 earnings.\n\nAmerica‚Äôs economic engine stalls\n\nThe No. 1 driver of the world‚Äôs largest economy is shopping. And America‚Äôs shoppers are tired.\n\nAfter more than a year of rising prices on just about everything, with wages not keeping up, consumers have pulled back.\n\n‚ÄúThe hardship caused by inflation means that consumers are dipping into their savings,‚Äù EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a note Friday. The personal saving rate in August remained unchanged at only 3.5%, Daco said ‚Äî near its lowest rate since 2008, and well below its pre-Covid level of around 9%.\n\nOnce again, the reason behind the pullback has a lot to do with the Fed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, is aggressively raising rates to combat inflation ‚Äî even if it risks triggering a recession. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nInterest rates have risen at a historic pace, pushing mortgage rates to their highest level in more than a decade and making it harder for businesses to grow. Eventually, the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes should broadly bring costs down. But in the meantime, consumers are getting a one-two punch of high borrowing rates and high prices, especially when it comes to necessities like food and housing.\n\nAmericans opened their wallets during the 2020 lockdowns, which powered the economy out of its brief-but-severe pandemic recession. Since then, government aid has evaporated and inflation has taken root, pushing prices up at their fastest rate in 40 years and sapping consumers‚Äô spending power.\n\nCorporate America tightens its belt\n\nBusiness has been booming across industries for the bulk of the pandemic era, even with historically high inflation eating into profits. That is thanks (once again) to the tenacity of American shoppers, as businesses were largely able to pass on their higher costs to consumers to cushion profit margins.\n\nBut the earnings bonanza may not last.\n\nIn mid-September, one company whose fortunes serve as a kind of economic bellwether gave investors a shock.\n\nFedEx, which operates in more than 200 countries, unexpectedly revised its outlook, warning that demand was softening, and earnings were likely to plunge more than 40%.\n\nIn an interview, its CEO was asked whether he believes the slowdown was a sign of a looming global recession.\n\n‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúThese numbers, they don‚Äôt portend very well.‚Äù\n\nFedEx, with its global footprint, is an economic bellwether. Its revised outlook has renewed recession fears on Wall Street. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFedEx isn‚Äôt alone. On Tuesday, Apple‚Äôs stock fell after Bloomberg reported the company was scrapping plans to increase iPhone 14 production after demand came in below expectations.\n\nAnd just ahead of the holiday season, when employers would normally ramp up hiring, the mood is now more cautious.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not seen the normal September uptick in companies posting for temporary help,‚Äù said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ‚ÄúCompanies are hanging back and waiting to see what conditions hold.‚Äù\n\nWelcome to bear territory\n\nWall Street has been hit with whiplash, and stocks are now on track for their worst year since 2008 ‚Äî in case anyone needs yet another scary historical comparison.\n\nBut last year was a very different story. Equity markets thrived in 2021, with the S&P 500 soaring 27%, thanks to a torrent of cash pumped in by the Federal Reserve, which unleashed a double-barreled monetary-easing policy in the spring of 2020 to keep financial markets from crumbling.\n\nThe party lasted until early 2022. But as inflation set in, the Fed began to take away the proverbial punch bowl, raising interest rates and unwinding its bond-buying mechanism that had propped up the market.\n\nThe hangover has been brutal. The S&P 500, the broadest measure of Wall Street ‚Äî and the index responsible for the bulk of Americans‚Äô 401(k)s ‚Äî is down nearly 24% for the year. And it‚Äôs not alone. All three major US indexes are in bear markets ‚Äî down at least 20% from their most recent highs.\n\nIn an unfortunate twist, bond markets, typically a safe haven for investors when stocks and other assets decline, are also in a tailspin.\n\nAll three major US indexes are in a bear market, down at least 20% from their most recent highs. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nOnce again, blame the Fed.\n\nInflation, along with the steep rise in interest rates by the central bank, has pushed bond prices down, which causes bond yields (aka the return an investor gets for their loan to the government) to go up.\n\nOn Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury briefly surpassed 4%, hitting its highest level in 14 years. That surge was followed by a steep drop in response to the Bank of England‚Äôs intervention in its own spiraling bond market ‚Äî amounting to tectonic moves in a corner of the financial world that is designed to be steady, if not downright boring.\n\nEuropean bond yields are also spiking as central banks follow the Fed‚Äôs lead in raising rates to shore up their own currencies.\n\nBottom line: There are few safe places for investors to put their money right now, and that‚Äôs unlikely to change until global inflation gets under control and central banks loosen their grips.\n\nWar, soaring prices and radical policies collide\n\nNowhere is the collision of economic, financial, and political calamities more painfully visible than in the United Kingdom.\n\nLike the rest of the world, the UK has struggled with surging prices that are largely attributable to the colossal shock of Covid-19, followed by the trade disruptions created by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. As the West cut off imports of Russian natural gas, energy prices have soared and supplies have dwindled.\n\nThose events were bad enough on their own.\n\nBut then, just over a week ago, the freshly installed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss announced a sweeping tax-cut plan that economists from both ends of the political spectrum have decried as unorthodox at best, diabolical at worst.\n\nIn short, the Truss administration said it would slash taxes for all Britons to encourage spending and investment and, in theory, soften the blow of a recession. But the tax cuts aren‚Äôt funded, which means the government must take on debt to finance them.\n\nThat decision set off a panic in financial markets and put Downing Street in a standoff with its independent central bank, the Bank of England. Investors around the world sold off UK bonds in droves, plunging the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly 230 years. As in, since 1792, when Congress made the US dollar legal tender.\n\nThe BOE staged an emergency intervention to buy up UK bonds on Wednesday and restore order in financial markets. It stemmed the bleeding, for now. But the ripple effects of the Trussonomics turmoil is spreading far beyond the offices of bond traders.\n\nBritons, who are already in a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation at 10% ‚Äî the highest of any G7 economy ‚Äî are now panicking over higher borrowing costs that could force millions of homeowners‚Äô monthly mortgage payments to go up by hundreds or even thousands of pounds.\n\nThe upshot\n\nWhile the consensus is that a global recession is likely sometime in 2023, it‚Äôs impossible to predict how severe it will be or how long it will last. Not every recession is as painful as the 2007-09 Great Recession, but every recession is, of course, painful.\n\nSome economies, particularly the United States, with its strong labor market and resilient consumers, will be able to withstand the blow better than others.\n\n‚ÄúWe are in uncharted waters in the months ahead,‚Äù wrote economists at the World Economic Forum in a report this week.\n\n‚ÄúThe immediate outlook for the global economy and for much of the world‚Äôs population is dark,‚Äù they continued, adding that the challenges ‚Äúwill test the resilience of economies and societies and exact a punishing human toll.‚Äù\n\nBut there are some silver linings, they said. Crises force transformations that can ultimately improve standards of living and make economies stronger.\n\n‚ÄúBusinesses have to change. This has been the story since the pandemic started,‚Äù said Rima Bhatia, an economic adviser for Gulf International Bank. ‚ÄúBusinesses no longer can continue on the path that they were at. That‚Äôs the opportunity and that‚Äôs the silver lining.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî CNN Business‚Äô Julia Horowitz, Anna Cooban, Mark Thompson, Matt Egan and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/22/weather/mississippi-river-low-level-drought-climate/index.html", "title": "Mississippi River has dropped to record-low levels amid severe ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nPhotos and satellite imagery from the central United States show how the region‚Äôs worst drought in at least a decade has pushed the Mississippi River and its tributaries to drop to record lows this month.\n\nAcross the river basin, dozens of gauges have fallen below their low-water threshold.

The demonstrations against Chinese President Xi Jinping and his costly zero-Covid policy are an exceedingly rare case of widespread civil disobedience.\n\nWhile the protests represent an unprecedented challenge for Xi, they also carry economic and market implications. Oil plunged and hit 2022 lows on Monday, while shares of companies that rely on China for production felt the heat. Apple fell by 2.6% following reports that unrest at one of its factories could result in 6 million fewer iPhone Pros this year.\n\nWhat‚Äôs happening: China‚Äôs controversial zero-Covid policy has affected everyday life and weighed heavily on the economy. When outbreaks get bad enough, entire cities are closed: Shanghai was shut down for about two months this spring and Chengdu, a city of 21 million people, was locked down in the fall.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing eased some Covid-related restrictions, sparking hopes that the economy could soon fully reopen, but local governments once again tightened controls as cases surged. The policy doesn‚Äôt seem to be working, as cases hit record highs, but China‚Äôs low vaccination rate, relatively ineffective vaccines and aging population mean the alternative could be very deadly.\n\nThe mounting political tension has also been difficult to interpret. The protests at first seemed focused on Covid restrictions, but now appear to carry broader demands for political reform: The blank sheets of paper held up by demonstrators in Shanghai, the country‚Äôs financial hub, have already become iconic symbols of defiance against a government that limits free speech.\n\nEconomic impact: People under lockdowns say they struggle to find food and other necessities. Economic growth has slumped and unemployment has been been rising as a consequence of the lockdowns.\n\nThe policy has also led to major global production constraints that are sustaining inflation. Global supply chain pressures increased moderately in October after five consecutive months of easing, largely due to increases in Asian delivery times, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York‚Äôs Global Supply Chain Pressure Index.\n\nHowever, commodities slid on China concerns Monday. Oil prices dropped sharply, with investors concerned that surging Covid cases and protests in China may sap demand from one of the world‚Äôs largest oil consumers.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next: Chinese government officials are in a strange spot. They don‚Äôt want to end their covid policy but they also want to ensure that the political unrest doesn‚Äôt grow. Companies that do business in China are watching closely for any clues about what the future may hold. They‚Äôre also considering moving production away from the country in the long term ‚Äî Apple has already shifted some of its manufacturing to India.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in a research report published late on Sunday, predicted that protests could lead China to scrap its zero-Covid policy earlier than previously expected, with ‚Äúsome chance of a forced and disorderly exit.‚Äù\n\nBut the next few days could be pivotal. If protests flare up again, the Chinese government will likely be forced to react in some way. On Tuesday, it announced an ‚Äúaction plan‚Äù to boost vaccination rates among the elderly. But ‚Äúwith a rapid spread of new COVID cases, it‚Äôs hard to envision a broad lifting of restrictions that would boost the country‚Äôs economic outlook for next year significantly,‚Äù said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Baring. ‚ÄúIn any case, the continuing uncertainty of pandemic policy will lead to further pressures on global supply chains and keep prices higher than they would otherwise be.‚Äù\n\nBig data week\n\nUS investors took a short break from the trading floor last week as they celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday. Now, the vacation is definitely over. This week is chock full of important economic data releases, many of which will help guide the Fed‚Äôs next interest rate hike decision in December.\n\nHere‚Äôs what to keep an eye out for.\n\nTuesday brings a housing bonanza: At 9 a.m. ET the September House Price Index (HPI), a measure of the change in single-family house prices, is due out. The September S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index, which measures the change in the selling price of single-family homes in 20 metropolitan areas across the United States, is also due out.\n\nAlso on Tuesday: The Conference Board‚Äôs November measure for the level of consumer confidence in economic activity. That‚Äôs a leading indicator as it can predict consumer spending.\n\nWednesday is a big Fed day: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will discuss the economy and labor market at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution at 1:30 p.m. ET. A question and answer session with the audience is also expected. Traders will closely watch his speech for hints about future monetary policy.\n\nFed Governor Lisa Cook will also discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at an event hosted by the Detroit Economic Club, and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman will discuss the future of small banks, with a question and answer session afterward.\n\nMore data: Wednesday also brings some employment data. First up is The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of the monthly change in private employment, based on the payroll data of approximately 400,000 US business clients. Next comes October JOLTS, a survey by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure job vacancies.\n\nRevised numbers for third-quarter GDP and PCE inflation are also expected out and October Pending Home Sales which measures the change in the number of homes under contract to be sold.\n\nThursday is all about inflation: October‚Äôs Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET. The index measures changes in the price of goods and services purchased for consumption. Core PCE, which excludes gas and food, is the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure.\n\nFriday is jobs day: Here comes government unemployment numbers for November. Given that full employment is one of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs mandates, it is very closely watched.\n\nChicken is on the menu this holiday season\n\nExpect heavier holiday promotions this season, say Bank of America analysts. Why? Retailers are dealing with an excess of inventory they‚Äôre trying to get rid of, but it also comes down to timing.\n\nLast year, Americans did their holiday shopping earlier in the year because they were worried about shortages and because the Omicron Covid wave kept people out of stores ahead of the holidays. This year things are expected ‚Äúto mimic a normal pre-pandemic holiday,‚Äù wrote the analysts, with the exception of one thing: There‚Äôs an additional day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year because Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday.\n\n‚ÄúWe think this will likely result in a frenzied game of chicken, with shoppers waiting until the very last minute for great deals and retailers balancing selling at the highest price with moving through enough product,‚Äù said Lorraine Hutchinson, a research analyst at Bank of America.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/us/school-conditions-2022/index.html", "title": "US public schools get a D+ for poor conditions, and experts say ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nWhen it gets too hot in Denver and Baltimore classrooms, students are sent home because their schools don‚Äôt have air conditioning.\n\nIn Massachusetts, checking for rusty water leaking from a ceiling has become a ‚Äúmorning ritual.‚Äù\n\nIn California, a school‚Äôs cockroach infestation has gotten so bad that some students fear eating lunch.\n\nWhile school infrastructure problems are a perennial challenge, national data and dismal stories from teachers suggest the crises are reaching an apex. Atrocious school conditions have even prompted some teachers this school year to go on strike.\n\nHow CNN found subpar school conditions CNN asked teachers about the conditions of their schools and received more than 250 responses from across the US. Some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting to a critical stage now,‚Äù said Mike Pickens, executive director of the National Council on School Facilities. ‚ÄúThe average age of a school building now is from 49 to 50 years‚Äù ‚Äì the highest in memory. Some schools date back to World War II.\n\nBut as schools get older and more desperate for repairs, the funding gap for public schools keeps getting worse.\n\n‚ÄúAmerican Society of Civil Engineers gives the condition of America‚Äôs 100,000 public school buildings an overall grade of D+,‚Äù the National Education Association said late last year. ‚ÄúAnd no wonder ‚Äì half our school buildings are half a century old.‚Äù\n\nNow, everyone is paying the price for underfunded schools.\n\nStudents get sick, distracted or miss entire days of education when conditions turn abysmal. Parents sacrifice income to provide child care when classes suddenly get canceled.\n\nBurnt-out teachers already stressed by the pandemic and school violence are pushed closer to leaving the profession.\n\nEven those not directly connected to deteriorating schools will be impacted, Pickens said.\n\nWithout more investment in US public schools, he said, ‚Äúwe get further and further behind on the world stage.‚Äù\n\nFrom Maryland to Colorado, students struggle to breathe in oppressively hot classrooms\n\nIn Baltimore, Marcia Turner is sick of her kids feeling sick at school.\n\n‚ÄúMy children can‚Äôt even breathe in the school. It be so hot. One have asthma,‚Äù Turner told CNN affiliate WMAR.\n\nFourteen Baltimore schools don‚Äôt have any air conditioning, school district Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington told CNN. Those students get sent home early when it‚Äôs too hot to learn ‚Äì 85 degrees or higher in their classrooms, she said.\n\nStifling temperatures can impede students‚Äô academic success. Researchers who looked at millions of test scores from American high schoolers found students tend to score lower when it‚Äôs a hot school year, according to a 2018 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBut air conditioning mitigated many of the negative effects, the researchers found.\n\nThe lack of air conditioning doesn‚Äôt just stymie students‚Äô learning. It also hurts parents who can‚Äôt afford to leave work to take care of their children in the middle of the day.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt get off because I‚Äôm just starting a job,‚Äù Turner told WMAR.\n\nThe Baltimore school district‚Äôs COO said she‚Äôs frustrated, too. About 65% of the city‚Äôs public schools are over 41 years old; more than a third are over 51 years old.\n\n‚ÄúWe have such a backlog of infrastructure that has not been updated and upgraded in a consistent way. When they‚Äôre not upgraded toward the end of their life cycle, then we just hold onto them, and we just keep putting Band-Aids on them,‚Äù Washington said.\n\n‚ÄúWe do not have the dollars. We do not have the resources.‚Äù\n\nFive years ago, Baltimore had 75 public schools without air conditioning, Washington said. Installing AC in all those schools would cost $250 million ‚Äì about five times the district‚Äôs entire annual infrastructure budget.\n\nSo Baltimore Public Schools is chipping away at the problem over years. Of the 14 schools that still lack air conditioning, six will have it in the next 24 months, Washington said. The other eight will be completely renovated ‚Äì with air conditioning ‚Äì or shuttered.\n\nWhy window AC units won't fix the problem For schools that don‚Äôt have air conditioning, window AC units aren‚Äôt a practical solution, said Baltimore Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington. ‚ÄúThe challenge with these window air conditioning units is that they don‚Äôt meet what is called ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards because they do not provide the ventilation and fresh air intake required for classrooms,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe other challenge with the air conditioning box units is that they have a very short life cycle. So they may last for a year or two ‚Ä¶ (and) have to be consistently maintained and replaced. We don‚Äôt have the resources.‚Äù\n\nMany states away in Colorado, more than 30 schools in Denver Public Schools had to send kids home early and four closed for full days this month due to the heat, the district said. Temperatures soared in Denver the first full week of September, with daily highs ranging from 97 to 99 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs 88 degrees in the classroom,‚Äù said Sara, a teacher at McAuliffe International School, which had three days of early dismissal. ‚ÄúIt gets really draining, physically and emotionally, to be kind of beat down by these factors, day in and day out.‚Äù\n\nThe middle school in Colorado‚Äôs largest school district has no air conditioning, said Trena Marsal, the district‚Äôs executive director of facility management. The infrastructure, she said, was never meant for higher temperatures.\n\n‚ÄúOur oldest building is (from) 1889,‚Äù she said.\n\nForty Denver public schools still lack AC, down from 55 in 2019, Marsal said. In 2020, Denver voters approved bonds to pay, in part, for the installation of air conditioning units in schools, including a two-year plan to air-condition McAuliffe, the school district said.\n\nBut supply chain problems delayed installations this summer, leaving the work at eight schools only partially completed.\n\nSo the district has heat mitigation liaisons, Marsal said. Portable cooling units are strategically placed during the day, and windows are opened at night, she said.\n\nOpening windows, though, means ‚Äúwe basically daily get wasps and flies ‚Äì and it‚Äôs always exciting when that happens,‚Äù Sara said.\n\nIn the heat of day, Sara said, conditions in classrooms can make older kids anxious.\n\n‚ÄúYou have students, I‚Äôm sure, who are nervous about sweat stains or they sit down on a plastic chair and their butt gets sweaty,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stuff as an adult we‚Äôre not as self-conscious about, but a teenager absolutely is.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI sweat, like, everywhere,‚Äù seventh grader Zmarra Fleming told CNN affiliate KUSA. ‚ÄúIn the classrooms, it‚Äôs really hot. It‚Äôs, like, hot where the point is you can‚Äôt really breathe in there.‚Äù\n\nMcAuliffe International School student Zmarra Fleming said it was hard to breathe in her hot classroom. KUSA\n\nBut the immediate fix ‚Äì early dismissal ‚Äì caused transportation problems this month for some students. McAuliffe got out at 1:32 p.m., according to the school‚Äôs website, but Marsal said early buses weren‚Äôt requested.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very frustrating,‚Äù parent Stephanie Bates told KUSA. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine what parents who don‚Äôt have flexibility in their schedules do.‚Äù\n\nRusty water drips from classroom ceilings\n\nLeaking water in classrooms and brown, stained ceiling tiles have made for a ‚Äúmorning ritual‚Äù among some teachers at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\n‚ÄúOutside my room, in the hallway, there‚Äôs several tiles that are stained brown like rusty, dirty water from leaks,‚Äù said Eric Kolifrath, a seventh and eighth grade science teacher. ‚ÄúEveryone on my floor, especially if it‚Äôs rained, we examine the ceiling to let the custodial staff know if we see new leaks.‚Äù\n\nEric Kolifrath says it's become a \"morning ritual\" to inspect for leaks on his floor of the school. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLast school year, a ceiling tile got so wet it ‚Äúbowed out like a bowl,‚Äù Kolifrath said. So custodians wheeled in a 33-gallon trash bin to collect the water.\n\nAnother time, a leak sprang right above his classroom projector.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a problem that my principal can fix,‚Äù Kolifrath said. ‚ÄúIf she had a wand, she would wave it.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs in part because Kolifrath‚Äôs school, which serves pre-K through eighth grade, and 28 others in the district are managed by the City of Lowell, which also looks after municipal buildings, City Manager Tom Golden said.\n\nThe setup is among the myriad ways American school buildings are maintained ‚Äì which can lead to confusion over who‚Äôs responsible for repairs.\n\nA browning ceiling tile hangs over a room this school year at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLike many teachers nationwide, Kolifrath has crowdsourced financial support for his classroom.\n\nThe city is putting $2.3 million into all Lowell schools during the 2022-2023 school year and investing $389 million to build a new high school, Golden said.\n\nThe roof at J. G. Pyne was repaired last year, he said. But maintaining ceiling tiles ‚Äúwould be the responsibility of the custodians who work for the school department,‚Äù Golden said.\n\n‚ÄúWith the number of buildings that we have, there are always going to be issues and challenges on a day-to-day basis, which our lands and buildings professionals will be out there to rectify.‚Äù\n\nThe school funding gap keeps getting worse\n\nThe money spent on fixing or building US public schools falls woefully short of what‚Äôs needed to get buildings up to standard, according to the latest ‚ÄúState of Our Schools‚Äù report by the 21st Century School Fund, the International WELL Building Institute and the National Council on School Facilities.\n\nAnd the gap is widening. In 2016, public schools were underfunded by $46 billion a year (or $60 billion, when adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars), the report said. By 2021, that annual deficit had grown by $25 billion.\n\nWhere does funding for public school buildings come from? The funding sources and ratios vary across the country. But in general, ‚Äúlocal school districts bear the heaviest responsibilities for school construction capital funding,‚Äù according to the 2021 ‚ÄúState of Our Schools‚Äù report. From fiscal years 2009 to 2019: Local school districts paid 77% of the costs for PK-12 capital projects. States paid 22% to districts for capital outlay and debt service. But state support is highly variable, with 11 states paying nothing to eight states paying over half the district-level capital costs. Public school districts got slightly more than 1% from federal funds for school construction.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a gap of about $85 billion in our country from where we are to where we need to be to be current with codes and standards and the quality of education,‚Äù Pickens said. ‚ÄúIn that, $57 billion is in capital improvements, and about $28 billion is in M&O ‚Äì which is maintenance and operation.‚Äù\n\nThe trend is untenable as more American schools cross the half-century mark.\n\nEven with regular maintenance, ‚Äúabout 50 years is a good place to (consider) replacing a school.‚Äù Pickens said.\n\nBut funding sources vary widely, and it can be hard to secure money for school improvements without raising taxes.\n\n‚ÄúEvery state handles school facility improvements a little differently,‚Äù said John Heim, executive director of the National School Boards Association. But ‚Äúit usually comes from property taxes.‚Äù\n\nAnd that can put already-disadvantaged students in a more dire situation.\n\n‚ÄúIt affects poor districts or those that have lower tax bases more than it does wealthier districts that have more tax base to call on,‚Äù Heim said.\n\n‚ÄúAnd so as things get more expensive, you‚Äôre going to see that gap continue to grow.‚Äù\n\nAs schools deteriorate, so do teachers‚Äô and students‚Äô performance\n\nAt Reading Memorial High School in Massachusetts, a longtime teacher runs up to seven fans in his classroom to try to compensate for the school‚Äôs lack of air conditioning.\n\nBut those efforts don‚Äôt prevent him or his students from fading as the day gets hotter.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get the same caliber of work from them as I do during those cooler months when they‚Äôre actually comfortable,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúI find myself adjusting my lessons as the day goes on because I know I‚Äôm not going to have the energy or mental capacity to do what I did earlier in the day because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\nThe temperature in his classroom can reach 100 degrees, and the humidity can make you ‚Äúslip on the floor,‚Äù the teacher said.\n\nThat‚Äôs especially problematic because he has an autoimmune disease and has suffered dizzy spells that have forced him to leave the classroom to splash cold water on his face, he said.\n\nHVAC preventative maintenance has been completed at all Reading Public Schools, the district said.\n\n‚ÄúWe are committed to ensuring high quality air ventilation in all of our classrooms,‚Äù Superintendent Thomas Milaschewski told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe district ‚Äúwill continue to encourage staff to open windows, as feasible, to increase air flow in classrooms, and to bring students outside when weather permits,‚Äù the superintendent wrote.\n\nBut that brings little comfort to the veteran high school teacher ‚Äì especially because the building‚Äôs central and main offices are air-conditioned, he said.\n\n‚ÄúI cannot think of many professions where people have graduate degrees or have a license where they would tolerate something like this,‚Äù the teacher said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand where the disconnect is, where you want your teachers to be the best that they can possibly be but you‚Äôre not even making them comfortable.‚Äù\n\nKids miss entire school days because some buildings don‚Äôt have heat\n\nWhile nonexistent air conditioning can hinder students at the beginning and end of the school year, the opposite problem can have even greater consequences.\n\n‚ÄúWe tend to have to close schools down more for heating issues than for cooling issues,‚Äù said Washington, the Baltimore school district COO. ‚ÄúWintertime goes from December all the way up until March.‚Äù\n\nBaltimore teachers have reported classrooms as cold as 40 degrees. More than a third of the schools‚Äô boilers are over 20 years old. Some pipes were installed when Harry Truman was President.\n\nBeyond that, one elementary school had no running water for more than two weeks last winter, according to a school district memo.\n\n‚ÄúThe district is severely underfunded,‚Äù Washington said.\n\n‚ÄúBaltimore‚Äôs already taxed at a higher rate than the surrounding counties,‚Äù she said. But ‚ÄúBaltimore city has a low tax base. We have a disproportionate share of households that live below the poverty line. And so if we‚Äôre just depending on property taxes, we might not get there at all.‚Äù\n\nShe hopes the state will increase funding for Baltimore city schools ‚Äúso that we won‚Äôt continue to have the infrastructure challenges that we‚Äôre having.‚Äù\n\nIf not, Washington said, ‚ÄúI cannot guarantee that our students will have the learning environments that they deserve and that they need to be successful.‚Äù\n\nWhy this year may be even more challenging\n\nFallout from the pandemic could make infrastructure problems harder to fix this year, Pickens said.\n\nSome school districts haven‚Äôt been able to complete projects due to supply chain shortages or an increase in the cost of raw materials, he said. And remote or hybrid learning during the pandemic means some parts of schools may have been neglected.\n\nA demonstrator in Columbus, Ohio, rallies in support of teachers at a Columbus Education Association protest in August. Barbara J. Perenic/Columbus Dispatch/USA Today Network\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had two years of less use than we had,‚Äù Pickens said. ‚ÄúAnd because students were not in buildings, we probably did not continue the maintenance and operation and capital improvements of those school buildings because students weren‚Äôt in them.‚Äù\n\nInflation this year could also be getting in the way of school improvements, Heim said.\n\n‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre talking about an improvement that was to be made for the 2022-2023 school year, that bid process probably would have taken place back in January, February,‚Äù Heim said.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when we were seeing those incredibly high building costs. And it‚Äôs also when we were experiencing all those supply chain issues. So ‚Ä¶ schools may not have been able to get the projects done in time or weren‚Äôt able to do as much because of the supply chain issues and inflation issues.‚Äù\n\nCockroaches make lunch a scary scene, teacher says\n\nSchools that aren‚Äôt well-maintained can attract unwelcome visitors. Around one school building, cockroaches have occupied corners, carpets, sinks and sticky glue insect traps, an Oakley, California, high school teacher said.\n\nThe bugs can be seen every day, inside and outside the school. They grow as long as 2 inches and seem to have multiplied after school resumed in-person learning last year, the teacher said.\n\nThe infestation at Freedom High School is so bad it inspired an Instagram account. The teacher verified the cockroach photos were taken at the school and shared some personal ones from the last week of August. The teacher submitted work orders about the cockroaches in recent years but didn‚Äôt report them directly to the administration, they said.\n\nDead cockroaches lie inside and outside a bug trap at Freedom High School in Oakley, California. Provided to CNN\n\nLiberty Union High School District Superintendent Eric Volta recognized Freedom High School in the social media photos, he said. The district sprays schools for pests quarterly, he said, and if there are additional needs, pest services are requested.\n\n‚ÄúWe fog, we spray, we bait, we trap. We do whatever we need to do to try to correct the issue,‚Äù Volta said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having triple-digit temperatures out here, and these things are coming up out of wherever they are just looking for water.‚Äù\n\nA big concern is cockroaches shed, leaving the teacher wary of eating in most places. Some students haven‚Äôt wanted school lunches because of the roaches, the teacher said.\n\nBut all kitchens and snack bars go through health inspections. So Volta is not worried about the pests in eating areas, he said.\n\n‚ÄúI guess this is something that probably most teachers deal with,‚Äù the teacher said.\n\nWhile cockroaches might not be in every school, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs these problems that you have that are constant, but that you just go on teaching and doing what you have to do, knowing that you almost have no control over the situation,‚Äù the teacher said.\n\n‚ÄúI can keep stepping on cockroaches and killing them, but there‚Äôs always more. The problem just sort of needs to be addressed instead of just putting Band-Aids on it.‚Äù\n\nThe consequences of inaction ‚Ä¶ and possible solutions\n\nAnd if America keeps underfunding public schools, the impact could last generations, said Mary Kusler, the National Education Association‚Äôs senior director for advocacy.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really setting up a continued structural imbalance between the haves and the have-nots ‚Ä¶ unless we step up and push to ensure that a child‚Äôs ZIP code does not determine the education they receive,‚Äù she said.\n\nIncreasing funding for school infrastructure would ‚Äúimprove a lot of things in our country, including putting out into the workforce a more vibrant and more educated workforce,‚Äù said Pickens, the director of the National Council on School Facilities.\n\n‚ÄúAlso, by improving schools, somebody has to do the work on a school building. We‚Äôre putting people to work. We‚Äôre getting taxes from those people, from the labor. We‚Äôre increasing jobs. All of those things are factors in providing funds for school buildings.‚Äù\n\nTeachers and supporters rally in 2019 in Annapolis, Maryland. Baltimore union members asked for fans to be donated to cool sweltering classrooms without air-conditioning. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIt‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest to ensure students in poorer communities have schools in which they can thrive ‚Äì even if local tax revenues aren‚Äôt as plush as those in wealthier communities, said Heim, the director of the National School Boards Association.\n\n‚ÄúI think it comes down to having good formulas that can compensate for that. I think states are reevaluating those all the time,‚Äù Heim said.\n\n‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs what it comes down to: affordability and helping those poorer districts with their facilities.‚Äù\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean wealthier school districts with state-of-the-art buildings should have anything taken away, Kusler said.\n\n‚ÄúThe issue isn‚Äôt that they deserve less. The issue is actually that all of our kids deserve more,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄúUltimately, we are about creating the next generation of leaders in this country.

And many of the nation‚Äôs grid operators are also not taking climate change into account in their planning, even as extreme weather becomes more frequent and more severe.\n\nAll of this suggests that more power outages are on the way, not only this summer but in the coming years as well.\n\nPower operators in the Central US, in their summer readiness report, have already predicted ‚Äúinsufficient firm resources to cover summer peak forecasts.‚Äù That assessment accounted for historical weather and the latest NOAA outlook that projects for more extreme weather this summer.\n\nBut energy experts tell CNN that some power grid operators are not considering how the climate crisis is changing our weather ‚Äî including more frequent extreme events ‚Äî and that is a problem if the intent is to build a reliable power grid.\n\n‚ÄúThe reality is the electricity system is old and a lot of the infrastructure was built before we started thinking about climate change,‚Äù said Romany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University‚Äôs Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not designed to withstand the impacts of climate change.‚Äù\n\nWebb says many power grid operators use historical weather to make investment decisions, rather than the more dire climate projections, simply because they want to avoid the possibility of financial loss for investing in what might happen versus what has already happened. She said it‚Äôs the wrong approach and it makes the grid vulnerable.\n\n‚ÄúWe have seen a reluctance on the part of many utilities to factor climate change into their planning processes because they say the science around climate change is too uncertain,‚Äù Webb said. ‚ÄúThe reality is we know climate change is happening, we know the impact it has in terms of more severe heatwaves, hurricanes, drought, and we know that all of those things affect the electricity system so ignoring those impacts just makes the problems worse.‚Äù\n\nMatjaz Krivic\n\nAn early heatwave knocked six power plants offline in Texas earlier this month. Residents were asked to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large appliances at peak times. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, in its seasonal reliability report, said the state‚Äôs power grid is prepared for the summer and has ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù power for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù summer conditions, based on average weather from 2006 to 2020.\n\nBut NOAA‚Äôs recently released summer outlook forecasts above average temperatures for every county in the nation.\n\n‚ÄúWe are continuing to design and site facilities based on historical weather patterns that we know in the age of climate change are not a good proxy for future conditions,‚Äù Webb told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if the agency is creating a blind spot for itself by not accounting for extreme weather predictions, an ERCOT spokesperson told CNN the report ‚Äúuses a scenario approach to illustrate a range of resource adequacy outcomes based on extreme system conditions, including some extreme weather scenarios.‚Äù\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC ‚Äî a regulating authority that oversees the health of the nation‚Äôs electrical infrastructure ‚Äî has a less optimistic projection.\n\nIn a recent seasonal reliability report, NERC placed Texas at ‚Äúelevated risk‚Äù for blackouts this summer. It also reported that while much of the nation will have adequate electricity this summer, several markets are at risk of energy emergencies.\n\nCalifornia grid operators in its summer reliability report also based its readiness analysis on ‚Äúthe most recent 20 years of historical weather data.‚Äù The report also notes the assessment ‚Äúdoes not fully reflect more extreme climate induced load and supply uncertainties.‚Äù\n\nCompounding the US power grid‚Äôs supply and demand problem is drought: NERC tells CNN there‚Äôs been a 2% loss of reliable hydropower from the nation‚Äôs power-producing dams. Add to that the rapid retirement of many coal power plants ‚Äî all while nearly everything from toothbrushes to cars are now electrified. Energy experts say adding more renewables into the mix will have the dual impact of cutting climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions but also increasing the nation‚Äôs power supply.\n\nPlan B\n\nOne Chicago neighborhood is already making plans for how to keep the lights, air conditioning and heat on when the larger grid fails.\n\nIn the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, solar panels dot the rooftop of a public housing complex. A short drive away, a a giant battery stores energy from the solar panels as well as natural gas generators, creating a micro grid. Ilinois-based energy company, Commonwealth Edison, is working with community members to make the neighborhood energy independent.\n\n‚ÄúWithout power we are talking about potential life-threatening situations, so this micro grid provides that backup to be able to deliver power even when the [main] grid isn‚Äôt there,‚Äù said Paul Pabst, an engineer for Commonwealth Edison.\n\nThe project is pending approval but once it‚Äôs operating, the micro grid can connect and share power with the main grid. In the event of a blackout, it can disconnect and operate independently, tapping its stored battery energy to power the homes, police station and hospital in the area for four hours.\n\nYami Newell is a Bronzeville resident and energy advocate. She has seen the cascading effects of an unreliable power grid in Chicago, a place that‚Äôs no stranger to weather-related outages from both extreme cold and extreme heat. Losing power in a heatwave can create a dangerous health situation, and for families on a fixed income, losing all of the food in their refrigerator can be financially devastating.\n\n‚ÄúAn energy crisis can become a public health crisis,‚Äù Newell told CNN. ‚ÄúIt can become a food crisis.‚Äù\n\nAs communities look for innovative ways to build a more resilient grid, Bronzeville is one possible blueprint. Until states build a more resilient power grid, climate change will force energy companies to continue to take emergency actions, like asking people to limit electricity use or forced rolling blackouts to manage the grid when supply can‚Äôt meet demand.", "authors": ["Ren√© Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/09/05/nhc-expects-hurricane-lee-could-it-impact-the-us-east-coast/70765575007/", "title": "Tropical Storm Lee forms in Atlantic: Is Lee going to hit Florida?", "text": "Latest updates Wednesday: Hurricane forecasters say Lee is strengthening\n\nTropical Storm Lee formed in the Atlantic Ocean far east of the United States on Tuesday afternoon and is expected to become a major hurricane, with winds approaching 150 mph by the weekend.\n\nThe question is where is it going? And could it impact the U.S.?\n\n\"Interests across the Caribbean and along the East Coast from Florida to Maine will need to pay close attention to this feature,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said. \"Depending on the path this system takes, the expected time frame for potential impacts to the United States and Atlantic Canada may be Sept. 13-16.\"\n\nLee, with 65 mph winds, is more than 1,200 miles east of the Caribbean islands, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane could bring impacts to the Leeward islands by the weekend, but it's too early to determine how close the storm could approach the islands, hurricane specialist Eric Blake, wrote in the center's 5 pm. Tuesday update.\n\nRapid intensification likely\n\n\"It is becoming a question of when and not if rapid intensification occurs with Lee,\" Blake said. The forecast now predicts Lee will become a Category 4, 140-mph hurricane by Saturday morning east of Puerto Rico and continue strengthening into a 145-mph storm by Sunday.\n\nA reduction in wind shear in its path along with warm ocean water of near 86 degrees will create favorable conditions for Lee to strengthen, Blake wrote, and several models call for higher winds than those in the center's new forecast. Wind shear tears apart developing storms, while warm water acts as fuel to power up storms.\n\nPrediction and timing of winds, as of 5 a.m. Wednesday:\n\n12 hours: 80 mph (Category 1)\n\n24 hours: 90 mph\n\n48 hours: 120 mph (Category 3)\n\n60 hours: 140 mph (Category 4)\n\n72 hours: 150 mph (Category 4)\n\n96 hours: 150 mph\n\n120 hours: 150 mph\n\nTrack forecast uncertain\n\nLatest indications suggest the storm track could vary across a wide swath spanning from the coast northward to eastern Canada, or even skirt away from the coast entirely, AccuWeather said.\n\nMany of the models forecasters use indicate the hurricane is likely to head northward in the Atlantic, but not all. Any bump westward in the track could be disastrous for the Atlantic Coast anywhere from Florida to Nova Scotia.\n\nWhile that thought is alarming, weather models show a deep trough of low pressure over the eastern U.S. next week, and that dip in the jet stream \"should turn Lee more to the north around this time next week,\" said Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based Weather Tiger.\n\n\"Unless something very weird happens, that northward movement should occur well east of Florida, and Lee does not look like a threat to the state,\" Truchelut said.\n\nAccording to Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman, \"a combination of factors will determine where the hurricane eventually goes\" as it makes its way across the Atlantic.\n\nT‚Äãhis includes how strong and expansive the Bermuda-Azores high-pressure area is at the time. \"This acts as a steering wheel for tropical waves, storms and hurricanes in the tropics,\" Erdman said. If the high is weaker, Lee may just recurve out to sea. If it's stronger, then the storm could impact the East Coast of the U.S., he said.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that Lee remains offshore, Truchelut said. \"But with Lee 10 or more days out, there is sufficient uncertainty in the forecast such that the Eastern Seaboard should keep close tabs on Lee, especially as it will be a strong hurricane.\"\n\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson scale?Breaking down the hurricane category scale\n\nHurricane center's forecast track:\n\nThe forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nTake a look at the spaghetti models\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nMost spaghetti models keep the storm north of the Caribbean. However, Bermuda could face a major hurricane next week.\n\nMore storms for US?Climate change could push more hurricanes toward US coasts, new study suggests\n\nDangerous impacts possible even if it stays offshore\n\nA National Weather Service forecast office in eastern North Carolina reminded residents Tuesday that \"even when tropical systems stay out to sea, there are still distant impacts locally (dangerous rip currents, large breaking waves, etc.).\"\n\nIn addition, the weather service said that \"every system that develops always serves as a reminder to finish general hurricane season preparations if you haven't already.\"\n\nHow is the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season stacking up?\n\nLee is the 12th named storm to form this season. If it does become a hurricane, it would be the season's fourth hurricane and third major hurricane.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces 14 named storms and seven hurricanes. Even before the season started, forecasters said 2023 was likely to be a busier-than-normal season, but in August they bumped up their predictions, calling for 14-21 named storms.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-thursday/index.html", "title": "More than half the US population awaits Christmas weekend under ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nNearly 177 million Americans ‚Äì or more than half the US population ‚Äì will await Christmas weekend under wind chill alerts as a major arctic blast plunges temperatures to dangerous levels in much of the country, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnd the snowiest part is yet to come as the perilous winter storm barrels east across the nation.\n\nA developing ‚Äúbomb cyclone‚Äù is set to unload heavy snow and blizzard conditions especially in the Midwest on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe cold air and storm are affecting nearly every state in some way: More than 200 million people coast-to-coast were under winter-weather alerts for snow or icy conditions Thursday evening, the weather service said.\n\nWind chill alerts are impacting people from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and from Washington state to Florida, with below-zero wind chills recorded as far south as Texas on Thursday morning and expected in the Southeast by Friday.\n\n‚ÄúLife-threatening wind chills over the Great Plains (will) overspread the eastern half of the nation by Friday,‚Äù the Weather Prediction Center said ‚Äì and wind chills below minus 50 degrees already have been reported in the past two days in parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nSome low temperature records were set Thursday morning in the West and South, and in some cases they dropped this week with record-breaking speed: Denver International Airport saw a 37-degree plunge over one hour Wednesday, preliminarily the biggest one-hour drop recorded there, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSnow, meanwhile, has been hitting parts of the West and is expected in the next two days across much of the country‚Äôs eastern half.\n\nA major snowstorm is shaping up for the Midwest and Great Lakes especially ‚Äì with widespread light to moderate snowfall ‚Äì but with powerful winds that may make for impossible travel conditions.\n\n‚ÄúHeavy snowfall rates‚Äù of 1 to 2 inches per hour, ‚Äúalong with wind gusts of over 50 mph will result in near-zero visibility and considerable blowing and drifting of snow,‚Äù the prediction center said.\n\nThe storm is expected to become a ‚Äúbomb cyclone‚Äù ‚Äì a rapidly strengthening storm that drops a certain amount of pressure within 24 hours ‚Äì Thursday evening into Friday, reaching the pressure equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane as it moves into the Great Lakes.

The winner of that inaugural Nissan GT Challenge was Spain‚Äôs Lucas Ordo√±ez, who raced successfully for a number of years.\n\nMardenborough says the biggest shock of winning was adjusting to the cutthroat world of racing. ‚ÄúI had the inexperience of youth, didn‚Äôt understand the politics, didn‚Äôt know about self-preservation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut to leave home to do something that brought me joy was easy.‚Äù\n\nDid Jann Mardenborough really come in third at Le Mans?\n\nIn 2013, Mardenborough and two other Nissan racers did place third in the LMP2 class at the iconic 24-hour race in France, which is a thematic high point in ‚ÄúGran Turismo.‚Äù\n\nThe real team consisted of Mardenborough; inaugural Gran Turismo contest winner Ordo√±ez; plus one racing veteran who did not come from the video game world, Michael Krumm.\n\nBut to make the movie more dramatic, the writers made the three Le Mans winners consist of Mardenborough and two of the fictional runners-up.\n\nThe victory still looms large. ‚ÄúTo this day, that (Le Mans) trophy is the only one in my room,‚Äù says Mardenborough, who today races largely in Japan. ‚ÄùBut it‚Äôs for third place. I feel there‚Äôs still unfinished business there. I‚Äôd still love to win it.‚Äù\n\nDid Jann Mardenborough almost die in a crash in Germany?\n\nIn 2015, a Nissan GT3 sportscar driven by Mardenborough got airborne and left the notoriously difficult and deadly N√ºrburgring track in Germany. A spectator died, and the driver was hospitalized.\n\n‚ÄúBecause it was all real, and someone died, we made sure the movie is very true to life in all the details,‚Äù says Mardenborough. ‚ÄúIt was a big turning point for my career, where it could have all ended, but didn‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nDid Archie Madekwe do his own stunt driving in ‚ÄòGran Turismo‚Äô?\n\nMardenborough was called in to do the racing scenes for the movie, which says ‚Äúopened me up to a how movies are made, which is thrilling.‚Äù\n\nMadekwe had only recently received his driver‚Äôs license and got a crash course in track driving with a professional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done, and honestly, I often would have to kind of throw up in the middle of shooting some of those scenes, the G-forces were that severe on my body,‚Äù says the 28-year-old actor. ‚ÄúBut doing that made me appreciate what drivers do. One mistake and things can go really wrong. There‚Äôs no reset button.‚Äù\n\nWas Jann Mardenborough‚Äôs father really a soccer player?\n\nHe's the son of British soccer player Steve Mardenborough, who played for a range of clubs. ‚ÄúGran Turismo‚Äù mines the often-tense relationship between Jann and his father (played by Djimon Hounsou) for some of its most powerful scenes.\n\nMardenborough says the tension wasn't contrived. When he announced to his father and soccer-crazed brother that he was applying for the GT Academy, ‚Äúmy father laughed, and they both just kept watching. My mother thought it was fantastic.‚Äù\n\nWhy does the actress playing Jann‚Äôs mother look familiar?\n\nLesley Mardenborough is played by Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, who will be recognized by fans of the Netflix Formula 1 racing docuseries ‚ÄúDrive to Survive.‚Äù\n\nHalliwell has a true motorsports connection. She's married to Christian Horner, one of series' stars and team principal for the currently dominant F1 team, Red Bull. He and Halliwell make frequent appearances in the series, both at the track and at their home in rural England.\n\nWhat cars do Jann Mardenborough and Archie Madekwe drive for real?\n\nMardenborough cherishes his 1990s dream car that he was finally able to afford, a 1995 Ferrari 456 GT in blue with cream leather. It‚Äôs a two-door car, but rare for a Ferrari in that it has back seats. ‚ÄúI like to joke that one day when I have a wife and family, I‚Äôll be able to tell them, look, it fits all of us, no need to sell it,‚Äù he says.\n\nMadekwe is still shopping for his first vehicle. While he likes the Nissan GT-R, a pivotal ‚ÄúGran Turismo‚Äù scene finds him and crew chief Jack Salter (a composite character played by David Harbour) returning to the N√ºrburgring in an exotic Porsche 911 GT3 RS. ‚ÄúGetting into that car, I thought, OK, wow, now I get it,‚Äù Madekwe says. ‚ÄúThat car made me a car fan.‚Äù", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/05/27/will-ferrell-john-madden-movie/70263377007/", "title": "Will Ferrell to play John Madden in movie about football legend", "text": "Will Ferrell is slated to star as John Madden in an upcoming movie about the Hall of Fame coach and broadcaster who also became famous for the football video game that bears his name, according to a Deadline report.\n\nThe movie, called \"Madden,\" will be produced by Amazon and MGM studios and directed by David O'Russell, a five-time Academy Award nominee, Deadline reports. The movie will be based on a Black List script by Cambron Clark, according to Deadline. This film is independent of another project about Madden's life that is reportedly in the works with Tom Brady as executive producer.\n\nThere is no indication when filming on \"Madden\" will start or when the movie will be released.\n\nFerrell has a long personal history with sports. The actor studied sports information at Southern California with hopes of becoming a sports broadcaster. He has made numerous appearances for Trojans football games and events.

The Hall of Fame coach-turned-broadcaster's life was explored in the \"All Madden\" documentary that originally aired on Christmas Day 2021, just three days before the football icon died at the age of 85. NFL Films also featured Madden in an \"A Football Life\" episode that originally aired in 2017. HBO Sports also aired a documentary in 2003 called \"Rebels of Oakland: The A's, the Raiders, the '70s\" that prominently featured Madden's Raiders teams.\n\nJohn Madden in movies\n\nMadden has appeared as himself in two football movies.\n\nMadden, the \"Madden Cruiser\" and a handful of mid-1990s NFL stars made a cameo in the 1994 movie \"Little Giants.\" Madden was impressed with a trick play called \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico.\"\n\nMadden, alongside his longtime broadcasting partner Pat Summerall, called the games of the fictional football team, the Washington Sentinels, in the 2000 movie \"The Replacements.\"\n\nWill Ferrell's ties to sports\n\nIn addition to starring in a number of sports-related movies, Ferrell is part-owner of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC, which won the MLS Cup in 2022. At his LAFC introductory press conference in January 2016, Ferrell said that he \"started playing soccer on the mean streets of Irvine,\" and that his wife was an all-conference soccer player at Pomona (Calif.) College and their three sons played soccer.\n\n\"To say soccer is a part of our lives is an understatement,\" said Ferrell, who also made an appearance at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil to pump up U.S. men's national soccer team fans.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Ferrell played in five spring training games at nine different positions for 10 different teams in Arizona for a \"Funny or Die\" special for charity. The one-day professional baseball experience was turned into a documentary, \"Ferrell Takes the Field.\"\n\nFerrell's first sports-related movie, \"Kicking & Screaming,\" was released in 2005. As Phil Weston, Ferrell's character takes on the duties of coaching a youth soccer team and eventually convinces Pro Football Hall of Fame player and Super Bowl-winning coach Mike Ditka to help. The relationship goes sour when Weston tells Ditka, \"now go get me a juice box.\"\n\n\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" came out in 2006, with Ferrell playing a NASCAR driver whose favorite catchphrase is \"if you ain't first, you're last.\"\n\nIn 2007, Ferrell played rabble-rousing figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels in \"Blades of Glory,\" in which Michaels teams with Jimmy MacElroy (played by Jon Heder) to form an all-male figure skating team. Fun fact: Starting this year in Canada, ice dance pairs can be comprised of same-sex skaters.\n\nIn the 2008 movie \"Semi-Pro,\" Ferrell played Jackie Moon, a owner/coach/player for the fictional ABA team, the Flint Tropics. In the movie, Ferrell's character trades a washing machine for Woody Harrelson's character, Ed Monix. During his 2015 baseball stint, Ferrell was traded to the Chicago Cubs by the Los Angeles Angels for a washing machine, according to Baseball Reference.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/02/13/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-redesign-how-backlash-made-character-better/4730593002/", "title": "'Sonic the Hedgehog' movie redesign: How backlash made Sonic ...", "text": "Sonic the Hedgehog, the beloved Sega video-game character with lightning speed, had to survive his harshest foe to make it to the big screen: Twitter.\n\nLike the very blue Genie in \"Aladdin\" and the freaky felines of \"Cats,\" Sonic sped right into a social media backlash of loathing from fans when the too-realistic computer-generated creation (with conspicuously human teeth) was unveiled in 2019's first trailer.\n\nRemarkably, director Jeff Fowler and Paramount Studios heard the criticism, delayed the film's release and retooled the pivotal character. The revised Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) reappeared in a November trailer to (gasp!) acclaim and will officially arrive in theaters Friday alongside humans Jim Carrey as the villainous Dr. Robotnik and James Marsden as Sonic's small-town cop sidekick.\n\n\"This is a big deal. 'Sonic' filmmakers learned you have to appease the hardcore fans,\" says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"The fans said, 'This is not the Sonic we know,' and amazingly, Paramount redid it. It looks like this will pay off as 'Sonic' is a near lock to win the weekend box office. This is the anti-'Cats' scenario.\"\n\nBoom! 'Sonic the Hedgehog':Defies video-game odds with a record $57M box office\n\nFans revolt over 'Sonic the Hedgehog':All anyone could see were those too-human teeth in the first trailer\n\nThe very public criticism has been painful but fruitful for the director.\n\n\"I would not wish this experience necessarily on anyone, even though, at the end of the day, I really love that we engaged the fan base. They felt heard by our response,\" Fowler says. \"Honest, one of my biggest sources of pride from this whole process was that the fans were able to be involved in this movie. They helped get us where this needed to be.\"\n\nFowler, director of the Oscar-nominated animated short \"Gopher Broke,\" was a fan of the \"Sonic\" video games, which have developed a passionate global following since their origins in 1991's Sega Genesis.\n\nBut unlike ABC's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series (1993-94) and other TV projects that followed, Fowler wanted to bring Sonic's simple blockhead-cartoon design into a live-action drama. He knew this would be difficult.\n\n\"When I had my first meeting about this movie, if you'd asked me the biggest challenge, I would have said figuring out how to interpret Sonic's design for a realistic setting, standing next to human characters,\" Fowler says. \"That was always going to be the trick.\"\n\nFowler and the visual effects team created a Sonic with realistic features ‚Äì eerily humanlike teeth, fingers, limbs and spiky fur, fans insisted. They made it very clear it was too real, with Twitter reviews that called the creation \"an abomination.\"\n\nThe immediate takeaway was obvious.\n\n\"We just went too far,\" Fowler says. \"There was just too much realism. We just lost what it was that fans loved about the character.\"\n\nDespite the Twitter pile-on, there was no time to wallow.\n\n\"I allowed myself about five to 10 minutes of pity and feeling sorry for myself,\" says Fowler, who tweeted out a message to fans on May 2 with the hashtag #gottafixfast. \"It was just such an overwhelming response that it was important to me that (outreach) happen very quickly.\"\n\nParamount pushed back the release date three months to February, and the filmmakers dove into redesigning Sonic.\n\n\"You have to figure out a way to work through it and every second counts. We knew that there was a way to solve this if we brought the right people together and did the right adjustments,\" Fowler says. \"There was some speculation that we had to redo the whole movie. That was very erroneous.\n\n\"Even though redesigning your main character at the point we were at was not necessarily ideal.\"\n\nFowler estimates two months were devoted to the overhaul and re-creation of the character to more closely resemble the video game ‚Äì with larger eyes, less obvious teeth, bouncier fur and a softer nose.\n\n\"It was really just pulling back on the realism but keeping that level of detail we felt the film needed for a vibrant, fully realized character,\" he says.\n\nSchwartz got a \"sneak peek\" at the new Sonic before the second trailer, and the voice actor's enthusiastic response was a relief to Fowler. But there was clearly suspense before going public.\n\nTo his relief, this time Twitter was positive. \"Just because you listened to criticism of the original trailer and put in all that work to make the improvements. I‚Äôll reward that! Count me in for opening weekend,\" wrote Twitter user @aaronthew.\n\n\"The second time is a charm,\" Fowler says.\n\nWith that hurdle overcome, Fowler is now looking ahead to whether \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" will be successful enough for a sequel, even a franchise, adding more characters from the video games like fox sidekick Tails and Knuckles the Echidna.\n\n\"There are so many more great characters to bring into the story if we're able,\" Fowler says. \"Nothing would bring me more happiness than getting another shot to tell more stories. Knock on wood, we would love to do more with the Sonic universe.\"\n\nHe's already learned the most important design lesson, the hard way.\n\n\"We have cracked the code,\" Fowler says. \"So now we have a guide to figuring out the rest of the characters.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/companies/2022/10/10/gun-interactive-studio-behind-friday-the-13th-game-based-in-kentucky/69508428007/", "title": "Friday the 13th video game maker Gun Interactive based in Kentucky", "text": "As a student at the University of Kentucky, it didn't matter if Wes Keltner was on campus, downtown, or at a bar, the only thing he could think about was the video game industry.\n\nKeltner, a native of Campbellsville, dreamed of working in the video game industry but believed it meant he'd need to leave his home state of Kentucky and head west to California.\n\n\"I couldn't look around me and know [the video game industry] could be done here\" at the time, Keltner said. \"I wanted to see myself in a business or in an idea and that was not available to me when I was in school [from 2001-2005]. There was nothing that was about video games.\"\n\nIn 2010, after five years of video game consulting work where companies like Electronic Arts, Activision and Microsoft, would fly Keltner out to play their games and critique them, he decided he would be the one to bring the video game industry to Kentucky. So he founded Gun Interactive, an indie video game design studio with a focus on the horror genre.\n\nThe 11-person company based in Lexington is best known for making the wildly-popular M-rated \"Friday the 13th: The Game,\" based on the 1980 film starring actor Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees, who terrorizes the teenagers of Camp Crystal Lake.\n\nTo date, the game has over 13 million registered players.\n\nYou may likeHow a $15M gift to Norton may very well transform diabetes care in Kentucky\n\n\"I didn't want to leave (Lexington), and I thought if I can pull this off here, I can do it anywhere,\" Keltner, the 43-year-old CEO and President of Gun Interactive, told the Courier Journal. \"It was kind of like choosing to make games on hard mode because there's not a lot of other game studios around here.\"\n\nKeltner combined his love for classic horror films and his passion for video games to create a new genre of games, a new style of play, and prove Kentucky can produce globally known video games.\n\nModeling interactive video games off 'Friday the 13th,' more horror films\n\nGun Interactive's niche and focus lie in nostalgic horror films.\n\n\"I look at stuff that's usually at least 30 years old,\" Keltner said.\n\nThe video game studio is currently working on turning the 1974 \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" film into a video game that has a targeted 2023 release date. It will be the studio's fifth game produced in 12 years.\n\nTo enhance the creative video game design process and make sure all employees understand the details of the film, Keltner and his team have the film on in the background all the time and \"re-watch the film twice a day.\"\n\nAs a company, Gun Interactive, Gun for short, is obsessed with details. While creating \"Friday the 13th: The Game,\" they brought in actors from the film, including Hodder, to model their character's movements. They also met with the film's director of cinematography to ensure the authenticity of the game matched the film.\n\n\"When you have the guy that's played Jason, and he's in there doing, crazy kills, it looks accurate,\" Keltner said. \"If you were to go watch the movie, and then look at the game, Jason moves just like the Jason does in the movie ‚Ä¶ it's because it's the same guy.\"\n\nWorking on a \"Friday the 13th\" video game, modeled after the cult-favorite movie, wasn't an accident. After creating their first two games, a mobile-only military game, and a small horror game, Keltner immediately started writing a design for a game he planned to call \"Summer Camp.\" After releasing some early sketches of the game design, which paid homage to slasher films, the rights holders to \"Friday the 13th\" contacted Keltner asking to turn the film into a game.\n\nYou may likeJefferson County ranks in top 3 wealthiest counties across Kentucky. See how it stacks up\n\nKeltner said his company has become well enough known that \"Hollywood comes to us.\" But the crew at Gun Interactive is highly selective on which projects they choose to take on. The time commitment to make a game from start to finish takes about three years.\n\nIn its 12-year tenure, Gun Interactive has turned down at least 12 other projects.\n\n‚ÄúIt's a big time investment. It's a big money investment,\" Keltner said. \"And just creatively, we know that's the only thing we're going to be doing.\"\n\n\"Friday the 13th: The Game\" launched in 2017 and can be found digitally on the Xbox or PlayStation store, the Nintendo Switch or Steam, a PC gaming software. The game can also be purchased at stores like Best Buy and Walmart.\n\nCurrently, the company plans to have ‚ÄúThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre‚Äù available on PC, on eighth and ninth generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and in stores. The game will not be available on Nintendo Switch. The newest game is expected to cost between $30-$40.\n\nKeltner and his team created \"Friday the 13th: The Game\" on a budget of less than $10 million, a fraction of what major video game studios spend on game creation.\n\n\"We made 'Friday the 13th' on a shoestring budget,\" Keltner said. \"Which is kind of ironic, because the first film was also made on a shoestring budget.\"\n\nKeltner said the average budget to bring a game to market is between $30 and $50 million and that doesn't include the cost for live operations, a period of time where teams work to fix any bugs or generate new content after release.\n\n‚ÄúWe're scrappy,\" Keltner said of Gun. \"We try to make the most with the smallest amount of money.\"\n\nMore:Want to break into Kentucky's growing video game industry? Here are 3 ways to get involved\n\nHow Gun developed a new asymmetrical multiplayer gaming genre\n\nThe release of \"Friday the 13th: The Game\" also introduced the world to a new gaming genre ‚Äï the asymmetrical multiplayer horror game. Unlike games like \"Call of Duty,\" where all players can have weapons and equal abilities, in an asymmetrical multiplayer game, players are not all equal. Some players, for example, are Jason Voorhees who has special abilities and others are camp counselors.\n\n\"Those games didn't really exist much before we came to the market,\" Keltner said. \"We helped co-invent an entirely new gaming genre.\"\n\nAnd even though Gun Interactive has helped pave new ground for the video game industry, Keltner said his company ‚Äúflies under the radar,\" and he sometimes struggles with attracting new talent when working in an industry primarily located on the other side of the country.\n\nLouisville restuarants:These 5 restaurants are set to open in October in the Louisville area\n\n\"It's a pretty big ask, whenever you try to get someone to pack up and move from some other state, but we've managed to do it and we've got members on our team that packed up (and) left their state to come here,\" Keltner said.\n\nJonathan Hale, a professor of art and digital media at the University of Pikeville, said gaming is one of the largest industries in the world and is very profitable. He believes having studios like Gun in the state allow the industry to continue to grow and provides opportunities for more people to join the video game world.\n\n\"Kentucky needs to attract studios and get some of that money coming into the state,\" Hale said. \"We need to train students to be able to get into this highly lucrative field.\"\n\nThat \"under the radar\" approach of Gun is partly by design. The video game industry has a dark side, Keltner said. Gamers have been known to make threats against companies like Gun after having a feature of a game changed or discontinued.\n\n\"It can be a very toxic and sometimes sort of scary job to have,\" Keltner said.\n\nThe FBI has even been involved a few times after Keltner‚Äôs company received shooting or death threats.\n\n\"We take every one of those threats very seriously, they get turned over to the feds. And then those people get investigated pretty quickly. So, it's never a smart thing to do,\" Keltner said.\n\nA new chapter for Kentucky's growing video game industry\n\nAs a state, Kentucky has opened its arms to the small business. Every investment dollar that has been put into Gun Interactive has come from Kentucky, with the majority of investors coming from the Louisville and Lexington area, Keltner said.\n\n\"We've never gone to California and met with venture capitalists,\" Keltner said.\n\nAnd he plans to keep it that way. For the Kentucky-grown Keltner, keeping investment dollars local has shown him that his home state believes in his dream of bringing the video game industry to Kentucky.\n\n\"I owe a lot to those people,\" Keltner said.\n\nYou may likeBrown-Forman moves into the rum market with purchase of premium spirits brand\n\nAs a pioneer of the industry in this state, Keltner has made it his personal mission to help the video gaming industry here grow. He has worked his connections at Sony and Microsoft to help smaller studios promote and grow their games and reach.\n\n\"There's not many of us,\" Keltner said. \"Part of me feels almost responsible for pushing that industry here.\"\n\nHe currently sits on the board of the Eastern Kentucky University gaming institute and at one point, was involved in casual conversation with the University of Kentucky's eSports Program.\n\nHale, a former adjunct professor at EKU for six years who was involved with the gaming institute, has seen the impact Keltner's studio has on students interested in gaming.\n\n\"Wes is very passionate about making games and Kentucky ... He is also very open to talking to students and helping with internships,\" Hale said. \"Being able to take students to studios and talk to game (developers) in person is priceless.\"\n\nAs Keltner continues to trailblaze the path to video game development in Kentucky, he always remembers being that young college student searching for his place.\n\n\"If anyone says anything about video games, I‚Äôll be there,\" Keltner said. \"I want the 19-year-old version of me that's walking around campus to hear they made 'Friday the 13th' in Lexington ‚Ä¶ I want them to know, you could do this too. You could start something here.\"\n\nContact reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on Twitter at @oliviamevans_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewed/2023/04/19/harry-potter-tv-series-max-everything-we-know-so-far/11687365002/", "title": "'Harry Potter' TV series on Max: Everything we know so far", "text": "‚Äî Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed‚Äôs editors.

The things that often make video games successful ‚Äì generic characters, simple plots, lots of violence ‚Äì often make movies dull and frustrating. And yet, filmmakers keep trying, this week with \"Uncharted\" (in theaters now).\n\nBut a few films stand out from the pack. We rounded up the best video-game films available to rent or stream.\n\nReview:Tom Holland's action-packed 'Uncharted' maps out a forgettable Indiana Jones knockoff\n\nIf you dig Indiana Jones-y action: 'Uncharted'\n\n\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" star Tom Holland plays baby-faced fortune hunter Nathan Drake in the adventure based on the popular PlayStation series. Nate seeks a lost treasure and faces crazy obstacles (such as free-falling on a car out of a cargo plane) alongside his wisecracking, untrustworthy partner Sully (Mark Wahlberg).\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you like fuzzy cartoon speedsters: 'Sonic the Hedgehog'\n\nMixing live action with animation, the 2020 comedy was a huge hit with all ages, mainly thanks to the fleet-footed, sneaker-clad title character voiced by Ben Schwartz. Also helping: Jim Carrey back to his over-the-top self as Sonic's mustache-twirling arch nemesis, Dr. Robotnik.\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+\n\nIf you love Angelina Jolie: ‚ÄòLara Croft: Tomb Raider‚Äô\n\nAlicia Vikander did her best in a poorly constructed film in the 2018 ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù adaptation, but there's no replacing Jolie's version of the character, which became a pop-culture touchstone in the early 2000s. Sure, the movie is hammy and the costume is, shall we say, less than practical, but Jolie is a magnetic presence and sells every inch of the two movies.\n\nWhere to watch: On-demand platforms including Apple TV and Amazon Prime\n\nHer get-strong plan:Here's how Alicia Vikander gained 12 pounds (of muscle) for 'Tomb Raider'\n\nIf you want a marathon: The ‚ÄòResident Evil‚Äô franchise\n\n‚ÄúResident Evil‚Äù is arguably the most successful video-game adaptation franchise, spawning seven sci-fi horror movies and turning Milla Jovovich into a star. The original 2001 film feels almost tame compared with the wild heights the later films would reach (in both story and CGI), while the 2021 movie \"Welcome to Raccoon City\" rebooted the series for a new generation.\n\nWhere to watch: On-demand platforms including Apple TV and Vudu\n\nIf you like great martial arts: ‚ÄòMortal Kombat‚Äô\n\nThese films don't try to be more than the premise of the super-popular game: A group of different fighters battling for the fate of the world. The first 1995 film was a simple yet strong effort, and the 2021 reboot upped the fantasy element with a bunch of over-the-top characters.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nIf you want to feel like you're watching a video game: ‚ÄòDoom‚Äô\n\nThere's no mistaking this 2005 film for anything but a video-game adaptation. It revels in using aspects of video-game storytelling in its visuals, including a scene that feels like a first-person shooter game. It also gets bonus points for being one of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's first feature films.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nRanked:Every Dwayne Johnson movie role (including Netflix's 'Red Notice')\n\nIf you enjoy the more ridiculous side of the genre: ‚ÄòPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time‚Äô\n\nOK, here's the thing: The 2010 action film starring Jake Gyllenhaal is not a great movie. It also came under criticism for whitewashing the cast. But it does have lush visuals, and it plays less like a video-game adaptation and more like a straight adventure film.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+\n\nIf you dig horror comedies: 'Werewolves Within'\n\nFrom an obscure multiplayer virtual-reality video game comes one of the best movie adaptations ever. A new-to-town park ranger (Sam Richardson) and a helpful mail woman (Milana Vayntrub) seek out the ferocious culprit murdering folks in a snowy Vermont village in an enjoyable whodunit that's part \"Clue,\" part \"The Howling.\"\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime, Apple TV\n\nOpinion:'Squid Game' proves why endless Hollywood remakes are bad for TV fans ‚Äì and for business", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/07/22/star-wars-jaws-titantic-hollywoods-high-grossing-films-inflation/1796847001/", "title": "Top 10 films at the box office when adjusted for inflation", "text": "Sarah Whitten\n\nCNBC\n\nAs ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame‚Äù has raced its way to and beyond the highest-grossing film record held by ‚ÄúAvatar,‚Äù questions have arisen about how Hollywood determines what movie is considered the biggest earner.\n\nAfter all, ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù was released in 2009, so wouldn‚Äôt a fairer comparison to 2019's ‚ÄúEndgame‚Äù be adjusted for inflation?\n\nWell, it‚Äôs not that simple.\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason the film industry doesn‚Äôt measure the success of modern movies against those of the past ‚Äì movie ticket inflation isn‚Äôt an exact science. There are so many factors behind what makes a movie a box-office success and those factors have changed since the earliest days of cinema.\n\nFrom Hollywood to Seoul:How #MeToo is upending Asian entertainment industries\n\nDisney bought Marvel for $4 billion:It‚Äôs made over $18 billion since\n\nFor one, consumers have many more choices of what to spend their money on when it comes to entertainment. Even if you exclude sporting events, concerts and at-home entertainment such as streaming services and video games, just the sheer number of options of what movie to see in theaters is so much larger than 50 years ago.\n\nFor that reason, a film like ‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù sold more than 200 million tickets over the course of its initial release and additional seven re-releases in the U.S. For comparison, Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúEndgame‚Äù sold around 94.8 million tickets domestically since its release in April.\n\nThe content of movies has also changed drastically. Three-hour dramas about the lives of Southerners during the Civil War wouldn‚Äôt be as popular in 2019 as they were in, say, 1939. So, it would be difficult to say with certainty that a film that thrived decades ago would still do so today.\n\nAnother major reason that Hollywood doesn‚Äôt adjust for inflation is the number of foreign markets films are now released in. Analysts would have to dive into each global market to determine the inflation rate in each country, a task that is nearly impossible considering most films are released in more than 100 markets during their initial run.\n\nStill, it‚Äôs an interesting exercise. So, CNBC contacted Comscore, a media measurement and analytics company, to work out how an adjusted figure could be determined. Paul Dergarabedian and his team devised a method wherein they divided the average ticket price for the year a film was released into the film‚Äôs gross to determine the estimated number of tickets the film would have sold. Of course, this gets tricky, especially considering so many high-grossing films are re-released long after their initial debut.\n\nFor instance, ‚ÄúSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs‚Äù was released in theaters in 1937, 1983, 1987 and 1993. So for these films, Comscore used the average ticket price for each of those different years and divided them into the gross for each re-release.\n\nTo be sure, this isn‚Äôt a perfect method. Average ticket prices are just that, an average. There‚Äôs no way to break down the price of IMAX screenings and 3D screenings, or pricing based on region.\n\nNot to mention, ticket prices vary by year. In 2017, the average ticket price was $8.97. In 2018, it was $9.11. This year, it is $9.01. So if this adjustment had been done last year, the numbers would have been significantly higher.\n\nThat being said, here are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the U.S. if Hollywood did adjust the box office, based on modern ticket prices:\n\n10. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937)\n\nEstimated admissions: 109 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $982 million\n\nSince 1937, ‚ÄúSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs‚Äù has garnered around $184.9 million at the domestic box office. The film was the first full-length animated feature from Disney.\n\nThe film has been re-released at least three times and made more money from those re-releases than it did from its initial 1937 release.\n\nComscore determined that since its debut, around 109 million tickets have been sold. At today‚Äôs average ticket price, the film would have made nearly $1 billion in the U.S.\n\n9. 'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nEstimated admissions: 116.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.04 billion\n\nOne of only six horror films to be nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, ‚ÄúThe Exorcist‚Äù has hauled in more than $232.9 million since its 1973 debut.\n\nThe film made the bulk of its money during its initial release. It was brought back to theaters in 2000 and 2010 with extended scenes.\n\nAdjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices, ‚ÄúThe Exorcist,‚Äù which sold an estimated 116.5 million tickets, would have made around $1.04 billion.\n\n8. 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 124.6 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.12 billion\n\nReleased only in 1965, ‚ÄúDoctor Zhivago‚Äù earned $112.1 million during its run in theaters and won five Academy Awards.\n\nIt‚Äôs estimated that around 124.6 million tickets were sold for the film. Adjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices, that would be around $1.12 billion at the box office.\n\n7. 'Jaws' (1975)\n\nEstimated admissions: 128 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.15 billion\n\nSteven Spielberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù was released in theaters in 1975 and earned $260 million. Like ‚ÄúThe Exorcist,‚Äù it is one of six horror movies to be nominated for best picture. It did not win the award, however.\n\nComscore estimates that around 128 million tickets were sold during the film‚Äôs run. Adjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.15 billion at the box office.\n\n6. 'The Ten Commandments' (1956)\n\nEstimated admissions: 131 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.18 billion\n\nThe 3-hour-and-40-minute feature debuted in 1956 and earned $65.5 million.\n\nThe iconic film, which featured famed actors Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses II, sold an estimated 131 million tickets during its run. Adjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.18 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n5. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nEstimated admissions: 143.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.29 billion\n\n‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù is regarded as one of the best films in industry history and is also one of the highest-grossing. Without adjusting for inflation, James Cameron‚Äôs masterpiece is the sixth highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the third-highest grossing film globally.\n\nThe film has been re-released twice in addition to its initial run, once in 3D and once to celebrate its 20th anniversary. During those runs, the film earned $658.6 million domestically.\n\nIt‚Äôs estimated that ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù sold around 143.5 million tickets. Adjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.29 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n4. 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' (1982)\n\nEstimated admissions: 147.9 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.33 billion\n\nThe four-time Academy Award-winning ‚ÄúE.T.‚Äù hauled in $434.9 million since it was first released in 1982. Although it was re-released twice, once in 1985 and once in 2002, the film made the bulk of its earnings during its debut.\n\n‚ÄúE.T.‚Äù sold an estimated 147.9 million tickets, which translated to around $1.33 billion in ticket sales using today‚Äôs average ticket price.\n\n3. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 157.2 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.41 billion\n\n‚ÄúThe Sound of Music‚Äù was released twice in theaters. Once was its 1965 debut, where it made the bulk of its $158.8 million haul in the U.S., the other was a 2018 re-release.\n\nComscore estimated that the film, which won five Academy Awards, sold around 157.2 million tickets. That is around $1.41 billion when adjusted for today‚Äôs ticket prices.\n\n2. 'Star Wars' (1977)\n\nEstimated admissions: 178.1 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.6 billion\n\n1977‚Ä≤s blockbuster ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù has been reissued at least twice since its initial debut and has earned $460.9 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nIn the last four decades, the film has sold an estimated 178.1 million tickets, which equates to around $1.6 billion at the modern domestic box office.\n\n1. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nEstimated admissions: 201 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.81 billion\n\n‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù has been re-released at least seven times since its initial debut in 1939, Comscore said. During that time, it has grossed around $203 million.\n\nHowever, its popularity has resulted in more than 201 million tickets being sold in the last 80 years. If all of those tickets had been bought today, the film would have grossed around $1.8 billion at the domestic box office.\n\n¬©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

He‚Äôs charted 22 No. 1 songs and won 14 Academy of Country Music Awards, including three consecutive trophies for Entertainer of the Year.\n\nHowever, he still wasn‚Äôt expecting his latest accolade ‚Äì The ACM Dick Clark Artist of the Decade. When Aldean is bestowed with the honor Sunday during the 54th ACM Awards, he‚Äôll be in rarefied air ‚Äì only George Strait (2008), Garth Brooks (1998), Alabama (1988), Loretta Lynn (1979) and Marty Robbins (1969) have won the award.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of a little surprised,‚Äù Aldean admitted. ‚ÄúI guess more so because this isn‚Äôt something they give out every year, so it wasn‚Äôt even on my radar. I look at all the artists out there, and I feel like a lot of them have had a pretty great decade so to be the one that everyone voted for, that is pretty special. I‚Äôm proud, excited and pretty blown away, a lot of different things.‚Äù\n\nAldean will perform with Florida Georgia Line as well as sing a medley of his hits during the 54th ACM Awards, which will air live from MGM Grand‚Äôs Garden Arena 7 p.m. Sunday on CBS. He‚Äôs the first artist to receive the ACM Dick Clark Artist of the Decade Award since it was posthumously named after the awards show‚Äôs former host and longtime producer Dick Clark.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, the Artist of the Decade Award is so special because as the name says ... it really takes a snapshot of who has been the biggest artist in the past 10 years,‚Äù Dick Clark‚Äôs son and current ACM Awards producer RAC Clark said. ‚ÄúChanging the name embraces my father‚Äôs participation in the ACM Awards. He was there for decades to help nurture it and take it along from being a late-night television show and being the host of it to getting it on NBC and then CBS. It just started as a little awards ceremony in the middle of Hollywood.‚Äù\n\nA decade of Jason Aldean\n\nAldean‚Äôs decade of radio domination started in 2009 with the release of his ‚ÄúWide Open‚Äù album. While the Georgia native had had previous hits including ‚ÄúAmarillo Sky,‚Äù ‚ÄúLaughed Until We Cried‚Äù and ‚ÄúJohnny Cash,‚Äù ‚ÄúWide Open‚Äù was home to ‚ÄúBig Green Tractor,‚Äù which is still Aldean‚Äôs longest-running No. 1 hit. The song‚Äôs success came as a surprise to the singer and he said he knew it was next level when he started hearing people use the suggestive track as their ring tone. His fast-talking smash ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Country‚Äù was from the same album and pushed the envelope in a different direction, giving fans the biggest nod at what was coming next ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Kinda Party.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat was the start of the decade for me and then with that next album, everything went nuts,‚Äù he said, referencing ‚ÄúMy Kinda Party,‚Äù which is also home to ‚ÄúDirt Road Anthem.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt that point, I think it was a hang-on-for-the-ride sort of deal. I just think back to going from being an opening act for people on the road to selling out stadiums. I wanted to sell out a club, you know what I mean? A stadium was really reaching.‚Äù\n\nBut he did sell out stadiums. Aldean packed UGA‚Äôs Sanford Stadium, Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, AT&T Stadium and Gillette Stadium among others.\n\nHe‚Äôs also quick to point out ‚Äì and take blame ‚Äì for the fact that his career path hasn‚Äôt been smooth. Choices he made in his personal life sometimes flung his name into headlines he‚Äôd rather forget. And when he was on stage during the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 that left 58 people dead, his life changed again. Aldean will never forget what happened that night, but he forged ahead to play shows and make new music for country fans.\n\n‚ÄúWhen things hit like that, it‚Äôs life-altering,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs the artist, we‚Äôre just trying to navigate the road. A lot of ways I feel like I‚Äôve grown up in this business and people have seen it first-hand.‚Äù\n\nOver the course of his career, Aldean said he‚Äôs learned that making compelling music trumps everything. Nowadays, every mistake ends up on social media until someone else makes a bigger faux pas, he explained. But once his album is out, he said the unimportant stuff falls away.\n\n‚ÄúThat was always my goal, to stay focused on what I do,‚Äù Aldean said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt change what I can‚Äôt change, but I can stay focused on making my records.‚Äù\n\nHe's proud of his work ‚Äì admittedly more so of some songs than others. Aldean loved ‚ÄúTattoos on This Town‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Kinda Party,‚Äù but said his rap-infused ‚ÄúDirt Road Anthem‚Äù initially made him nervous.\n\nMore:ACM Awards: Who will (and who should) win\n\nMore:Brandi Carlile abandoned country music out of fear. Now in its embrace, 'no one has hurt me yet.'\n\n‚ÄúI remember sitting in the studio with (producer Michael Knox) going, ‚ÄòMan, if we don‚Äôt do this just right ‚Ä¶ it could be huge, or it could be a disaster,‚Äù Aldean said. ‚ÄúIt was never a matter of, ‚ÄòWere we going to cut it?‚Äô But, it was, ‚ÄòHow do we make this work?‚Äô‚Äù\n\nWith more than 4 million copies sold since 2010, ‚ÄúDirt Road Anthem‚Äù is certified quadruple platinum.\n\n‚ÄúMy Kinda Party‚Äù and ‚ÄúNight Train,‚Äù Aldean said represent the best albums he can make. He feels the same way about 99 percent of his recent ‚ÄúRearview Town‚Äù and he said the album on which he‚Äôs currently working is shaping up to be just as strong.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to just have a few songs that are going to be a single and everything else is just alright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never know what the singles or going to be so if I‚Äôm going to cut 15 songs, I want 15 songs that I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòAny of these could be singles.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe recording process takes longer, he said, but it‚Äôs worth it.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like everything we learned in the first part of my career we‚Äôre putting to use now,‚Äù Aldean explained. ‚ÄúWe dialed everything that we do in more so than we have before.‚Äù", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/14/cma-awards-2019-winners-performers-recap-pick/4183662002/", "title": "The Pick: We've got everything you need to know from the CMA ...", "text": "So ... about that Kacey Musgraves and Willie Nelson duet (enter: heart-eyes emoji).

But when she accepted the award, she opted to remember the words of encouragement she'd received on her way up.\n\n\"I once had the pleasure of playing a tribute show for Mr. John Prine, and the next day he shook my hand and he said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre real good. You‚Äôre no Reba, but you're real good,' \" McBryde said, and the crowd laughed.\n\n\"I cherish those little moments that are like that ‚Äî that are truth and guidance from voices that we respect and admire.

Seven-year-old Chris Young bellowed Alan Jackson‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Rock the Jukebox‚Äù from the aisles of BI-LO in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, so his mother could find him between the cereal boxes and comic books. Dierks Bentley is convinced that Clint Black‚Äôs first five songs topped country radio airplay charts because of the frequency he called local country stations around his hometown of Phoenix to request them.\n\nThirty years ago, country music‚Äôs storied ‚ÄúClass of 1989‚Äù ‚Äî led by the meteoric rise of Brooks, Jackson, Black and Travis Tritt ‚Äî changed the face of one of America‚Äôs truest art forms, propelling country music to unprecedented commercial success and worldwide popularity. Jackson‚Äôs traditionalism, Tritt‚Äôs Southern rock swagger, Black‚Äôs refined twang and Brooks‚Äô everyman storytelling combined for a string of hits that would dominate charts for years to follow. Their distinctive voices and nuanced music ‚Äî at once undeniably modern and deeply rooted in the genre‚Äôs past ‚Äî showed the world there was more to country music than overalls and tobacco spit.\n\nThese men challenged the very standards by which country music was viewed, both within and beyond rural America. A generation later, they are the standard. Their legacy is still being written by a new crop of stars whose own music is directly influenced by the foursome.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you talk about them, and you look at all the songs that came out of those artists, you don‚Äôt get a much more indelible mark than any one of them, much less all ... of them,‚Äù said Young, a multiplatinum-selling country singer whose latest hit, ‚ÄúRaised on Country,‚Äù is about growing up listening to ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s country music. ‚ÄúEach one had their own lane, and they‚Äôre all Hall of Famers to me. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs another year that‚Äôs like that in the history of country music.‚Äù\n\nTogether, the men are responsible for 64 No. 1 country hits. Jackson delivered 26 chart-toppers, including ‚ÄúWhere Were You (When the World Stopped Turning).‚Äù Brooks, who went into semi-retirement from 2001 to 2014, has 20 No. 1 songs to his name, with pop culture crossovers ‚ÄúFriends in Low Places‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Dance‚Äù among them. The RIAA declared Brooks the best-selling solo albums artist of the century. Black earned 13 No. 1 hits, spanning from 1989‚Äôs ‚ÄúKillin‚Äô Time‚Äù to 1999‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen I Said I Do.‚Äù Tritt contributed five hits, including singalong ballads ‚ÄúHelp Me Hold On‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnymore.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was really special because you could see there was a renewed attraction to country music ‚Äî our kind of music ‚Äî that had not really existed before that,‚Äù Tritt said of 1989.\n\nFor country music, the excitement surrounding the Class of 1989 was not like anything that came before.\n\n‚ÄúI hate to compare it to The Beatles, but that‚Äôs what it felt like, and sometimes that‚Äôs frightening,‚Äù Black recalled. ‚ÄúWhen you get people in a crowd, sometimes someone wants a piece of your ear.‚Äù\n\nCountry music was at a crossroads\n\nThe Class of '89 came along at a pivotal moment for country music ‚Äî an era music critic and author Holly Gleason described as the ‚Äúcredibility scare of the late ‚Äô80s.‚Äù As is frequently the case in country music, different factions of the genre had opposing views on where it should stylistically be headed.\n\nThe outlaw movement of the 1970s and early 1980s, personified by the likes of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, had given way to the sweeping arrangements and softer pop country of Sylvia, Gary Morris and Restless Heart.\n\nLeft-of-center artists Steve Earle, Dwight Yoakam, k.d. lang and Lyle Lovett, among others, rebuked the heavy production with their own brand of alt-country that delved into strains of ‚Äò50s, ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s sub-genres.\n\nGarth: 'Randy Travis saved country music'\n\nAt the same time, another splinter group of artists was mounting a revival of traditional country music: plainspoken Texas cowboy George Strait, rodeo maven and two-step queen Reba McEntire, progressive hardcore honky-tonker John Anderson and fleet-fingered bluegrass crossover Ricky Skaggs. When a dancehall dishwasher named Randy Travis brought his North Carolina baritone to songs including ‚Äú1982‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn the Other Hand‚Äù in 1986, his ringing ache ignited the genre and paved the way for the Class of 1989.\n\n‚ÄúRandy Travis saved country music, in my opinion,‚Äù Brooks said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know of any artist who took a format and turned it 180 (degrees) back to where it came from and made it bigger than it was then. And thank God for guys like Skaggs and Strait who were there to hold the fort down with him.‚Äù\n\nIt was these artists ‚Äî Travis, Strait and company ‚Äî who most directly paved the way for the success of the Class of '89, three so-called \"hat acts\" and Tritt (who refused to cover his mullet with a Stetson).\n\nAlong with a return to traditional instruments and forms, the Class of '89 brought a new kind of sexuality to country music. Previously, adjectives no saucier than ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù were used to describe male country artists. But fans saw Black as a twinkle-eyed cowboy dream. Brooks was the scrappy, down-to-earth football star. And Jackson‚Äôs understated, classic approach elicited comparisons to a modern-day Hank Williams.\n\n‚ÄúDesirability brought the (median) age of (fans) down and introduced the idea of young, hormonal bliss,‚Äù said Gleason, who wrote the award-winning book ‚ÄúWoman Walk the Line: How the Women in Country Music Changed Our Lives.\"\n\n‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt love a cowboy?‚Äù she questioned. ‚ÄúAnd if Clint Black was the cowboy idol, Garth Brooks was the everyday hero. You knew he would take his hat off when your mom walked out on the porch.‚Äù\n\nBusting boundaries\n\nMusic industry veteran Joe Galante signed Black to his record deal with RCA Records 30 years ago. More important than the singers, their looks or even how many concert tickets they sold, he believes, is the quality of the songs they recorded. No one back then had crossover hits, Galante said.\n\nYet people outside country music fans heard these songs. And, they wanted more.\n\n‚ÄúThese were iconic country songs, but they were much bigger than the format,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the power of the singer, the power of the song and the power of the records they made. The first singles on these records were followed by bigger and bigger and bigger songs and they were on those albums. There was a catalyst that kept these records selling for years ‚Äî not for a year ‚Äî just because they had that kind of depth.‚Äù\n\nThe depth also came with a true individuality, Gleason notes.\n\n‚ÄúAcross that line of artists, they all have enough in common that you can put them on the same shelf, but they‚Äôre all individual enough to know which stuffed animal is which,‚Äù she explained.\n\nThe men launched their professional careers in 1989, but it took a couple of years to pick up momentum. As the singers climbed, Nielsen in 1991 implemented SoundScan, a tool that for the first time accurately counted album sales. (Before SoundScan, sales data was tabulated by weekly calls to record shops.)\n\nThe indisputable numbers proved country music resonated well outside of rural America.\n\nRevelations about this music‚Äôs vast appeal led to television performances that grew country music‚Äôs popularity at an even greater pace. The heightened national exposure led to new consensus that country music resonated with fans coast to coast.\n\n‚ÄúThat was really the first time ‚Äî especially with Garth ‚Äî that people stood up and said, ‚ÄòHoly s--t, you guys in Nashville really are selling records. You‚Äôre doing real numbers,' ‚Äù Galante recalled.\n\nThe Class of '89 was part of a larger movement\n\nWhile Brooks, Black, Jackson and Tritt are the Class of '89‚Äôs superlatives, they weren‚Äôt the only singers to break through the genre that year. Vince Gill and Mary Chapin Carpenter were already familiar faces on Music Row, each having released albums to limited commercial fanfare. But it was in 1989 that Gill cemented his place in the genre with ‚ÄúWhen I Call Your Name,‚Äù a lonesome piano ballad with the hook ‚Äúnobody answers when I call your name.‚Äù Carpenter, an Ivy League educated folk-country singer from New Jersey, was also coming into her own in 1989 with ‚ÄúNever Had It So Good‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuittin‚Äô Time.‚Äù\n\nHowever, it's a 1990 performance on the CMA Awards that viewers still remember. Carpenter was dressed in a loose periwinkle pantsuit ‚Äî sans appliques and rhinestones ‚Äî and sang about the perils of being an opening act.\n\n‚ÄúIn 2¬Ω minutes with that cute Chapin smile, it was like, 'Boom! Mary Chapin Carpenter is a factor,‚Äô ‚Äù Gleason remembers.\n\nCountry singer Carly Pearce added: ‚ÄúI grew up loving Mary Chapin Carpenter and just how out of the box she was. She was a little left of center. She wasn‚Äôt about glitz and glamour. She just had her own little edgy thing, which I think is powerful and is something I don‚Äôt feel we have right now.‚Äù\n\nKeith Whitley didn‚Äôt have his breakthrough moment in 1989 ‚Äî that came in 1985 with ‚ÄúMiami, My Amy.‚Äù But when today‚Äôs country singers, including Young and Michael Ray, talk about the year, Whitley inevitably comes up. In 1988 his success heightened with his album ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Close Your Eyes.‚Äù Whitley‚Äôs unexpected and untimely death in 1989 combined with the collection‚Äôs popular self-titled track and other hits ‚ÄúWhen You Say Nothing at All‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm No Stranger to the Rain‚Äù ‚Äî the Country Music Association‚Äôs single of the year ‚Äî made the Kentucky baritone an enduring force in the genre.\n\n‚ÄúIn my opinion, you don‚Äôt get a better country voice than Keith Whitley,‚Äù Ray said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll look back on 1989 as the year that changed it all. They‚Äôre the class that opened so many doors for us as artists now. Thirty years later, we‚Äôre still reaping the benefits.‚Äù\n\n'Dude quake' sent shock waves well into the '90s\n\nAs Travis was the precursor to the Class of 1989, Black, Brooks and Jackson led to what Gleason calls the ‚Äúdude quake‚Äù that started in the '90s ‚Äî artists such as Shelton, Kenny Chesney, Billy Ray Cyrus, Joe Diffie, Brooks & Dunn and, to some extent, Tim McGraw.\n\n‚ÄúThe dude quake was about dudes who went to the church of boys will be boys, but they never forgot what girls liked and girls were never an appendage,‚Äù Gleason said. ‚ÄúTo quote Kenny (Chesney), ‚ÄòOur hearts still skipped a beat when those girls shimmied off their old cutoffs.‚Äô Those boys were highly attuned to the fact that it‚Äôs fun to go mudding in your truck, but nothing is as fun as skinny-dipping with some girl. And, it was a world of equally balanced dualities.‚Äù\n\nThose themes further engaged young audiences that still buoy the format. Country music historian and author Robert Oermann believes today‚Äôs country music following is one of the Class of ‚Äô89's most important legacies.\n\n‚ÄúThat was a huge moment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had youth acts before and we had youth acts after, but that was the first explosion. In order to sell the numbers they did, they had to attract people who buy albums, and that‚Äôs youth. We‚Äôve had that youth audience since then.‚Äù\n\nWhat country music hasn‚Äôt consistently had, Oermann added, was the authenticity delivered by Brooks, Black, Tritt and especially Jackson.\n\n‚ÄúMusic Row forgets over and over again their core mission,‚Äù he explained. ‚Äú(Country music executives) are like, ‚ÄòOh, people really like that. They really like country music.‚Äô It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre watching a circus parade and they (forgot the elephants). Then they go back to making pop s--t.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/12/21/kt-oslin-country-music-artist-80-s-ladies-dies/3994797001/", "title": "K.T.

Oermann (via Music Row).\n\nOslin had been staying in an assisted-living facility since 2016. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, but \"it is unclear whether this contributed to her death on Monday morning,\" Oermann said.\n\nOslin was 45 when the self-penned \"80s Ladies\" made her a country star. It was an inspired introduction, and a song that was intertwined with her own story as an artist.\n\n\"We were the girls of the 50s,\" she sang. \"Stoned rock and rollers in the 60s/\n\nAnd more than our names got changed/ As the 70s slipped on by/ Now we're 80s ladies/ There ain't been much these ladies ain't tried.\"\n\nA string of country hits followed over the next three years, including the chart-toppers \"Do Ya,\" \"I'll Always Come Back,\" \"Hold Me\" and \"Come Next Monday.\" In 1988, she became the first female songwriter to win the CMA Award for Song of the Year.\n\nIn 2018, she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. At the announcement press conference, she said it was \"wonderful\" to be recognized by the songwriting community, and \"especially now.\"\n\n\"I've been stricken with Parkinson's disease,\" she said from the podium. \"Half the universe seems like they're getting it. So this is special.\"\n\nMust-read list:What are the all-time greatest country songs?

Despite the late-night air continuing to cool after evening rainfall, there was no shortage of heat on the stage.\n\nThe hitmaker and CMA Fest TV special host had the crowd singing along to several songs, including \"I Hold On\" and \"Drunk on a Plane.\"\n\n\"There's gonna be some people really hurting at the airport tomorrow morning,\" Bentley said as he introduced the nearly 10-year old hit. Fans still knew every word.\n\nThe applause didn't run out of steam for Bentley's triumphant exit. The band lined up, arms around each other to stand for a moment, basking it in.\n\nAshley McBryde's star-making surge continues\n\nAshley McBryde's excellent 30-minute set was kicked off with her calmly stating \"Hi, I'm Ashley, these are my guys, and we're gonna sing some songs we made up.\"\n\nSuch overwhelming humility was okay five years ago when her stardom was emerging after her breakout hit \"Girl Goin' Nowhere.\" However, her critically-acclaimed 2022 album \"Ashley McBryde presents: Lindeville\" will be followed by her September 8 release \"The Devil I Know.\"\n\n\"I used to play in bars when I was 19,\" McBryde said introducing her forthcoming album's title track.\n\n\"Thanks, it's working out. I would tell my parents they weren't bars and tell the bars I wasn't 19. I could tell you the story but I'd rather just sing it.\"\n\nMcBryde concluded her foot-stomping set with a kiss blown to the crowd at the end of 2020 hit \"One Night Standards.\"\n\nAlabama receive roaring CMA Fest ovation, receive CMA's Pinnacle Award\n\nAfter over 50 years together and having been the first country music artists to regularly play football stadiums, Alabama completed their Sunday night set at Nissan Stadium and were presented the CMA's Pinnacle Award.\n\nVia the organization's website, the award \"recognizes a country artist who has undeniably redefined the pinnacle of success in the genre by achieving prominence through concert performances, consumption numbers, record sales, and/or other significant industry achievements at levels unique for country music.\"\n\nThe band's 50 No. 1 hits and seven platinum albums and hits including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1988) established them as a group Jason Aldean referred to as \"The Beatles of country music\" in pre-show comments on Saturday evening at CMA Fest.\n\nThe award -- not intended to be given annually -- has also been received by Garth Brooks in 2005, Taylor Swift in 2013 and in 2016 by Kenny Chesney.\n\nMoved to tears by the honor, band members Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry mentioned their recently deceased original member (and cousin) Jeff Cook, who died in November 2022.\n\nJosh Turner's traditional country vibes bring CMA Fest back after an extended storm delay\n\nJosh Turner's earnest baritone voice is beloved in the annals of country music's history because of its ability to seemingly both simultaneously fall from the heavens and weave its way into listeners' souls.\n\nThus, after a five-hour musical delay, his songs \"Why Don't We Just Dance,\" \"Your Man\" and \"Long Black Train\" were ideal to replace the rain that had fallen from Nashville's skies.\n\nEach of the offerings were met with wild applause.\n\nWhat Turner himself always self-effacingly calls \"old-timey\" traditional country, folk and gospel vibes that recall Hank Williams and other stars who existed in the genre prior to the age of color television were just what the CMA Fest crowd needed to comfortably ease back into the core reason for their attendance in Nissan Stadium this weekend.\n\nNissan Stadium gates to open at 7:30 p.m.\n\nCMA Fest officials announced that Nissan Stadium gates would open at 7:30 p.m. The show will start at approximately 8:15 p.m.\n\n\"Thank you for your patience,\" the message said. \"We can't wait to celebrate the final night of our milestone 50th anniversary celebration.\"\n\nLady A play Spotify House as fans hunker down\n\nClosing out four days of live performances from some of country‚Äôs biggest stars, Lady A took to Ole Reds Spotify House stage Sunday evening.

CMA Fest had not yet announced when gates would open as of 5 p.m.\n\nAny fans outside near the stadium or downtown were asked to take shelter. \"We expect strong winds & lightning for a least the next hour and a half with this next round of thunderstorms,\" read a statement from CMA's twitter account.\n\nFans find music while sheltering from weather threat\n\nShortly after the announcement that outdoor stages would not reopen for the evening, fans packed into Ole Red‚Äôs Spotify House to see Kimberly Perry, the CMA Fest‚Äôs 50th Anniversary Surprise Performance.Perry, formerly of the Band Perry, rocked the stage, singing a number of songs, including her hit song ‚ÄúIf I Die Young,‚Äù played with a newer, darker beat that sent fans wild.\n\nPlenty of festival goers were still milling about on Lower Broadway as lightning strikes split the clouds and thunder roared overhead.

They were asked to find an open business or to go to the center as lightning threatened the area.\n\nMore:Strong to severe storms expected Sunday; CMA Fest stages closed due to lightning\n\nDavid Morris brings a different sound to the Reverb Stage\n\nThe camo pants, Garth brooks t-shirt wearing country rapper David Morris got the reverb Stage crowd in a frenzy with his \"Small town queen.\"\n\nMorris brought a different sound, fusing his classic country sounds with a modern pop twist. Morris played to the crowd of more than 100, asking where everyone was from. Shouts of Kentucky, Boston and Nova Scotia Canada rang out as the crowd howled.\n\nMorris' \"Dutton Ranch freestyle\" song pushed Morris to No. 12 on Billboard's emerging artists and No. 3 in digital country sales.\n\nMegan Moroney draw a crowd to Riverfront Stage\n\nMegan Moroney took the stage at Riverfront, with a heavy crowd filling the park.\n\nDespite rain clouds gathering on the horizon, attendees were undeterred as they sang and danced along with the Georgia native‚Äôs song ‚ÄúI'm not pretty.\"\n\nMoroney, who released her first album last month, told the crowd the inspiration behind her song ‚ÄúSleep on my side,‚Äù came from a former cheating boyfriend.‚ÄúI just blocked his ass and wrote this song,‚Äù she said, laughing.\n\nIn honor of her first album release, Moroney payed homage to one of her biggest inspirations‚ÄîTaylor Swift‚Äîand one of her first songs: \"Picture to Burn.\"\n\nWynona Judd, Trisha Yearwood talk grief, growth at CMA Fest\n\nAn at-capacity crowd greeted country music queen Wynona Judd--the CMA Fest 2023 Artist of the Day on Sunday-- as she joined Trisha Yearwood on the Fan Fair stage at Music City Center.\n\nWith the flow of longtime friends, Judd and Yearwood spoke on a number of topics, from grief to growth and everything in between.\n\n‚ÄúI sometimes felt irrelevant, and wondered ‚ÄòDoes anyone still care?‚Äô‚Äù Judd asked, the crowd interrupting her with thunderous applause.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what keeps me going,‚Äù she said with emotion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here all these years because of you. The fans really saved me. You gave me purpose‚Ä¶you‚Äôre my family. You really are. You‚Äôre not just ‚Äòfans.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe two discussed mentoring rising young women in the entertainment scene, remarking on the love they have for them.\n\n‚ÄúNever let them tell you who you are,‚Äù Judd recounted telling a number of them. ‚ÄúI just felt love like a grandmother for them.‚Äù\n\nThough, Yearwood added, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let anyone tell us that we have less to offer just because we aren‚Äôt in our twenties,‚Äù she said, laughing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a hot flash right now.‚Äù\n\nJudd also mentioned--to riotous response--that she's working on a new album that's \"a little bit sassy, a little bit sweet,\" that'll likely involve Yearwood. She remarked that she's \"at a place in my life\" where she doesn't want to \"just be ‚Äòcountry.‚Äô\n\n\"I want to be country and everything,\" she said, referencing country artists who have grown and evolved through many genres, like Taylor Swift. \"I‚Äôm looking into what it feels like to be free. I believe you can do it all.‚Äù\n\nIn the final moments of the show, the two went on to harmonize for the crowd, leaving no doubt in the already-bewitched crowd who the queens of country are.\n\nTanner Adell: A mix between Shania and Beyonce?\n\nSwitching from a guitar to a bango, Tanner Adell tells the crowd not to be afraid to let the music move them.\"Our music is meant to move,\" she said\n\nFans proclaimed the artist as Shaniyonce, a blend of Shania Twain and Beyonce.The pop country artist has gendered more than 6.3 million streams from viral hit \"Love you a little bit.\"\n\nBlessing Offor takes the crowd to church\n\nIt was fitting Blessing Offor played the Vibes Stage on Sunday morning, because he took a crowd in Nashville to church.\n\nThe Nigerian-born singer moved to Connecticut when he was 10. The blind singer tickled the ivories on his keyboard, belting out a Sunday-appropriate song called \"Tin Roof.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I pray heaven is like Rain on a tin roof.\"\n\nPhones were in the air, the crowd swaying with the soulful music from Offor, making it the perfect sermon to open Sunday at CMA Fest.\n\nChristian Paul performs first CMA show day after wedding\n\nFor Tai Wossilek, Sunday was a vibe.\n\nWossilek paid extra attention to Christian Paul, a Jacksonville, Florida, native and Christian country artist who played the first show at the Vibes Stage.\n\nPaul addressed the crowd and shouted at Wosilek. The two married Saturday.\n\nBut have no fear, Paul will not be in the doghouse for playing a show a day after the two's nuptials.\n\n\"I actually encouraged him to play today, and it was amazing,\" Wossilek said.\n\nChase Matthew wakes up the Sunday crowd at Riverfront Stage\n\nFans gathered early and spread out on the lawn in the last of the mornings shade.One by one members of Chase Matthew's band trickled out onto stage under the back drop of heavy bass drums when he burst out into stage dancing and swinging his mic stand around and asking the fans to cheer along and participate in his songs.‚ÄúTake your hats off if you love America,‚Äù he said as he burst into his songs ‚ÄúI love you always‚Äù followed up by ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Country.\"\n\nMust-see sets on CMA Fest Day 4\n\n10 a.m. - 11 a.m.\n\nRiverfront Stage: Nashville area native Chase Matthew is a high school dropout who has polished more custom classic car hoods and repaired more pickup truck engines than he's written country songs. However, he's also the descendant of four generations of preachers. \"What would a church service be like if the preacher got worked up and said damn a little more? Like a preacher, my job is to make sure that you leave my concert better than when you arrived,\" Matthew told The Tennessean. He has a new album coming, entitled \"Come Get Your Memory.\" \"County Line\" was his streaming-favored breakout and still deserves a listen.\n\n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\n\nReverb Stage: Tanner Adell is an adopted ex-Mormon transplanted from Kentucky to Manhattan Beach, California. That alone would make for a tremendous countrified fish out of water story. Add in her Tik-Tok acclaim and Adell arrives at CMA Fest as ‚Äî if you're a digital-first fanatic of the genre ‚Äî one of the weekend's most must-see artists. Her single \"FU-150?\" It sounds exactly like you'd expect ‚Äî one listen, and it'll get stuck in your head all day long.\n\n1 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.\n\nReverb Stage: Enter any Music Row watering hole, mention the name of Big Loud-signed singer-songwriter Lauren Watkins and watch people's eyes alight with excitement. Her song \"Camel Blues\" revives cigarette smoking in the genre's female hard-luck heartbreak narratives. At the same time, \"Shirley Temple\" is a warning against believing the artist to be \"sweet and simple.\" More than anything, Watkins' set could be the weekend's most \"remember them when\" moments of the festival overall.\n\n2:30 p.m. - 5 p.m.\n\nRiverfront Stage: Ingrid Andress follows in a line of pop-ready female singer-songwriters who have experienced sustainable success in country music. \"Wishful Drinking,\" \"Lady Like\" and \"More Hearts Than Mine\" are unmistakably country because of the stories they tell. Though she lacks Southern vocal intonations, Andress' music ‚Äî for the more progressive-minded listener in your CMA Fest party crew, will be greatly enjoyed as a slight breeze blows in off the Cumberland River during a heated afternoon\n\nFor more must see acts click here.\n\nWeather forecast for Sunday at CMA Fest\n\nThe severe weather outlook has once again increased. The National Weather Service has classified most of Middle Tennessee, including Nashville, at an enhanced risk (3 of 5) for storms Today.\n\nThe main threats include: frequent lightning, damaging wind gusts and hail up to a quarter size is possible.\n\nAccording to the NWS, the majority of the threatening storms will hit between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.\n\nWeather shelters are located at:\n\nMusic City Center Garage (6th Avenue between Demonbreun & Korean Veterans Blvd)\n\nMusic City Center (during operational hours only; 201 Rep. John Lewis Way)\n\nBridgestone Arena (501 Broadway)\n\nHilton Hotel Underground Parking Garage (121 4th Avenue South)\n\n222 Garage (222 1st Ave. S.)\n\nIf you are unable to get to one of these safe shelters, proceed to the nearest business for cover.\n\nLittle Big Town's harmonies excite euphoric CMA Fest crowd\n\nAt various points during their CMA Fest set, tinges of Fleetwood Mac's rock and The Staple Singers' gospel blended- with Little Big Town's own two decades of fanciful pop-country style to present the best overall set of CMA Fest 2023 so far.\n\n\"This is a big ole party tonight,\" stated Karen Fairchild. Then, she and Kimberly Schlapman started into 2010's \"Little White Church.\" On Saturday evening, their seasoned and more impassioned than usual stylings allowed the lyrics \"no more calling me baby / no more loving like crazy\" to hit with an elevated level of emotional impact.\n\nAs well, songs like \"Better Man\" and \"Girl Crush\" resonated more profoundly than usual. There's a talent that only the most vaunted artists have wherein they're able to tap into the spirit of the audience and invoke that vibe into their offering.\n\nAnd yes, their cheeky favorites like \"Boondocks,\" \"Pontoon\" and \"Wine, Beer, Whiskey\" were all present, too. In 2020's \"Wine, Beer, Whiskey\" in particular, the mid-track genre changes allowing the song to have its inherent catchiness particularly connected on a breezy Saturday evening.\n\nJason Aldean delivers his familiar brand of 'blue collar' hits\n\nNissan Stadium reached its evening capacity as 23-time country chart-topper Jason Aldean took the stage for the third night of festivities at CMA Fest.\n\n\"Tattoos on This Town\" and \"Fly Over States\" were his first two selections of the evening.\n\nSongs like the latter discussing \"square cornfields and wheat farms\" fall well in line with the \"blue collar values\" he told The Tennessean were key to his latest single \"Tough Crowd,\" (from his forthcoming eleventh album) which celebrates his fanbase being comprised of tattoo-sporting, \"hard workin' nine to fivers,\" plus \"good ol' boys in cowboy hats\" and soldiers returned from foreign wars.\n\nThe night crowd gave its first huge ovation to Aldean's 2010 single \"Dirt Road Anthem.\"\n\nThough not a rap anthem by any means, the crowd rhythmically spoke and sang along with words extolling what Aldean referred to as \"country a**\" values as he performed his breakout hit.\n\nElle King: country music super star, or impromptu wedding officiant?\n\nElle King loves love and given the opportunity she wanted to celebrate it the best way she could think ‚Äî marrying one couple and renewing the vows of another.\n\nPacked into the third floor of Acme Feed and Seed, King celebrated Indianapolis couple Katrina Robinson and Amy Strutton and Murfreesboro couple Carla and Jeff Loftus.\n\n\"I'm very happy for you guys. I love y'all. You give me hope,\" King said.\n\nThe ceremony, attended by hundreds of people, concluded with King singing \"Lucky\" from her new album \"Come get your wife\" which released in January.\n\nNashville pool party vibes with Dustin Lynch\n\n37-year-old eight-time country music chart-topper and Tullahoma, Tennessee native Dustin Lynch is an avid boater, surfer and wakeboarder. He's also fond of the music and influence of Kenny Chesney, plus has appeared at Luke Bryan's January-held \"Crash My Playa\" party in Quintana Roo, Mexico numerous times in the past decade.\n\nFinding him singing Jimmy Buffett's nearly half-century-old single \"Margaritaville\" on a stage overlooking the rooftop pool at downtown Nashville's Margaritaville Hotel on a Saturday afternoon during CMA Fest has a deeper significance, though.\n\nCountry music's pop-crossover potential is a hot topic in music industry--but that growth is not likely to occur on a festival stage. At CMA Fest, country music fans are typically more willing to sip a margarita, down a few shots of hard liquor, dip their toes in a pool and sing a pop classic more than anything else.\n\n\"I've done 'Pool Situation' parties for nine years at 'Crash My Playa,' then we had a successful Vegas takeover [in 2022],\" he said to The Tennessean. \"Nashville finally has the hotels and population willing to sustain [the 'Pool Situation'] concept -- I'd have probably done this a decade ago if I could [in Music City]. I think the time has arrived for this concept from an economic, cultural, social and music industry perspective.\"\n\nHis reason for ending the conversation? Little Big Town had arrived at the party and were prepared to perform their beloved, decade-old hit \"Pontoon.\"\n\n\"Mmmmm motorboatin',\" indeed.\n\nDreams realized at Willie Jones set\n\nCourtney Dabney has wanted to come to CMA Fest since was 13--and almost 20 years later, at 31, Dabney is realizing her dream at the Reverb Stage Friday afternoon.\"I had no money, I got a teaching job and saved,\" said Dabney, of Dallas, TX.\n\nDabney was among those in the crowd to see Willie Jones, a country music singer-songwriter from Louisiana, after her dad introduced her to his music.\n\nShe wasn't alone in her excitement--the fervor was palpable as audience members grooved and swayed with hands in the air, Bridgestone Arena glinting in the backdrop.\n\nJones rose to popularity after his role in season two of The X Factor, and promoted his upcoming album \"Something to Dance Too\" which debuts June 16, 2023.\n\n\"I love love, it nourishes the soul,\" he said, crooning to the crowd as he started singing the song \"Soul.\"\n\nBoot stompin' and hoof clompin': Metro Police keep the peace\n\nMetro Nashville Police Department officers deployed across the CMA Fest footprint -- on bikes, ATVs, motorcycles and horses -- to help keep the public safe throughout the weekend.\n\nJackson Dean thrills the crowd at Riverfront\n\nA sea of fans began to sway, shoulders moving, as 22-year-old \"Don't Come Lookin'\" singer Jackson Dean took the Riverfront Stage to perform a new song about dog named Carl.Boats surrounded the stage along the Cumberland River as one of country music's fastest-rising stars sang his song \"1971.\"\n\nRiverfront Stage at capacity\n\nRiverfront Stage is at capacity again, CMA Fest said.\n\nThe gates were closed shortly before 1:20 p.m. as Tenille Arts performed her set on the stage.\n\nThe gates will reopen as soon as the area clears out.\n\nFans head to food truck row for festival eats\n\nThe smell of smoked meat wafts through the air between Music City Center and the Country Music Hall of Fame, where more than a dozen food truck venders are keeping up with hungry and thirsty festivalgoers at CMA Fest, offering smoked meats and sweet treats.\n\nOfferings from Nashville‚Äôs Original Shaved Ice will keep you cool, and for a taste of the South, Music City Brisket offers a taste of smoked meats. Looking for something lighter? Try Califarmia, a farm-fresh California cuisine truck serving chips and guacamole.\n\nStaying hydrated and cooled off is important, and thanks to Franklin‚Äôs Fruit Tea, a Murfreesboro-based company, there is plenty of cool drink options. Owner Germayle Franklin said the truck will sell 250-300 gallons of drinks Saturday. The best seller? Liquid Gold, a small-batch blend of brewed black tea, oranges and lemons.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to get to CMA Fest for years, this is our first time here,‚Äù Franklin said.\n\nJim Branham, a Northern Kentucky native, said between music, he and his wife needed some barbeque and a desert: peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.\n\nLaura Veltz takes the stage for Songwriter Session\n\nLaura Veltz brought the humor to the Country Music Hall of Fame‚Äôs Songwriter Session. Grammy nominated Veltz has written songs for Maren Morris, Demi Lovato, Lady A, Kelly Clarkson and more.\n\nSinging ‚ÄúRich‚Äù, Veltz asked the audience ahead of time if they were familiar with Maren Morris‚Äô version. Despite more than a dozen people saying yes, when came time for the popular ‚Äúka-ching, ka-ching‚Äù line, no one took over the lyrics.\n\n‚ÄúCome on you guys,‚Äù Veltz said pausing the song to chuckle. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a fun fact, that‚Äôs actually me saying that line on the track. So maybe I‚Äôll set the tone and you can help me out.‚Äù\n\nThe audience got it right the second time.\n\nWhen asked by a fan why she doesn‚Äôt sing her own songs she gave a simple answer.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to ruin how much fun this is,‚Äù Veltz said. ‚ÄúBeing an artist is really hard work. I love to sing, and it's wonderful that I get to use that skill in the writing room.‚Äù\n\nK. Michelle aka Puddin gives first country music concert\n\nK. Michelle, aka Puddin, took festivalgoers to church thanking ‚ÄúHim for Jesus and my whiskey‚Äù before she launched into her single by the same name.\n\nThe Memphis born singer is transitioning from R&B to country music, with her first country music concert at Amp Stage at CMA Fest on Saturday. Before starting the next song on her set list, K. Michelle took a moment to represent her roots.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Tennessee girl, born and raised in Memphis,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe first tape I ever got was the Judd‚Äôs. They were the reason I wore my hair red and was dancing around.\"\n\nDarius Dennis came from Memphis to see K. Michelle -- and for Dennis, the concert means a little bit more: the singer is Dennis's godmother.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Dennis said of seeing his godmother's first country show.\n\nCountry fans travel to Nashville from far and wide\n\nShawn Searle traveled 2,600 miles from Newfoundland, Canada to CMA Fest especially for the festival's 50th anniversary event. This is Searle's second time attending.\n\nSearle started his day with a first-time visit to the Amp stage on Saturday. Ready for a day filled with country music, Searle told The Tennessean that he's looking forward to the Nissan stadium show tonight to watch his favorite artist, Eric Church.\n\nMust-see sets on CMA Fest Day 3\n\n12 p.m. to 1 p.m. at Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum: Songwriter Laura Veltz is the pen behind Grammy-nominated songs ‚ÄúBetter Than We Found It‚Äù (Maren Morris), ‚ÄúSpeechless‚Äù (Dan + Shay), and ‚ÄúThe Bones‚Äù (Morris). She's noteworthy because her songs are directly responsible for being a key engine ushering in country music's mainstream crossover growth. At this ticketed event, the Hall and Museum state that \"fans get a chance to meet the minds behind some of country music's biggest hits, as they share the stories behind their work in an intimate performance setting, with audience Q&A.\n\n2:30 to 3:30 p.m. at Riverfront Stage: Jackson Dean's voice is a hauntingly inviting instrument that is resonating impressively well of late with mainstream country fanbases. His crunching, heavy and outlaw rock-styled country track \"Don't Come Lookin'\" topped Billboard's Country Airplay charts before the close of 2022, while his album \"Greenbroke\" continues to wow audiences.\n\n3:30 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. at Vibes Stage: Kasey Tyndall's a mother of a newborn who described her best plan for success as \"running on adrenaline and Jesus\" to stardom in a recent Tennessean interview. Add in the prominent influences of Avril Lavigne, Joan Jett and Alison Krauss, plus Brantley Gilbert, Miranda Lambert and Keith Urban to develop the musical Venn diagram that you'll expect to hear in her set.\n\nMore:CMA Fest 2023: Five must-catch performers on Saturday's lineup\n\nWeather forecast for Day 3 of CMA Fest\n\nPrepare for more sunshine as we head into day 3 of country music‚Äôs biggest party. Today is forecast to be the hottest day of the festival, with a high of 89 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nLows will be around 69 degrees this evening with a breeze of 5 mph coming in from the south.\n\nAir quality is approaching unhealthy standards: the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has issued a Code Orange Health Advisory for the Nashville area, active through midnight Saturday.\n\nWhile the general public is not likely to be affected, those with respiratory diseases such as asthma should limit prolonged outdoor exertion, authorities say.\n\nMoving into Sunday there‚Äôs a chance of severe weather ‚Äì find everything you need to know on that below.\n\nMore:CMA Fest 2023: Here's what kind of weather to expect in Nashville\n\nJelly Roll, country's unlikely superstar, arrives on Nissan Stadium's 50-yard-line\n\nJelly Roll's redemptive journey from Nashville's social fringes and incarceration to the city's pinnacle stages reached CMA Fest, with announced appearance inside the NFL stadium where, for years, he was relegated to the cheap seats.\n\nThe rapper-turned-country star made his CMA Fest debut, performing his 2023 No. 1 hit \"Son of A Sinner\" and new radio single \"I Need A Favor\" on an elevated spot-lit stage on Nissan Stadium's 50-yard-line.\n\nThirty-four years after attending his first Fan Fair and 14 years after being released from prison, Jason DeFord sang country songs he wrote in front of over 50,000 people.\n\n\"It actually means a lot to me that the kids in the juvenile jail in Parking Lot A are gonna hear this,\" he told The Tennessean before his surprise appearance.\n\nOf the 40-plus times he's been in jail over 38 years of life, many have been in the corrections facility located next to the juvenile court located adjacent to Nissan Stadium.\n\n\"[My success] just keeps on going. I wake up every day with a dream, and before I'm out of bed, it's happening,\" he said of his impressive surge in national renown.\n\nMiranda Lambert's 'Something Bad' gets a surprise 'Sk8er Boi' update\n\nInstead of Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert had other ideas for a collaborative partner on the rendition of her 2014 single \"Something Bad\" she just performed at Nissan Stadium.\n\nCanadian pop superstar Avril Lavigne.\n\nThe \"Sk8er Boi\" singer at a country festival?\n\nIt's not that far-fetched.\n\nDuring 2022's ACM Honors, Shania Twain was celebrated by Lavigne and Kelsea Ballerini making guest appearances.\n\nAs far as the previously-mentioned \"Sk8er Boi?\" Instead of another Lambert hit, Lavigne sang a 90-second snippet of her two-decade-old mega-hit.\n\nAlongside Leon Bridges performing his new Lambert collaboration \"If You Were Mine\" with the ten-time chart-topper surprises continue to stun the capacity crowd in attendance at Nissan Stadium.\n\nReba McEntire joins Cody Johnson, shocking the crowd\n\nCody Johnson, the rodeo outlaw-turned-CMA-award-winning superstar, likely surprised many of the tens of thousands in attendance at Nissan Stadium.\n\nHowever, those well cognizant of (and also having lived) the Western-to-country tradition -- like his special guest Reba McEntire -- were in no way surprised that emerging star Johnson didn't make his CMA Fest debut on Lower Broadway, but rather a boat ride across the Cumberland River away.\n\nYes, Reba McEntire sang her 1986 classic \"Whoever's In New England\" with Johnson at Nissan Stadium. Her unannounced appearance on the CMA Fest stage drew a collective, piercing shriek from a genuinely shocked crowd. As one would expect, the crescendo build from Johnson's mournful drawl to McEntire's soulful shot made it a dynamic performance worthy of a jet-engine roar of a standing ovation.\n\nTanya Tucker's resurgence continues at Nissan Stadium\n\nTanya Tucker's re-emergence as a country superstar has arrived at Nissan Stadium, igniting the filling home of the Tennessee Titans with honky-tonk energy.\n\nShe's both played an early evening set highlighted by tracks from her just-released album \"Sweet Western Sound,\" plus classic songs like her 50-year-old smash \"Delta Dawn.\" Moreover, she joined both Lainey Wilson and Elle King to sing a version of her 1978 hit \"Texas ('Til I Die).\"\n\nWearing two different all-white outfits while performing, her style and flair proved timelessly entertaining.\n\nWhile not the same concept as riding a horse down Lower Broadway or at the Grand Ole Opry, she's still swept into yet another iconic Nashville locale.\n\nAnd at the end of a stirring version of Delta Dawn, the crowd treated Tucker to a lengthy ovation as loud as those usually reserved for the night's headlining act.\n\nFew medical issues as temperatures rise at CMA Fest\n\nIt's been a quiet day at the medical tent next to Riverfront Stage. Few heat-related incidents, a few skinned knees and a couple of medical transports due to cardiac issues.\n\nA Vanderbilt University Medical Center spokesperson said they are treating fewer guests compared to previous years.\n\nMadeline Edwards\n\nMadeline Edwards brought the funk to the Riverfront stage kicking off her set with a keytar in hand.\n\nPlaying to a hefty crowd, Edwards called out to all the lovers and ex-lovers in the crowd with her hits ‚ÄúPlayground‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeart you can‚Äôt break.‚Äù\n\nEdwards showed off her band‚Äôs range with Childish Gambino‚Äôs ‚ÄúRedbone,‚Äù before returning to her repertoire.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a song I wrote when I decided I didn‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs damn opinion of me besides mom, Dolly and Jesus,‚Äù Edwards said before launching into her song ‚ÄúMama, Dolly, Jesus.‚Äù\n\nFashion trends at CMA Fest\n\nFrom Riverfront to Fan Fair X, fans are sporting classic western wear looks ‚Äì fringe, cuttoff denim, ditsy floral tops and dresses, and turquoise and silver accessories ‚Äì and many are adding a glam twist.\n\n‚ÄúBling, bling, bling ‚Äì rhinestones, burned hats, and boots,‚Äù boutique business owner Millinean Lawrence told The Tennessean, of how she‚Äôd sum up this year‚Äôs CMA Fest fashion trends. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen across the board, but of course, here more than ever.‚Äù\n\nA Chapel Hart party is a Vibe\n\nAin‚Äôt no party like a Chapel Hart party, and this trio certainly worked the room.\n\nThe Mississippi-born band took the Vibes Stage at CMA Fest belting some of their songs while working in their versions of classics.\n\nSisters Danica and Devynn Hart and cousin Trea Swindle strutted across the stage singing their hit ‚ÄúThe Girls are Back in Town,‚Äù paying tribute to the greats of country music before them.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just out here representing for the dreamers,‚Äù Danica said thanking the fans for getting them as far as they‚Äôve come.\n\nNext Women of Country shines spotlight on emerging artists\n\nFive up-and-coming women artists performed a showcase and conversation at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum at midday Friday, as part of CMT‚Äôs Next Women of Country franchise.\n\nHosted by CMT executive Leslie Fram, artists Kimberly Kelly, Catie Offerman, MaRynn Taylor, Kasey Tyndall, and Julie Williams shared their origin stories and paths to success, as well as some new music.\n\n‚ÄúDo y‚Äôall know how fun it is to be backstage with a bunch of girls with guitars?‚Äù Fram said, welcoming the group to the stage.\n\nLainey Wilson and emerging artists play Nashville's Bell Tower\n\nLainey Wilson's growth from a hitch-trailer dwelling hopeful to a country music superstar is a well-known tale. However, her growth from country music superstar to an artist with a devoted fan club of thousands of die-hard, bell-bottom-clad fans is a tale that's emerging and worth telling.\n\nBefore playing her \"Bell Bottom Country\" album single \"Hillbilly Hippie\" to kick off a brief acoustic set with her bandmates, she told howMcBryde's support was invaluable at a critical career juncture. Noting that once she had the opportunity, via Tractor Supply and Opry Entertainment Group's support, to pay it forward -- she did.\n\nMother and daughter take Spotlight Stage\n\nMother, daughter team O.N.E the Duo took the Spotlight stage at Fan Fair X exuding love for each other and their music.\n\n‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to do this,‚Äù Prana Supreme Diggs said chuckling as she talked about how the duo came to be.\n\nMusic runs in their veins, and unexpectedly it‚Äôs country. Prana is the daughter of Tekitha, a vocalist and solo artist, and Wu-Tang‚Äôs RZA.\n\nThis is the second year the pair have been on the stage at CMA Fest. They sang songs from their debut album ‚ÄúBlood Harmony.‚Äù Their song ‚ÄúTil you called my name‚Äù reflects on the bonds between a mother and daughter.\n\nThe two will release their debut album \"Blood Harmony\" on August 11, with 12 tracks serving as a chapter reflecting the duo‚Äôs spirit, life and vision.\n\nDr. Pepper Amp Stage reaches capacity\n\nGates are closed as the Amp Stage reaches capacity ahead of Uncle Kracker's set at 12:30.\n\nReba McEntire shares new book\n\nAs Day Two of the Country Music Festival kicked off, a standing-room only crowd filled out the CMA Close Up Stage inside the Music City Center on Friday morning to see country music legend Reba McEntire.\n\nMcEntire shared stories from her forthcoming lifestyle book, \"Not That Fancy: Simple Lessons on Living, Loving, Eating, and Dusting Off Your Boots,\" which is set to release in October.\n\nRiverfront Stage reaches capacity\n\nRiverfront Stage reached capacity Friday as Parmalee heads to the stage to play a set at CMA Fest.\n\nThe modern country band blends contemporary sounds with classic country ingredients.\n\nBlock party: CMA Fest Day 2 kicks off\n\nThe lawn in front of Riverfront Stage was full Friday morning as Priscilla Block strutted the stage in a highlighter green bedazzled shirt and safety vest.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm very, very happy to be a part of CMA Fest at the riverfront stage,‚Äù Block said to applause from the audience.\n\nBlock got sentimental with the crowd.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotten to write with a lot of incredible songwriters in Nashville, but there is something, for me, just writing my diary with my guitar,‚Äù she said.\n\nLaunching into her ‚ÄúMe Pt. 2,‚Äù Block got raucous support from the audience.\n\nWeather forecast for CMA Fest Day 2\n\nBring your sunscreen for CMA Fest Day 2.\n\nThe National Weather Service Nashville forecasts a high of 85 degrees with sunny skies throughout the day.\n\nLows will sink throughout the night, dropping to around 79 degrees at 8 p.m. By 10 p.m. temperatures will drop to 71. A light breeze up to 5 mph will come from the northeast.\n\nMust-see sets for Day 2 at CMA Fest's Riverfront Stage:\n\n10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Riverfront Stage: Priscilla Block is currently, low-key one of the most compelling live performers in country music. She's gained renown for Tik-Tok acclaim and being an advocate for body positivity in the genre.\n\nis currently, low-key one of the most compelling live performers in country music. She's gained renown for Tik-Tok acclaim and being an advocate for body positivity in the genre. 1:45 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Riverfront Stage: A year after emerging past her \"ten-year-town\" angst at not achieving Music City stardom, now award-winning and Grammy-nominated, small-town Iowa-born country singer-songwriter Hailey Whitters has blended songs driven by homespun wisdom like \"Everything She Ain't\" alongside seasoned musicianship and entertainment flair to be on the cusp of breakout appeal. She's developed a passionate independent fanbase that, now that she's a staple of country radio, is only growing stronger. This performance should feel like you're being swept into an irrepressible tidal wave of support.\n\n4 p.m. to 5 p.m. Riverfront Stage: Warner-signed Madeline Edwards' jazz and pop-chord-inspired takes on rock-styled country sound unlike anything else in the genre. She's toured with Chris Stapleton, is a favorite of Elle King, is a former CMT Next Women of Country class member, plus appeared on the CMA Awards with Mickey Guyton and Brittney Spencer, plus CMT Music Awards with Alanis Morrissette. The Texan with California roots is a whirlwind of energy on stage and has a way of winning over fans whose ears and bodies are open to heavy, hard grooves.\n\nCMA Fest: Night one highlights by Marcus Dowling\n\nOutside of Chris Stapleton's trademark tenor, reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year Luke Combs has the type of voice that inspires rapt listening and a desire to learn his lyrics for peak screaming back to him on stadium stages.\n\nKick that into his cover of Tracy Chapman's classic \"Fast Car\" (a favorite since the 33-year-old performer was four and in his father's backseat) and two things are clear. First, Combs is a superstar. Second, he will likely remain as such for decades to come.\n\nThe crowd also erupted in joy when Darius Rucker popped up in the middle of Nissan Stadium's field-level crowd on an elevated platform stage with a guitar. Supported by a sparse, fiddle-led group, they led a sing-along favorites like \"Fires Don't Start Themselves\" and his cover of Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Wagon Wheel.\"\n\nLuke Combs' surprise duet\n\nIn the midst of a set that featured his current country and mainstream radio hit cover of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car,\" and country radio chart-topper \"The Kind Of Love We Make,\" the legitimacy of Luke Combs' talent as an interpreter, player, singer and writer of songs is unmistakable.\n\nThe reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year introduced Vince Gill for a surprise duet on \"One More Last Chance.\" While playing the song released almost 30 years ago, Combs felt like a doppelganger for the 2005 inductee to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn an interview before taking the stage, Gill noted that Combs was a longtime fan who sneaked into one of his concerts (Combs' first ever) when he was nine years old.\n\n\"Luke still owes me $40,\" joked Gill.\n\nJordan Davis takes it up a notch\n\n35-year-old Shreveport, Louisiana native Davis, on standby for the birth of his third child, took to the stage making his debut full-set appearance at Nissan Stadium as a CMA Fest. The crowd responded emphatically.\n\nThe multiple-time country radio chart-topper kicked things off with his 2022-released single \"That's What My World Spins Around.\" Davis' underdog success story of \"Buy Dirt,\" his anthemic song of love built around buying land, building a home and starting a family leading to his CMA Song of the Year victory has led to increased fandom, noted by the eruption of applause that occurred when he took to the stage.\n\n\"I moved to Nashville 12 years ago and the next thing you know, I'm standing in the endzone of Nissan Stadium at CMA Fest,\" stated Davis as playing his current top-ten hit \"Next Thing You Know\" yielded a smattering of cell phone lights in the venue's crowd.\n\nBefore closing with \"Buy Dirt,\" he saluted his faith in Jesus Christ, his life as a father and husband, and being the best friend he could be.\n\nHighlighting the previously-mentioned Luke Bryan collaboration he wrote with his brother Jacob, plus fellow brothers Josh and Matt Jenkins caused a grin to break out on his heavily-bearded face.\n\n\"This was the most memorable show I ever played,\" said Davis.\n\nBailey Zimmerman sings about heartbreak\n\nClosing out the Riverfront Stage on Thursday was 23-year-old breakout artist Bailey Zimmerman, who rocketed to fame with two top charting singles last year.\n\n‚ÄúMy name is Bailey Zimmerman and I sing about heartbreak, 24-7,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve written a few love songs, but found out that really wasn‚Äôt my thing.‚Äù\n\nZimmerman tossed his hat to a fan before closing out with with ‚ÄúRock and a Hard Place.‚Äù As the crowd sang along, he took off his shoes, one at a time, throwing them into the crowd‚Äîand even teased throwing his shirt into the crowd.\n\nAt capacity\n\nRiverfront Stage reached capacity as hundreds gathered to watch Bailey Zimmerman take the stage at 5:30 p.m.\n\nRelaxed atmosphere\n\nAt the Dr. Pepper Amp Stage, fans enjoyed a more relaxed atmosphere, spreading out in front of the stage on the grass and Adirondack chairs to sip on cold cans of strawberries and cream Dr. Pepper and enjoy the acts.\n\nAfter overcoming some sound system difficulties, Oklahoma-based band Ricochet performed some of their most popular numbers from their heyday.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna do some of our hits from the 90s‚Äîwhen most of you young ladies were in pull ups,‚Äù lead vocalist Heath Wright said to the primarily young crowd.\n\nWright also surprised viewers with a new song from the band‚Äôs first album in more than a decade, ‚ÄúSweet Tea.‚Äù\n\nCouple attends 10th CMA Fest\n\nMarcy and Jim Lindemann spoke with The Tennessean as they stood in the Music City Center, consulting a number of festival maps Thursday afternoon. The Fort Lauderdale couple have attended every CMA festival for the past ten years, and expressed their excitement to be here for the 50th anniversary.\n\n\"WE are having so much fun!\" Marcy said, while Jim nodded in agreement. \"We're really excited about having four nights of concerts.\"\n\nPillbox Patti brings unique stage presence\n\nOver at the Reverb stage, crowds gathered to listen to Pillbox Patti, the vivacious Nashville-based singer-songwriter with a provocative stage presence as she rocked through her biggest hits. Among her hit songs, the Florida native sang her newest single \"Low life\" to an exuberant crowd.\n\nMedical incidents minimal...so far\n\nThe medical tents, staffed by Vanderbilt University Medical Center Events Team, have had minimal visits four hours into the festival.\n\nAs temperatures increase in the coming days, heat related illnesses are sure to increase. For now though, staff plan to revel in the slow day.\n\nThe biggest medical need so far? Band-Aids.\n\nBlisters will be the downfall of anyone wearing \"their fancy new cowboy boots,\" staff said.\n\n\"We've given out so, so many Band-Aids for that,\" staff said.\n\n49 Winchester kicks off set at Spotify House\n\nAppalachian folk band 49 Winchester's lead singer Isaac Gibson heralded two kinds of music ‚Äî that which is traditionally and authentically country and Western ‚Äî were to reign supreme during CMA Fest's early afternoon offerings at Ole Red's Spotify House.\n\nPerhaps spurred by being in Nashville, the Americana Music Association Group of the Year-nominated act kicked off their set with \"Damn Darlin',\" a tale of heartbreak told with the \"Rock Block\"'s EXIT/IN as the backdrop. \"Russell County Line,\" another single, is a heart-warming hometown tale highlighting how closely the band straddles the intersections of country, rock and roots music.\n\nThe band's inclusion on the CMA Fest lineup at Spotify House is a tremendous showcase of the real-time interplay between a band that fans are discovering on streaming services (co-signs from ERNEST and Luke Combs aid that) and a group whose performance skills are so strong that they'll also gain fans from just providing a fantastic live experience.\n\nAlcohol sales 'innumerable'\n\nEmployees at the official alcohol stations say that the alcohol sales just at Riverfront stage are \"innumerable,\" making at least a thousand drinks sold by noon, with many thousands more expected by this evening.\n\nLauren Alaina keeps the good vibes going\n\nArtist Lauren Alaina took the stage at Riverfront Park to enthusiastic fans who sang alond to some of her biggest hits.\n\nAfter leading the crowd in unison for her song \"Road Less Traveled,\" the fervor ramped up as Alaina reminded attendees of her newest album, \"Unlocked,\" dropping tomorrow, June 9.\n\nCamden Keene stood on the lawn of Riverfront Park, overlooking the massive crowd gathered for artists like Lainey Wilson, Elvie Shane and Alaina. Keene, along with her family, traveled from North Carolina after planning this trip for over a year.\n\n\"We're so excited to finally be here,\" she said. \"We've enjoyed every artist we've seen so far, especially Lauren Alaina.

Oslin, Byron Hill, Wayne Kirkpatrick and Joe Melson.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see this one coming,‚Äù Dunn said of his induction. As one-half of Brooks and Dunn, he wrote some of the country duo‚Äôs biggest hits, including 1990s chart-toppers ‚ÄúNeon Moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Not the Cheatin‚Äô Kind.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThis is special. This is the one that‚Äôll kind of hang around after I‚Äôm gone.‚Äù\n\nOn the red carpet, he reminisced about the first time he heard one of his songs on the radio. While driving from Oklahoma to Nashville, Brooks and Dunn's debut single \"Brand New Man\" came on and he immediately had to pull his Ford Explorer to the side of the road.\n\nMelson, this year's inductee in the veteran songwriter category, knows the feeling. \"That's the biggest thrill, to hear your song on the radio,\" he said. He is known for his work with Roy Orbison, including the sweeping, soaring classics ‚ÄúOnly the Lonely,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrying‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue Bayou.‚Äù\n\nIt's \"Only the Lonely\" that Melson is proudest of: \"When I heard it, I thought, ‚ÄòYou know, that song might sell a couple hundred thousand copies‚Ä¶It went way beyond that. That sucker went all around the world.\"\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm just wowed by it all,‚Äù laughed veteran songwriter/artist inductee K.T. Oslin on the red carpet. ‚ÄúWhy am I here and how did I get here?‚Äù\n\nShe got there by writing hits like ‚Äú‚Äò80s Ladies‚Äù (which was named the 1988 CMA Song of the Year, making Oslin the first female songwriter to win that award), the Grammy-winning ‚ÄúHold Me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo Ya.‚Äù Her work has influenced singer-songwriters like Brandy Clark, who performed \"'80s Ladies\" in Oslin's honor at the gala.\n\nDuring the induction announcements in August, Oslin revealed that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. It has kept her from songwriting, but, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to get back to it very much.‚Äù\n\nFor Kirkpatrick, being tapped for the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame is \"the icing on an already big cake. Quite unexpected, but I'm so grateful.\" His songs have been played everywhere from Lower Broad to Broadway. His credits include songs recorded by Amy Grant (‚ÄúWise Up‚Äù) Michael Smith (‚ÄúPlace in This World‚Äù), Eric Clapton (‚ÄúChange the World‚Äù) and Little Big Town (‚ÄúBoondocks‚Äù).\n\nHe also co-wrote music and lyrics for the musical ‚ÄúSomething Rotten!‚Äù which debuted on Broadway in 2015, and is currently working on a musical version of the Robin Williams movie ‚ÄúMrs. Doubtfire‚Äù with his ‚ÄúSomething Rotten!‚Äù collaborators, brother Karey Kirkpatrick and John O‚ÄôFarrell.\n\n\n\nLike Kirkpatrick, Hill was inducted in the songwriter category. Since moving to Nashville in May 1978, the North Carolina native has co-written songs that have been recorded by George Jones (\"High Tech Redneck\"), George Strait (\"Fool Hearted Memory\") and Alabama (\"Born Country\"), and featured on the television show \"Nashville.\"\n\n‚ÄúThis is pretty amazing,\" Hill said before the gala. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty proud of the fact that I‚Äôm still here and I‚Äôm still doing it and I‚Äôm still loving it.

Not long after coming to town, she won first prize on the Nashville Network's talent competition \"You Can Be a Star.\"\n\n\"By the time I'd moved to Nashville, I'd been singing for so long, but I wasn't comfortable enough on the stage between songs,\" White told The Tennessean in 1994. \"So I started taking acting lessons.\"\n\nShe landed a number of parts in local productions before deciding to focus on her music again.\n\nMore:Lari White releases new album, plays Bluebird with husband\n\nIn the early 1990s, she got a job as a backup singer for Rodney Crowell. After RCA signed White to a record deal, she, Crowell and Steuart Smith co-produced her 1993 debut album, \"Lead Me Not.\" The album's most successful single, \"What a Woman Wants,\" peaked at No. 44 on the country charts.\n\nIt was White's next album, 1994's \"Wishes,\" that became her breakout release. Three singles from that project, \"That's My Baby,\" \"That's How You Know (When You're in Love)\" and \"Now I Know,\" were top 10 country hits, and the record was certified gold. That year, the Academy of Country Music nominated her for the Top New Female Vocalist Award.\n\nAfter her deal with RCA ended (her last release for the label was a greatest hits project in 1997), White continued to record, releasing \"Stepping Stone\" on Lyric Street Records in 1998 and a handful of projects on her own label, Skinny WhiteGirl. Her most recent release was the 2017 double EP \"Old Friends, New Loves.\"\n\nHer songs were recorded by Travis Tritt, Pat Green, Lonestar and many others. She co-produced Toby Keith's 2006 album \"White Trash with Money\" (making her one of the first and only women in country music to produce a major label act) and several songs on Billy Dean's \"Let Them Be Little.\"\n\nThree albums White contributed to, two volumes of \"Amazing Grace: A Salute to Country Gospel\" and the soundtrack for the film \"The Apostle,\" won Grammy Awards in the Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album category.\n\nWhite also continued to act.

He was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nWhile Penniman‚Äôs dynamic sound reached all corners of the globe, he also spent considerable time in Nashville at both ends of his 65-year career.\n\nIn the last decade, he split his time between his home in Lynchburg, Tenn., and a hotel on Nashville's Lower Broadway, overlooking his star on the Music City Walk of Fame.\n\nThough he rarely made public appearances, locals would spot him on occasion ‚Äì frequently in the drive-thrus of Wendy‚Äôs and other fast food restaurants on West End Avenue, where he‚Äôd give a friendly wave to fans.\n\nCharlie Daniels (Oct. 28, 1936 - July 6, 2020)\n\nBy the time the Charlie Daniels Band topped the charts with ‚ÄúThe Devil Went Down to Georgia‚Äù in 1979, the instrumentalist, singer and songwriter had long established a remarkable, multifaceted career in Nashville.

Today she ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nVice President Dick Cheney was a hero on Fox News twenty years ago, but his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is a villain on Fox today.\n\n‚ÄúThe voters are saying they‚Äôve had enough ‚Äì and that it‚Äôs time to bury the tragic Bush-Cheney era once and for all,‚Äù Fox‚Äôs 10 p.m. host Laura Ingraham said Tuesday night, around the same time Cheney conceded to Harriet Hageman in the GOP primary in Wyoming.\n\nCheney was a punching bag and punchline all across GOP-aligned media as the primary results came in. Many right-wing commentators repeated the same points they had made for months: That Cheney‚Äôs condemnation of former president Donald Trump and her collaboration with Democrats on the House select committee investigating January 6 made her an enemy.\n\nOn Fox, the tone was quite personal and bitter, and an extraordinary turn for a network that once celebrated the Cheney family dynasty. Back in 2012, Liz Cheney was even a paid Fox commentator. And when she left the network in 2013 to run for Senate in Wyoming, Sean Hannity endorsed her.\n\nBut she crossed Trump, and thus Fox‚Äôs biggest stars. On Tuesday night Tucker Carlson mocked her public stance in defense of democracy, which stemmed from Trump‚Äôs 2020 plot to overturn the election result, and derided media outlets that have taken her seriously. He predicted that she will soon ‚Äúbe writing a column for National Review and will be releasing a book from Simon and Schuster called ‚ÄòDemocracy.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nOne hour later, Hannity opened his show by calling Cheney ‚Äúthe most obsessive Trump hater in the country.‚Äù He pooh-poohed talk of a potential Cheney presidential run, saying that ‚Äúif she can‚Äôt win Wyoming, she‚Äôs not going to win any other red state that I can think of.‚Äù\n\nIn the 10 p.m. hour, Ingraham‚Äôs program showed about five minutes of Cheney‚Äôs concession speech, then cut away to guests who ridiculed Cheney. CNN and MSNBC aired the speech in full.\n\nFox‚Äôs coverage did include Cheney telling supporters that she could have easily won the primary ‚Äì ‚Äúthe path was clear‚Äù ‚Äì but ‚Äúit would‚Äôve required that I go along with President Trump‚Äôs lie about the 2020 election. It would‚Äôve required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system and attack the foundations of our republic. That was a path I could not and would not take.‚Äù\n\nNewsmax did not show any of Cheney‚Äôs speech. Instead, 10 p.m. host celebrated the fact that ‚ÄúLiz Cheney is gone.‚Äù\n\nNumerous right-wing commentators portrayed Hageman‚Äôs win and Cheney‚Äôs loss as a perfect example of democracy in action, implying that it undermines Cheney‚Äôs warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nBut unlike Trump, Cheney didn‚Äôt deny that she lost the race, or encourage people to believe she won, or incite supporters to block Hageman‚Äôs victory from being certified.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the ‚ÄúReliable Sources‚Äù newsletter.

Kay Ivey‚Äôs statewide order to wear face coverings in public places to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin entered the order following a hearing. Real estate agent Debbie Mathis and retired sheriff‚Äôs Deputies Larry Lewis and Barry Munza, all of Jackson County, filed the lawsuit against Ivey, State Health Officer Scott Harris and the State Board of Health. The lawsuit contends that the mask order was illegally adopted and that the plaintiffs face deprivation of liberty anytime they interact with others. On July 15, Ivey announced a requirement for face coverings to be worn by anyone older than age 6 who‚Äôs in public and within 6 feet of someone who‚Äôs not a relative. The rule makes exceptions for people who have certain medical conditions, are exercising or are performing certain types of jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A crew member on a state ferry tested positive for the coronavirus, which caused a cancellation of the service in Southeast Alaska. The Alaska Marine Highway System said the planned run of the ferry M/V LeConte in Lynn Canal near Juneau was canceled Sunday after the diagnosis was obtained. The highway system, which is part of the state Department of Transportation, said the crew member recently returned home after a two-week rotation on the LeConte. It was not immediately clear when the crew member was tested. Ferries spokesman Sam Dapcevich said state transportation officials were notified Saturday that a ferry worker had the coronavirus. No close contacts with the infected crew member were identified in Juneau or on the ferry, and no specific testing or quarantine recommendations were made for crew or passengers, the marine highway service said.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma: A massive testing blitz is underway in Yuma County, with elected leaders and health officials aiming to administer up to 10,000 free COVID-19 tests by the end of the week. The county remains a hot spot for the new coronavirus in Arizona, with infection rates double the state average, even as the number of reported daily cases has decreased significantly. Yuma County teamed up with Yuma city officials and the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to set up the testing blitz, which started Tuesday. The blitz goes until Saturday and will take place at the parking lot of the Yuma Civic Center, one of the larger venues in the region that is able to accommodate the massive drive-in project. ‚ÄúOur numbers are going in the right direction. Now is the time to move forward even harder so we can get a strong foothold, as opposed to starting to let up because the numbers are starting to go our way,‚Äù Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday reported 383 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 11 more deaths from COVID-19, the illness it causes. The Department of Health said at least 50,411 people have tested positive for the virus. Of those, 6,847 cases are now active, meaning they do not include those who have died or recovered. The Arkansas COVID-19 death toll has risen to 566, but the number of people hospitalized with the illness has decreased by one to 507. Arkansas Education Secretary Johnny Key also announced that the state will begin releasing numbers of total and active cases within a school district‚Äôs population. Key said the numbers will help districts as they prepare to reopen schools later this month. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has stood by plans to reopen schools for in-person instruction, despite opposition from teachers‚Äô and pediatricians‚Äô groups.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The state‚Äôs second-largest school district has announced stricter reopening guidelines than California at large, and officials say that ‚Äúit will be a matter of months ‚Äì not weeks, not days‚Äù ‚Äì before students can return to campus. San Diego Unified School District made the decision Monday after health experts from the University of California, San Diego wrote in a report this week that the district should adopt stricter measures than those being enforced by the state, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the mistakes that have been made in other places ‚Ä¶ because they made an arbitrary decision that wasn‚Äôt really based on science,‚Äù School Board President John Lee Evans said in a virtual news conference. San Diego Unified now says schools won‚Äôt reopen until there are fewer than seven community outbreaks over a weeklong period. Currently, there are 24.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has extended an executive order requiring property owners in the state to give tenants a 30-day notice before pursuing evictions as individuals struggle to make payments during the pandemic. Previously, property owners would only give 10 days‚Äô notice. Polis announced the extension Monday, hours before it was set to expire, The Denver Post reports. It is now set to expire in a month. Many residents ‚Äúcontinue to experience substantial loss of income as a result of business closures and layoffs, hindering their ability to keep up with their rent payments through no fault of their own,‚Äù Polis said. Several studies have shown hundreds of thousands of Colorado residents could be at risk of eviction as unemployment remains near-record levels. Associations representing property owners have insisted evictions won‚Äôt happen on a major scale because there are strong incentives to keep tenants housed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state‚Äôs acting public health commissioner was asked Tuesday to consider significantly expanding visitation rules at nursing homes and chronic disease hospitals. In a letter sent to Dr. Deirdre Gifford, a coalition of 12 advocacy groups said guidance from the Department of Public Health issued June 22 that allowed only outdoor visits ‚Äúunduly excludes people with disabilities‚Äù and those with mobility issues. Also, they said the order has been implemented ‚Äúrestrictively,‚Äù allowing only 20-minute maximum visits. ‚ÄúLife in a nursing home is isolating. When residents are further isolated by losing contact with those they love and depend on for their social and emotional needs, the results can be fatal,‚Äù the organizations warned. The advocates agreed that nursing homes could impose ‚Äúa reasonable COVID-19 testing requirement on visitors‚Äù wanting to see loved ones.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state will not regularly announce positive COVID-19 cases in schools and will instead do so on a case-by-case basis, public health officials said Tuesday. It will also not require teachers and staff to undergo testing before the school year begins. ‚ÄúThere may be times when there‚Äôs really no need for the public to know,‚Äù said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the state Division of Public Health. ‚ÄúFor example, if a person was positive, but no one else would have been considered exposed, that‚Äôs unlikely to be made public.‚Äù The state announced last week its intent to test all teachers and staff before the start of the school year. But the state can‚Äôt force school staff to get tested. That will be up to districts, said A.J. Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs highly encouraged, we‚Äôll put it that way,‚Äù Schall said. ‚ÄúThe districts are the ones that employ the teachers.‚Äù\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Amid widespread protests and unrest over the police killings of Black Americans, a national commemoration of the 1963 civil rights March on Washington is being reconfigured to comply with coronavirus protocols in D.C. Although many marchers will arrive via charter buses from surrounding communities Aug. 28, the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the organizers, will ask some to join satellite marches planned in states that are considered hot spots for COVID-19. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre following protocol,‚Äù Sharpton told the Associated Press. All participants will be required to wear masks, Sharpton said. Organizers also will provide hand sanitizing stations and conduct temperature checks throughout the event. The revised plan appears to avoid a potentially awkward face-off with Mayor Muriel Bowser‚Äôs government over COVID-19 restrictions in the nation‚Äôs capital.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing for college football to be played as scheduled this fall, saying Tuesday that canceling the season as some conferences are doing because of the coronavirus will put the players at more risk outside the protective bubble provided by their teams. DeSantis made his remarks shortly after the state announced 277 more deaths, a one-day record that is likely misleading. Because of reporting lags, the state health department figures do not necessarily represent deaths in a 24-hour period. Tuesday numbers often include deaths not reported over the weekend. Dr. Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, said Tuesday‚Äôs total is not a reflection of what happened the previous day. ‚ÄúYou have deaths that may be going back more than a month that are just getting reported now,‚Äù she said, but the number does reflect the deadliness of the disease during its surge in the state in late June and July.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an argument that requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax. A lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter alleged the postage requirement is an unjustifiable burden on the right to vote. While voters can still cast ballots in person early or on Election Day, the lawsuit argued that the option of in-person voting ‚Äúdoes not really exist because of the pandemic‚Äù and is also nearly impossible for some elderly or disabled voters. Some voters don‚Äôt have stamps on hand and can‚Äôt get to the post office or don‚Äôt want to go there and risk exposure to coronavirus, the lawsuit said. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during a pandemic, but said its availability means the requirement is not tantamount to a poll tax.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: While Pacific Islanders make up just 4% of the state‚Äôs population, they represent 27% of the state‚Äôs newly confirmed coronavirus cases, according to state Department of Health data. White people have 20% of the newly confirmed cases and make up a quarter of the state‚Äôs population. The next highest rates are people of Filipino heritage, at 18%, and Native Hawaiians, with 14% of the state‚Äôs cases. No other ethnic group had double-digit figures, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said the ‚ÄúPacific Islander community has some unique challenges, particularly while living in very large, committed, multigenerational families ‚Äì a lot of them in Kalihi.‚Äù State Health Director Bruce Anderson said the disproportionate number of cases in the Pacific Islander community is rooted in socioeconomics, and state officials must help combat those inequities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state could finish the fiscal year with $405 million in surplus tax revenue in spite of the pandemic‚Äôs economic toll, according to a new revenue forecast. The state‚Äôs legislative budget office late Monday released its revised general fund revenue forecast for fiscal year 2021, which started July 1. Revenue comes in at $4.1 billion, according to the new forecast ‚Äì only $6.5 million below what lawmakers used in March when setting the budget and just before Republican Gov. Brad Little issued a stay-at-home order due to surging coronavirus infections. The surplus is being boosted by a nearly $100 million cut to state agencies and another nearly $100 million cut to public schools enacted earlier this year amid possible budget shortfall concerns due to the pandemic. The cuts came amid a steep economic downturn when thousands of Idaho workers lost their jobs.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: Social distancing is becoming a problem at local beaches as large crowds flock there during the pandemic, officials said. Visitation guidelines have been changed at some Lake County beaches to accommodate visitors, some of whom are from Chicago, where beaches remain closed. Bob Feffer, who has been a site manager at Illinois Beach State Park for 32 years, said he has not seen crowds like the ones during the weekends in July. The state park had about 15,000 visitors July 25-26, the Lake County News-Sun reports. ‚ÄúThere were just too many people for social distancing to take place,‚Äù Feffer said. The beach is no longer open on the weekends. David Motley, Waukegan‚Äôs director of marketing and public relations, said that ‚Äúthere was a lot of pent-up demand for people looking to get out and do something in the area. ... We already knew we could accommodate a large number.‚Äù\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: A school district that sent 228 students home to quarantine to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 has shuttered its middle and high schools for 14 days and switched to remote learning. Delaware Community Schools announced Tuesday night that it was closing Delta High School and Middle School for the period. ‚ÄúOur secondary schools seem to keep ramping up with exposure/symptom related issues that increase the number of quarantined students being excluded from school,‚Äù Superintendent Reece Mann said in a message to the school community. Parents of elementary students ‚Äúappear to be doing an incredible job of self-screening their children and keeping them home when they are exhibiting symptoms,‚Äù Mann said. Only seven students from the district‚Äôs three elementary schools had been sent home as of Tuesday morning, compared to 68 middle school and 153 high school students.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 600,000 masks, 109,085 face shields, 22,527 gallon-sized bottles of bleach, 63,074 bottles of hand sanitizer, 233,303 pairs of gloves and 12,398 thermometers. That‚Äôs what Iowa school districts have told the state they need to help protect students, teachers and staff from the coronavirus during the first 30 days of the school year ‚Äì even after they‚Äôve spent federal money and large sums from their own budgets to acquire supplies. They made the requests after Gov. Kim Reynolds pledged to provide up to a 30-day supply of personal protective equipment as part of Iowa‚Äôs Return to Learn plan. The Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management will begin distributing ‚Äúas many of the requested supplies as possible‚Äù beginning next week, Department of Education Director Ann Lebo said during a news conference with Reynolds last Thursday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Public health officials in three counties say a new state law is hurting their efforts to trace the contacts of people infected with COVID-19 by making it easier for them to refuse to cooperate. Public health departments often rely on employers to find out who has been in close contact with those infected, but the coronavirus law that was approved in June says ‚Äúthird parties,‚Äù such as employers and event hosts, must get consent from those who tested positive and close contacts to share their information to public health agencies. ‚ÄúOur disease investigators hold confidentiality to the utmost importance,‚Äù said Adrienne Byrne, director of the Sedgwick County Health Department in Wichita. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm not sure what all went behind that bill, but it has not been good for public health because being able to do contact tracing helps us identify people that might turn positive.‚Äù Officials in Wyandotte and Johnson counties have also raised concerns about the law.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky‚Äôs secretary of state has offered a preliminary election plan that calls for expanded early voting but excludes no-excuse absentee voting by mail for all voters amid the coronavirus. His proposal would allow Kentuckians to cast mail-in ballots if they decide their age or health condition makes it too risky to vote in-person, Secretary of State Michael Adams said. That option also would apply to people living with them or caring for them, he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think that we can do universal absentee (voting) because I think the system will crash,‚Äù Adams said. Adams‚Äô proposals on how to conduct the general election amid the global pandemic were submitted this week to Gov. Andy Beshear, who has said he supports no-excuse absentee voting for November. The state‚Äôs June primary, which included widespread absentee voting by mail, resulted in the highest turnout for a Bluegrass State primary since 2008 and won praise.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state‚Äôs education department has set up an email for parents, teachers and others to report violations of coronavirus safety standards for schools, Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley told the state‚Äôs top school board Tuesday. The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in mid-July adopted statewide rules for schools holding in-person instruction amid the virus outbreak, such as a mask mandate for school staff and students in grades three through 12; distancing standards; temperature checks to enter school premises; and school bus capacity limits. Brumley told the education board that anyone worried a school isn‚Äôt following the rules can email ldoecovid19support@la.gov. The person will receive a survey to fill out, and the information is sent to the school system‚Äôs leaders to respond. ‚ÄúWe have received a few concerns already,‚Äù Brumley said. Complaints reported to the department are posted online.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Dozens of cities, towns and tribal governments around the state will receive $4 million in grants to improve their response to the coronavirus pandemic, the administration of Gov. Janet Mills said Tuesday. The grants are designed to help fund projects that support public education campaigns, physical distancing projects and local businesses. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said the money has supported ‚Äúinnovative responses on the front lines of this pandemic.‚Äù One of the proposed projects is a campaign featuring a ‚ÄúMasked Moose‚Äù character in the town of Bethel. The campaign would include a costumed character who will visit schools and businesses to demonstrate the importance of coronavirus prevention. The round of grants is the second of its kind. The state announced nearly $9 million in grants to almost 100 municipalities in June.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A municipal government in China has donated 40,000 medical-grade face masks to Maryland‚Äôs capital city amid the coronavirus pandemic. The donations from Changsha, China, were first offered to Annapolis officials in April, when the need for the masks among public safety workers was high in the beginning days of the pandemic, Annapolis City Manager David Jarrell said in a news release Tuesday. They arrived this month, with one of the boxes featuring stickers of American and Chinese flags with a message that read: ‚ÄúGo, City of Annapolis! Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,‚Äù The Capital Gazette reports. Annapolis‚Äô relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Tuesday urged residents in nearly three dozen communities with concerning rates of COVID-19 infection to step up their efforts to slow the spread of the disease. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said 33 communities across the state are seeing more than four COVID-19 cases per 100,000. The four hardest-hit communities are Chelsea, Everett, Lynn and Revere, said Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders. Baker said his administration is reaching out to local leaders in moderate- and high-risk communities to offer state support in combating the virus. State officials are encouraging residents in those communities to be sure to wear masks, keep their distance from others and avoid large gatherings. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking everyone to recognize that this virus continue to infect, injure and kill people every single day,‚Äù Baker said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The pandemic has temporarily shut down the Red Children‚Äôs Art Museum in the city‚Äôs North End, so founder Yvette Rock is bringing art to Detroiters through a mobile art gallery. Most recently, Rock has been coaxing people out of their pandemic shells to enjoy children‚Äôs art through socially distanced exhibitions that are part of Live Coal Arts Mobile, a mobile gallery in an 18-foot trailer. Most recently, the gallery has featured art made of popsicle sticks and other recycled objects, as well as an exhibition where a young Detroiter can have their drawing built out of Lego blocks. Rock, 44 of Detroit, won‚Äôt let the pandemic or any other challenges distract her from her mission: to transform lives through art, education and community. Before there was the Live Coal Arts Mobile and RED, there was the Live Coal Gallery, created by Rock in 2012 in Detroit‚Äôs Woodbridge neighborhood with a goal of being inclusive.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMankato: The Legislature was called into session Wednesday, but lawmakers don‚Äôt expect much to happen. Some legislators expected this month‚Äôs special session to last a day or less. Gov. Tim Walz called the session to extend Minnesota‚Äôs peacetime emergency order by another 30 days. The Legislature likely won‚Äôt address any financial bills this week as the state plans to sell $1.2 billion in bonds this month. The bond sale requires the state to have a steady financial outlook for a set period of time, state officials say. ‚ÄúThe logic is, it would be like taking out a big car loan three days before you take out a mortgage,‚Äù said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato. ‚ÄúThe people you‚Äôre taking out your mortgage from wouldn‚Äôt look kindly on a big loan.‚Äù As a result, DFLers and Republicans likely won‚Äôt consider a supplemental budget bill, a tax bill or a public works bill until late September at the earliest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves described college football ‚Äì even amid the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äì as ‚Äúessential‚Äù Tuesday, his comments echoing a tweet President Donald Trump posted the day before. ‚ÄúWhat do opponents of football think, these kids will end up in a bubble without it? You can get COVID anywhere,‚Äù Reeves tweeted Tuesday afternoon. ‚ÄúThere are forces who want to cancel everything to avoid risk at all societal costs. It‚Äôs foolish. We have to balance risk & costs.‚Äù He said many players have been practicing for months over the summer and have built careers on football. Some have college scholarships riding on athletics. There is a way to let teams play while managing crowds, he said. ‚ÄúThere is risk in all of life. There are things we can do to manage it without destroying society,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLimit crowds and let ‚Äôem play!‚Äù Conferences are not canceling football because of safety, he asserted, but out of fear of lawsuits and ‚Äúbad press.‚Äù\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Drury University announced Tuesday that neck gaiters will no longer be considered acceptable face coverings on its campus. The university said in a tweet that it made the decision in consultation with the Springfield-Greene County Health Department. The announcement comes after a study released by Duke University analyzed more than a dozen different facial coverings ranging from hospital-grade N95 respirators to bandannas. Of the 14 masks and other coverings tested, the study found that popular alternatives such as neck gaiters, made of thin material, may be worse than not wearing a mask at all. The Washington Post brought the Duke study to attention through an article it posted Tuesday. The study used cameras and lasers to see the number of water droplets that come through each mask and found that a breathable neck gaiter ranked worse than the no-mask control group.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is allocating $50 million to increase the availability of child care in response to COVID-19, Gov. Steve Bullock said Tuesday. The funding was allocated from the state‚Äôs $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. The majority of the funding, $30 million, will be distributed in grants to providers who care for school-age children out of school time, officials said. An additional $10 million will be distributed to families with health needs and special needs requiring in-home care. Another $8 million will be divided among all licensed and registered child care facilities in the state to maintain and expand child care slots, cover increased staff costs, cover recruitment, address health and safety, and meet sanitation needs. The health department‚Äôs Child Care Resource and Referral Agency will receive $2 million for administration and outreach.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council on Tuesday approved an emergency mask mandate in indoor public places to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. The measure passed 7-0 after four hours of testimony from a divided public. The proposal had received support from many of the city‚Äôs biggest companies, including Union Pacific, TD Ameritrade, Mutual of Omaha and First National Bank. The proposed ordinance would require masks in places such as schools, businesses and churches. Eating and drinking in restaurants and bars, exercising in gyms, and visiting government offices would be excluded. Douglas County, which includes Omaha, has confirmed 11,449 coronavirus cases and 138 deaths since the pandemic began, according to the county‚Äôs tracking portal. The number of new daily cases has trended down over the past week. The number of cases in Lincoln has trended downward since the city began requiring masks July 20.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Dozens of teachers and parents gathered outside a high school Tuesday to argue against the Washoe County School District‚Äôs decision to reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The demonstration was held outside Spanish Springs High School in Sparks, north of Reno, where the district met in person a few days before students are expected to return Monday. The demonstration came after the district released a new reopening plan to help families prepare. But many teachers and parents have raised concerns about the safety of the plan and how to implement it. ‚ÄúToo many of the answers that we‚Äôre getting from the district are we don‚Äôt know yet, we don‚Äôt know yet, and that‚Äôs not acceptable,‚Äù said Robert Munson, a Washoe County teacher. The district meeting started at 4 p.m. and ended after 1 a.m. Wednesday. Most of the speakers were teachers who said they were frustrated with the decision.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu issued an executive order Tuesday requiring masks to be worn at scheduled gatherings of more than 100 people. Sununu, a Republican, has resisted calls to mandate the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and the new requirement falls far short of the mandates in the other five New England states, which generally require masks to be worn in public when social distancing isn‚Äôt possible. The order will be put to the test Aug. 22-30 at the annual Laconia Motorcycle Week, which typically attracts thousands of people to the state. It‚Äôs a smaller version of the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a 10-day event that began Friday in South Dakota. The mandate won‚Äôt apply to large workplaces or to schools, unless students gather for an assembly or other large event, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that schools that cannot meet health and safety guidelines for an in-person start to the academic year can go with an all-remote option. The first-term Democratic governor said he will also soon sign an executive order that paves the way for the state‚Äôs roughly 600 schools to begin in-person instruction in September. The ability for some schools to start entirely remotely is a change from the governor‚Äôs June guidance, which required all schools to have in-person instruction. Then, in July, Murphy approved an option for parents to request all-remote learning for their children. Murphy said the change stemmed from ‚Äúour willingness to listen‚Äù to stakeholders. The disruption stems from the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to three months of remote learning in the previous academic year. The health and safety guidelines include maintaining social distance and mask-wearing for staff and students.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The school year is getting underway at some of the state‚Äôs largest public school districts as teachers, students and parents deal with remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic. Albuquerque Public Schools started Wednesday. Schools in the district have been distributing technology to students, making virtual home visits, and providing guidance to staff, students and families. The Las Cruces district has outlined protocols for instruction, technology and nutrition services for that district‚Äôs all-online start. ‚ÄúWe have prepared, and we are ready,‚Äù Las Cruces Superintendent Karen Trujillo said in a statement. She said educators participated in more than 350 professional development webinars to prepare for the start of virtual classes, and laptops and tablets were ordered at the beginning of the summer with the aim of every student having access to a device. Some students are still waiting, though, due to shipping delays.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Evictions are still on hold in the state‚Äôs courts as housing advocates worry about the fate of an estimated 14,000 renters who faced eviction before the declaration of a COVID-19 emergency. Courts spokeswoman Lucian Chalfen said Friday that the state‚Äôs stay of evictions is still in effect through a March 16 order signed by the state‚Äôs chief administrative judge. The announcement comes as housing advocates including the Legal Aid Society hope New York courts will heed Gov. Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs call for ‚Äúno evictions‚Äù amid the pandemic. Last week Cuomo said a new state law makes clear that no evictions are allowed while New York is in a pandemic. ‚ÄúI signed the law, and the law is clear,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúUntil when? Until I say COVID is over. And you know, we‚Äôll figure out when that is.‚Äù Still, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society said the law alone doesn‚Äôt offer enough certainty to tenants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper won another legal victory defending his COVID-19 executive orders Tuesday, this time when a judge rejected Lt. Gov. Dan Forest‚Äôs demand that they be blocked by declaring his lawsuit is unlikely to succeed. The Republican lieutenant governor sued Cooper last month, alleging the Democrat‚Äôs orders limiting business activities and mass gatherings and mandating face coverings were unlawful because he failed to first get support from the Council of State. The 10-member council includes both of them, Attorney General Josh Stein and other statewide elected officials. Cooper‚Äôs state attorneys argued in a virtual hearing last week that the governor acted properly under portions of the Emergency Management Act that don‚Äôt require the concurrence of the council. They said the law lets him act unilaterally when he determines local governments are unable to respond effectively in the emergency.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said Wednesday that a new partnership with Minot State University will help ease the state‚Äôs shortage of special education teachers. Minot State will receive a $750,000 grant to pay for scholarships for 20 paraprofessionals who work with special education students, Baesler said. The grant money will help the paraprofessionals earn bachelor of science degrees with a major in special education. The $750,000 comes from federal coronavirus relief aid approved by Congress in March, which included emergency assistance to schools. Minot State special education department chairwoman Holly Pedersen said the university is excited to have an opportunity to partner with the state and find solutions to address the special education teacher shortage that‚Äôs happening nationwide.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Nearly 600,000 Ohio schoolchildren in 325 districts will return to school this fall for in-person classes, according to figures released by Gov. Mike DeWine. Almost 400,000 students in 55 districts will be attending online, while about 380,000 students in 154 districts will be doing some combination of in-person and online classes, the governor said. The state didn‚Äôt have information for 78 additional districts. DeWine said he believes schools are doing a good job of getting ready for all options. But children‚Äôs well-being as they return to classes, as well as their ability to do activities ranging from sports to band to theater, will be influenced by community efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the governor emphasized in Tuesday remarks. That includes continued mask-wearing, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Tulsa State Fair has been canceled this year amid concerns about the coronavirus, joining the previous cancellation of the Oklahoma State Fair in Oklahoma City. The Tulsa County Public Facilities Authority voted 5-0 to cancel the fair scheduled for Oct. 1-11 but said the Junior Livestock Show will continue. ‚ÄúI know for us it is a huge hit in the loss of money, but for me the greater concern has to be the health of our community and those who come here and then go home,‚Äù Tulsa County Commissioner and TCPFA Chair Karen Keith said during Tuesday‚Äôs meeting. Oklahoma State Fair officials announced in June the cancellation the Oklahoma City event scheduled for late September. The Oklahoma State Health Department on Wednesday reported 45,398 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 627 deaths due to COVID-19, an increase of 670 cases and nine more deaths than reported Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state‚Äôs tallest waterfall, one of its most popular attractions, has reopened to the public with new guidelines in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Multnomah Falls opened in the Columbia River Gorge on Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service announced. New social distancing and face mask mandates were also announced, in addition to other strategies to keep crowds down and visitors separated from one another, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. There will be two phases to the reopening, the forest service said. The first, effective now, is first-come, first served and allows up to 300 visitors at a time between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to check in and wait in a socially distanced queue to the viewing platform at the bottom of the waterfall. The second phase, expected to be implemented in the next few weeks, will involve an online ticketing system allowing 300 people to visit the waterfall each hour.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Mayors are challenging the state‚Äôs members of Congress to help them get direct budget aid from the federal government, warning that cities of all sizes face steep deficits and deep service cuts as a result of the coronavirus‚Äô impact on the economy. With Washington in a stalemate over a new round of funding, mayors warned of severe consequences on services and the economy without an injection of federal aid to cover slackening tax collections. They also pointed out that they received little in trickle-down from a prior round of aid to cover coronavirus costs that went to states and the most heavily populated counties. Pennsylvania‚Äôs 20-member congressional delegation is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with nearly every Republican balking at another round of federal aid.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will delay the reopening of public schools by two weeks, to Sept. 14, to give educators more time to prepare to welcome returning students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Gina Raimondo announced her decision to give schools extra time Wednesday, saying that while she is eager for schools to resume in-person classes, it must be done responsibly. ‚ÄúIt gives schools a little more time to be ready,‚Äù said Raimondo, a Democrat. ‚ÄúSo you can have confidence that when we reopen school we‚Äôll be in good shape. We owe it to the children.‚Äù Under Raimondo‚Äôs plan, local schools will be allowed to resume full-time in-person instruction only if they meet certain safety benchmarks. A final decision is expected the week of Aug. 31. Raimondo said local districts must put in place detailed plans dealing with details such as student transportation, in-school traffic flow, class size and mask use.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Most school districts in the state will not open their doors to students all five days a week when they start the new academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the governor demanded all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option. The state Education Department approved the last of the reopening plans for all 81 districts in the state Monday. Just 1 out of every 5 school districts will open its doors to students five days a week, and four plans start without any in-person option for classes, although those districts promised to bring in students whose parents want them to be in a school building as soon as it is safe. On July 15, Gov. Henry McMaster said he wanted to see all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option, saying that ‚Äúwe must have our schools available‚Äù and that ‚Äúparents must have a choice.‚Äù Many school boards resisted.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A local company that is developing a COVID-19 therapeutic announced Tuesday that it has embarked on human trials. SAB Biotherapeutics said 28 healthy volunteers were participating in the company‚Äôs phase-one trial of its antibody treatment known as SAB-185. The phase-one study will evaluate the safety of treating patients with the therapeutic, which is a human antibody that can be produced at large scale using genetically modified cattle. The 28 healthy volunteers will be given single and multiple ascending doses of SAB-185 to demonstrate its safety. A second part of the phase-one study to evaluate the safety and pharmacological activity in SAB-185 in COVID-19 patients is slated to begin later this month. Besides treating ill patients, SAB-185 is being developed for use by first responders and others as a protective treatment.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Legislation designed to provide sweeping liability protections against coronavirus lawsuits to schools, health care providers and businesses advanced Tuesday. The Republican-dominated Statehouse is convening for a special legislative session to address not only COVID-19 liability but also telemedicine coverage and penalties against protesters. Gov. Bill Lee announced last week that he was convening a special legislative session to address a handful of bills lawmakers failed to advance earlier this year before adjourning in mid-June. Back then, the main dividing line over the liability bill was whether to make its protections retroactive to early March, which the Senate supported and the House opposed. The telemedicine bill was spiked as a response to the failure to pass the liability bill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state surpassed 500,000 confirmed coronavirus cases Tuesday as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott suggested family and neighborhood gatherings are behind a sharp rise in the rate of positive tests, which has climbed to record levels just as schools are beginning to reopen across the state. He also continued to say more testing in Texas is likely after dropping off in recent weeks, a trend seen across the U.S. even as deaths mount. Texas has reported more than 1,400 new deaths over the past week, including 220 on Tuesday. Although health officials say there are encouraging signs in Texas ‚Äì particularly hospitalization levels that have dropped more than 30% since July‚Äôs peak ‚Äì infection rates have been on a steady increase. On Tuesday, the rolling average of positive cases over the past seven days jumped to 24%, by far the highest of the pandemic, according to figures from the state Department of Health Services.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: For the first time in more than 43 years, the St. George Marathon is off. The city announced in a statement Tuesday that this year‚Äôs marathon, scheduled to take place Oct.3, will be canceled ‚Äúdue to concerns related to the potential spread of COVID-19 and the challenge of providing adequate health and safety protections for race participants and volunteers.‚Äù One of the largest marathons in the country, the annual St. George Marathon traditionally sees about 7,000 runners take part. Meanwhile, organizers have officially canceled the 2020 St. George IRONMAN Triathlon, also citing concerns about the pandemic. One of St. George‚Äôs biggest draws, the annual event typically draws athletes from around the world, bringing an average of $7 million in economic impact to Southern Utah. Initially scheduled for May 2, the event had earlier been postponed until September.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: With the start of school less than a month away, state officials on Tuesday announced some revisions to the school restart guidance, and Republican Gov. Phil Scott reiterated how important he thinks reopening schools is. Scott said he worries about the children of parents who don‚Äôt have time to teach their kids and struggle to pay for child care and the negative effect not reopening schools would have on them and children of more vulnerable families. ‚ÄúI truly believe that if we don‚Äôt provide a way to get those kids back into school, we‚Äôll see the ramifications for years to come,‚Äù said Scott, who acknowledged the anxiety of some parents and teachers. The state will likely see some cases and clusters connected to schools, even though it has the lowest number of coronavirus cases in the country, he said. But the state has worked hard to build up its testing and tracing capacity, Scott and State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Renovations have been delayed at the municipal building where a mass shooting happened last year. The Virginian-Pilot reports city officials don‚Äôt have enough money to pay for it now because of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter last week, the mayor of Virginia Beach asked the Legislature to consider allocating $10 million toward the renovations. Employees who worked in the building where 12 people were killed have been working at home and in offices across the city. The city plans to turn Building 2 into the headquarters for the police department. Plans also call for renovating several other buildings to bring former Building 2 employees back to the municipal center so that the Departments of Public Works, Public Utilities and Planning can again offer citizens services in one place.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State residents applied for relief funds as the coronavirus pandemic diminished their incomes and savings. But for undocumented workers, that wasn‚Äôt an option. After months of pressure from immigration activists and organizations, Gov. Jay Inslee is launching a $40 million state fund for undocumented workers, the Northwest News Network reports. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to have a good chunk of money allocated to our community,‚Äù said Alejandra Perez, an immigration activist from the Seattle area who‚Äôs been working with the governor‚Äôs staff, Initially, the fund was a grassroots effort among several organizations to raise $100,000, but it raised $5 million over the past several months. Washington has an estimated 240,000 residents without legal authorization, according to the Pew Research Center, and they pay an estimated $368 million in state and local taxes.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The number of reported deaths from the new coronavirus in the state has jumped 23% in the past week, with six more fatalities announced Wednesday, pushing the total to at least 153. The state of 1.8 million residents has seen a smaller amount of cases and deaths compared to other places since the pandemic began. Lately, though, the numbers have been alarming. Confirmed cases have tripled in the past seven weeks, surpassing the 8,000 mark total Wednesday, while the numbers of deaths have shot up 66%. Officials have blamed the recent surge in part on vacation trips to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a popular destination for West Virginians. Gov. Jim Justice has constantly urged residents to wear masks but has resisted reimposing additional restrictions.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank delivered a sobering message Wednesday about the state‚Äôs flagship campus as the fall semester looms, saying that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a real financial crisis‚Äù due to the coronavirus pandemic. How bad the crisis will be depends on several factors, Blank said in an online presentation at the Rotary Club of Madison. Those include whether students who are enrolled for the fall semester actually show up, how deep state budget cuts are and whether the Legislature gives the university the authority to borrow money. Blank projected the loss to UW-Madison to be about $150 million with a full student body this fall. The loss will be greater if fewer students return who have committed and if state budget cuts worsen, she said. For now, the university is on track to have its target of about 7,400 freshmen on campus, she said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming is no longer the only state without its own suicide prevention call center. The Central Wyoming Counseling Center launched the state‚Äôs first and only service Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming has one of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. Residents previously were able to call national hotlines, but those answering don‚Äôt have important knowledge about the state, counseling center CEO Kevin Hazucha said. Hazucha and Bernice Hazucha came to Wyoming from New York in 2018 and spent a year meeting with various officials on starting a suicide call line. Wyoming eventually issued a request for proposals, and the Central Wyoming Counseling Center responded. Wyoming has allocated $400,000 for the hotline for two years. The suicide hotline will be staffed 40 hours a week, but organizers hope to expand that to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/05/fest-cancellations-mixed-results-unemployment-slowdown-news-around-states/111909850/", "title": "Fest cancellations, mixed-up results: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state prison system said Wednesday that a second inmate has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as the number of cases among inmates and staff continued to rise. William Hershell Moon, a 74-year-old inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility, died Wednesday at a hospital. ‚ÄúThe Alabama Department of Corrections extends its sympathies to the Moon family and his loved ones during this difficult time,‚Äù the prison system said in a statement. The prison system said four other inmates housed in the same small living area as Moon also tested positive for COVID-19. That living area within St. Clair‚Äôs infirmary is on level-two quarantine, and the entire infirmary at St. Clair remains on level-one quarantine, the prison system said. A total of 19 inmates have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the prison system. Ten of those are currently ill.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Three members of the Nikiski Fire Department have tested positive for COVID-19, and eight others were in quarantine pending test results, a spokesperson for the Kenai Peninsula Borough said Wednesday. Brenda Ahlberg said the 11 individuals were part of one shift. The borough‚Äôs emergency management office, in a release, said testing has been conducted for all department personnel. Ahlberg said that includes full-time staff and volunteers. Nikiski Fire Chief Bryan Crisp said the department will continue to follow federal health protocols and recommendations from the borough‚Äôs physician director, which include wearing protective gear and cleaning equipment. Personnel from other departments have agreed to help the Nikiski department, the release said. The local public health department is investigating the cases as part of efforts to determine whether others may need to be tested, KSRM radio reports.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: State officials reported nearly 1,000 new coronavirus cases Wednesday amid a recent surge in hospitalizations, a little over two weeks after Gov. Doug Ducey ended his stay-at-home order. The surge of new cases of COVID-19 is a troubling sign for former state health director Will Humble, who said the timing is too close to be coincidence. ‚ÄúThe one thing it does is it shows us that the stay-at-home order worked,‚Äù Humble said. ‚ÄúBecause when it ended you see an increase in cases on the 26th, which is 10 days after it ended. You can look at it county by county by county and see the same thing.‚Äù The current director of the state Department of Health Services, Dr. Cara Christ, said there are other factors that could account for some of the increase, including greater testing. But she acknowledged the stay-home order‚Äôs end likely played a role.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state‚Äôs number of cases continued to rise Wednesday of the illness caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and officials say six more people have died. The Health Department said at least 8,067 people in the state have tested positive for the virus, an increase over the 7,818 reported Tuesday. The number of active cases, excluding those who have died or recovered, reached a new high of 2,208. The true number is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The number of people who have died in Arkansas from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, rose from 136 Tuesday to 142. Arkansas‚Äô active cases have increased since late May as businesses that had closed because of the pandemic have been allowed to reopen. The state has also increased testing in recent weeks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Democratic legislative leaders have agreed on a budget they say covers the state‚Äôs estimated $54.3 billion deficit while avoiding most of Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs proposed budget cuts to public education and health care services. The budget appears to hew many of Newsom‚Äôs expectations, including relying on the expectation that California will get significant federal funding to address the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. It also includes Newsom‚Äôs proposed tax increase on some businesses, which is forecast to generate $4.4 billion annually, although it rejects $8 billion in cuts to public education Newsom included in his plan. If the federal money does not materialize, school districts would have to defer about $9 billion in costs to future years by borrowing or using reserves.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The Aurora Police Department announced Wednesday that officers are searching for three people suspected of violently attacking a woman in Target after the shopper asked the group to grant her more social distance. A man and two women bumped into the shopper inside the Target in Aurora on May 8 before the shopper then asked the group to give her more space, The Aurora Sentinel reports. The group began accosting the shopper and threw a box of tissues at her head before continuing to beat her, investigators said. The shopper suffered multiple broken bones. All three suspects, believed to be in their late teens to late 20s, were captured on surveillance footage leaving the store in a dark red SUV, authorities said. Police have encouraged anyone with any information to contact local authorities. Social distancing guidelines have been implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Some struggling immigrant families in the state without legal status will receive a share of $3.5 million in public and private money for COVID-19 relief. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that $2.5 million in state-funded grants to landlords will be provided on behalf of renters who are ineligible for similar aid under the federal CARES Act. Additionally, the nonprofit philanthropic organization 4-CT plans to make $1 million ‚Äì in the form of one-time debit cards in denominations of $200 or $400 ‚Äì available to Connecticut families excluded from federal relief programs. Grassroots immigrant rights groups will help identify families for the financial assistance and send them to local clinics, where medical staff will first offer COVID-19 testing before providing the debit cards. The state has prioritized the testing of densely populated urban centers to keep track of future outbreaks of the coronavirus.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The number of initial unemployment claims filed by Delawareans fell again last week to its lowest level since before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The Delaware Department of Labor reported Thursday that 3,052 initial unemployment claims were filed for the week ending May 30. That‚Äôs six times less than the number of claims filed in both the last week of March and the first week of April. Officials said more than 103,500 initial jobless claims have been filed since March 15 and more than $327 million in unemployment benefits paid. That total includes $209 million in federal funds and $117.5 million from Delaware‚Äôs unemployment insurance trust fund. By comparison, the fund paid out a total of $59 million in 2019. Jobless claims soared after Democratic Gov. John Carney imposed wide-ranging restrictions and closures on businesses in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown aims to give pedestrians more room for social distancing by removing some street parking to make sidewalks wider, WTOP-FM reports. Several times in the past, the neighborhood has temporarily widened M Street and Wisconsin Avenue sidewalks for weekend events by using portable crowd control barriers. But that won‚Äôt work for longer-term plans.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The city‚Äôs First Presbyterian Church has made a donation of more than $500,000 to Central Florida‚Äôs nonprofits to help ease some of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus. The church pooled money from from virtual collection plates and used leftover funds from a capital campaign, bequests and an annual missions drive, Senior Pastor David Swanson said. ‚ÄúWe have what we call our Good Samaritan Fund to help people pay the light bill, pay the rent, make a car payment, pay the mortgage,‚Äù Swanson told the Orlando Sentinel. ‚ÄúNormally we get three, maybe four requests a month. But since COVID started, we‚Äôve had 170. People are desperate.‚Äù In addition, church officials decided to support the region‚Äôs nonprofit agencies that feed, shelter and serve the tens of thousands of Central Florida workers who have been furloughed or laid off. Checks ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 will go to 14 charitable agencies in the area.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Legislature will resume session June 15 under an agreement announced by House and Senate leaders Wednesday. The 40-day legislative session was put on hold in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker David Ralston and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced the start date in a letter to members. Ralston and Duncan had to agree on when to restart under the terms of the resolution that halted the session March 13. The two previously had differing opinions on when to restart. When lawmakers reconvene, one of their biggest tasks will be grappling with a state budget that has been turned upside down by the pandemic. There have also been calls for Georgia to enact a hate crime law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Members of the U.S. military arriving in Hawaii will not be subjected to the state‚Äôs quarantine rule resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, but service members will follow a separate order restricting their movements. The Department of Homeland Security exempted military members from the state‚Äôs quarantine guidelines for arriving travelers, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. But the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees operations in the state, said its own ‚Äúrestriction of movement‚Äù guidelines prohibit service members from going out for 14 days except for travel to places considered essential, such as grocery stores, doctors or pharmacies. The military order is less restrictive than the requirements for arriving civilian residents and tourists, who are required to stay in a dwelling for 14 days without traveling into the community.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials on Thursday announced that a northern Idaho county with a drug-trafficking problem will be included in a regional enforcement network and will face a crackdown. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration designated Kootenai County as part of the Idaho/Oregon High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. The designation means that law enforcement agencies will get federal grant money and that federal, state, local and tribal police will be better able to coordinate activities and share information. ‚ÄúWe will focus on drug traffickers, not users,‚Äù said Idaho State Police Capt. John Kempf. ‚ÄúDealers ‚Äì people who make money off the misery of people who are addicted to drugs.‚Äù\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three members of the Legislature want lawmakers to return to Springfield for an emergency legislative session to address criminal justice reform and rebuilding communities in the wake of ‚Äúprotests and subsequent civil unrest‚Äù in recent days. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that in a letter to House Speaker Mike Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon, Reps. Kam Buckner, Curtis Tarver and Lamont Robinson, all Democrats, say communities can‚Äôt wait until the fall veto session to address the unrest resulting from the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. ‚ÄúWe are in a state of emergency and need to act immediately,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote. The COVID-19 pandemic has kept the General Assembly from Springfield, with lawmakers meeting in May for a four-day session to pass a budget and other legislation. At the time legislators adjourned May 24, Harmon said he didn‚Äôt think anyone was eager to return for a special session.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state had about 24,000 people apply for unemployment benefits last week, following the national trend of slowing job losses after coronavirus-related business closures started in mid-March. Some 240,000 Indiana residents received jobless aid for the week ending May 23, according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics released Thursday. That is down from the peak of nearly 295,000 in early May just before statewide business and travel restrictions started being eased but still more than 10 times the level of early March. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday signed a 30-day extension of the state‚Äôs public health emergency until July 4, when he expects to lift most limits on businesses, large gatherings and entertainment activities. Indiana had the country‚Äôs fifth-highest unemployment rate for April at 16.9%, topping the national rate of 14.7%.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republican state lawmakers proposed a bill Wednesday that would offer broad protection from coronavirus lawsuits for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, meatpacking plants, restaurants and other businesses. The measure, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2020, was tacked onto a medical malpractice bill that previously had passed the Senate. After swift passage in a House subcommittee and committee Wednesday, it‚Äôs eligible for House floor debate. If approved in the House, the Senate only needs to agree with the new language, and it would go to the governor for her consideration. Democratic Rep. Brian Meyer, a lawyer, unsuccessfully attempted to amend the measure to require business owners to prove they followed government guidelines and federal and state laws to get protection from lawsuits.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A bill giving lawmakers some oversight of the state‚Äôs coronavirus response cleared the House on Wednesday night and is headed to the Senate. The Legislature convened for a special session called by Gov. Laura Kelly after she vetoed a sweeping coronavirus bill GOP lawmakers approved in May moments before adjourning their annual session. That measure would have curbed Kelly‚Äôs power to direct the state‚Äôs pandemic response; given legislative leaders the final say over how $1.25 billion in federal relief funds are spent; and protected businesses, medical providers and nursing homes from lawsuits. Kelly‚Äôs staff and top Republicans have been negotiating since then. GOP lawmakers unveiled a new plan Tuesday that also would give legislators oversight of spending, prevent coronavirus-related lawsuits, and limit Kelly‚Äôs ability to close businesses statewide this fall and winter. The vote in the House was 107-12.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A 9-month-old who tested positive for COVID-19 was among eight more people whose deaths were related to the coronavirus in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Wednesday. The latest deaths raised the statewide death toll to 450 since the pandemic began. In announcing the infant‚Äôs death, Beshear said: ‚ÄúFar too often, people think that it‚Äôs something that only happens to medically compromised seniors. This is a reminder of how deadly this virus can be. How precious all of our lives are.‚Äù Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky‚Äôs public health commissioner, said it‚Äôs not conclusive that the infant from Hopkins County died as a direct result of COVID-19. The state‚Äôs reporting methodology is to list her death as a coronavirus-related death since she tested positive for the virus. ‚ÄúIt is possible that COVID did directly contribute to the death,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also possible that it did not. It may be one of those things we never come to find out for sure.‚Äù\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: About two-thirds of those who are eligible have signed up for a program aimed at making sure children from low-income families can get healthy meals while schools are closed for the coronavirus pandemic, the state education department said Wednesday. The deadline for signing up for the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program is Monday. The federal program is aimed at families of children in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade who normally receive free or reduced-price meals at school. Families can apply through a P-EBT portal on the Louisiana Department of Education website. The department said applications have been submitted on behalf of 403,731 children ‚Äì about 66% of those eligible. Louisiana schools have been closed since March 16 as the state fought the spread of the virus.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Higher education leaders released a framework for reopening the state‚Äôs colleges and universities Thursday that prioritizes on-campus learning in the fall. The guidelines are the product of a working group that includes University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy. The guidelines state that Maine will give ‚Äúthe strongest consideration to make in-person, on-campus experiences available in Maine institutions as widely as possible for the fall 2020 term‚Äù and beyond. It also states that higher education leaders in Maine will let science and data inform the reopening. The reopening framework states that colleges and universities in Maine will stay in consultation as institutions begin to open. It‚Äôs intended to serve as a guide for decision making by the institutions.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will begin its second stage of reopening later this week by lifting the order that closed nonessential businesses in response to the coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The order will be lifted Friday at 5 p.m., enabling large and small retail shops to open, as well as wholesalers and warehouses. Offices including information technology firms, legal offices, and banking and financial institutions can open as well. Hogan said personal services such as nail salons and tanning salons can reopen with 50% capacity and by appointment only. Face coverings will be encouraged whenever face-to-face interactions take place, Hogan said. Businesses are also being encouraged to implement a screening process, including temperature checks for personnel. The governor emphasized that just because people will be allowed to return to work doesn‚Äôt mean they necessarily should.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The next phase in getting the state back in business, including reopening child care centers, could start as soon as Monday if downward trends in the coronavirus pandemic continue, Gov. Charlie Baker said. The official announcement on Phase 2 of the reopening plan will come Saturday, Baker said at a news conference Wednesday. Child care centers, which currently are open only to children of emergency workers, will need to screen staffers and youngsters for symptoms of illness before allowing them in each day. Centers must use only one entrance, stagger drop-off schedules and try to avert close contact between children. At summer camps, attendees will have to stay in their groups, counselors won‚Äôt be able to move among groups, and field trips will be banned for now. Retails stores that open their floors in Phase 2 must limit occupancy, require face masks and ‚Äì for groceries and pharmacies ‚Äì create special hours for customers older than 60.\n\nMichigan\n\nLenox Township: More than 100 prisoners in southeastern Michigan were given the wrong results of coronavirus tests, the Corrections Department said. Fifty-four men were told they tested positive while another 54 were told they tested negative at Macomb Correctional Center. The results were actually the reverse, spokesman Chris Gautz said. The mistake led to prisoners subsequently being housed in wrong areas, Gautz said. The Corrections Department recently finished testing the statewide population of 38,000 prisoners. About 10% were infected, and 68 prisoners have died, including five at Macomb. ‚ÄúWe were a facility that had one of the largest outbreaks in the state, and you‚Äôre still making mistakes like this?‚Äù prisoner Jamie Meade said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Another 29 Minnesotans have died from COVID-19, and 404 more people have tested positive for the disease, according to Thursday‚Äôs report from the Minnesota Department of Health. The Benedict Homes assisted living facility in Sherburne Countty was added to the list of congregate care facilities with outbreaks of the virus Thursday. Statewide, the number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus reached 26,273 on Thursday, and 1,115 people have died, according to MDH. Of those cases, 3,253 have required hospitalization, and 512 remained hospitalized Thursday. Of those hospitalized, 244 are in intensive care. Across the state, 21,490 coronavirus patients no longer need isolation.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The 2020 edition of ‚ÄúMississippi‚Äôs Giant Houseparty‚Äù is being canceled because of concern about the coronavirus pandemic. Directors of the Neshoba County Fair said in a statement Wednesday that they‚Äôve been consulting with public health officials and determined it would not be possible to ensure that people ‚Äúsafely and effectively‚Äù follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. The fair typically attracts tens of thousands of people to the red clay hills of east central Mississippi. Extended groups of families and friends live in cabins on the campgrounds for more than a week, and crowds are even larger on the two days that politicians speak under the main pavilion on the fairgrounds. The fair also has a midway, musical performances and horseracing. The fair dates back to the 1890s and has previously been canceled only during World War II.\n\nMissouri\n\nOsage Beach: No additional cases of the new coronavirus have been reported stemming from the crowded pool parties at Missouri‚Äôs Lake of the Ozarks over Memorial Day weekend, the state‚Äôs top health official said. Camden County Health Department reported Friday that a person from Boone County who had attended the parties tested positive for the virus. Speaking at a news conference in Jefferson City on Wednesday, Dr. Randall Williams, the director of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said no more cases have been uncovered since, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Social media postings of the event showed large crowds of mostly young people without masks and not adhering to social distancing guidelines at pools along the central Missouri lake that is a popular weekend getaway spot. The pictures and video of crowds at the lake prompted a public outcry and led health officials to urge anyone who attended the parties to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Applications for unemployment payments in Montana declined last week as the state continues to lift closures put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The number of new applications for job assistance submitted in Montana last week fell to 2,874, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. That‚Äôs a decrease of nearly 25% from the 3,821 claims filed a week earlier but an increase of nearly 280% from the number of applications submitted at the same time last year. Montana has processed 108,572 claims for unemployment since March 14. That represents 23.8% of the total workforce eligible for the unemployment insurance program. As of May 23, 47,350 Montana residents were receiving unemployment benefits, which is 10.4% of all eligible employees.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Six more people have died from the coronavirus in the state, and officials have confirmed 255 new cases, according to the state‚Äôs online tracking portal. The number of known cases rose to 14,866, and the number of deaths has reached 187 as of Wednesday night. More than 112,400 people have been tested. Hospital capacity is relatively stable, with 42% of hospital beds, 46% of intensive care unit beds and 75% of ventilators available for use. Gov. Pete Ricketts had been scheduled to answer media questions about the coronavirus Thursday but canceled that plan, saying he was doing so out of respect for the nationally televised memorial service of George Floyd, the black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody has triggered national protests.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state has seen more than a month of declining rates of coronavirus-related hospitalizations and positive tests for COVID-19, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday. The governor said in a statement that Nevada has made significant progress meeting five benchmarks he set in late April in order to start easing restrictions on gatherings and business closures. The Democrat said Nevadans who took the threat of the virus seriously helped the state ‚Äúto slowly begin to reopen its communities and the economy on the path to a new normal.‚Äù Nevada has seen the rate of positive COVID-19 cases drop for at least 39 days, with 5.7% of all people having the disease out of everyone tested. The rate of hospitalizations has declined for 43 days, the state has the ability to test patients who don‚Äôt show symptoms of the virus, and Nevada has set up a contact tracing system. The state also has the ability to intervene in any outbreaks, and all nursing homes have been inspected.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The temporary expansion of telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic would become permanent under a bill considered Thursday by a Senate committee. As passed by the House in March, the bill would allow reimbursement for medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders conducted via telehealth. But an amendment before the Senate Health and Human Services Committee would also make permanent the provisions of Gov. Chris Sununu‚Äôs emergency order on telehealth, which allowed all health care providers to offer services via phone, video and other remote systems and required insurers to cover them. Officials representing hospitals, community health centers, dentists and mental health providers all told the committee that telehealth has been a valuable tool during the pandemic and should continue.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday unveiled and endorsed recommendations on improving nursing homes‚Äô responses to outbreaks after COVID-19 ravaged long-term care facilities in the state. The 100-page report calls for improving nursing homes‚Äô emergency response by consolidating operations for all facilities in a single center. The plan also calls for increasing wages and ensuring access to paid sick leave. The report was compiled by consultants at the firm Manatt, which Murphy‚Äôs administration hired for $500,000, according to records obtained under the open records act. New Jersey‚Äôs long-term care facilities have been had hit by the outbreak, accounting for nearly half of the state‚Äôs fatalities from the virus. Murphy reported Wednesday that there were 5,076 lab-confirmed deaths among residents and staff at long-term care facilities.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State health officials say they have confirmed 25 more coronavirus cases among federal inmates being held at a lockup in southern New Mexico. The state Health Department on Wednesday said the cases from the prison in Otero County brought the statewide total to 8,140. More than 160 state inmates being held at the same facility also have tested positive. The state also reported eight additional deaths ‚Äì all from McKinley and San Juan counties. Those areas have been hit the hardest and account for more than half of New Mexico‚Äôs infections. More than 40 long-term care and acute care facilities around the state also have reported at least one case among residents and staff over the past month.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The state began to allow outdoor dining at restaurants as soon as Thursday in much of the state outside of New York City and its suburbs as coronavirus restrictions ease, after Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the move Wednesday. Restaurants must place outdoor tables 6 feet apart, all staff must wear face coverings, and customers must also wear a covering when not seated, under the rules Cuomo announced in a news release. The order applies to regions that have entered the second phase of Cuomo‚Äôs four-step reopening plan, including the Capital region, western New York, central New York and the Finger Lakes. The areas that will have to wait for outdoor dining include Long Island and the mid-Hudson Valley, which entered the first phase of reopening last week, and New York City, which is scheduled to enter the first phase next week.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wants to let more young people begin driving on their own even though the North Carolina DMV isn‚Äôt currently offering required behind-the-wheel tests due to COVID-19 health worries. The full House and a Senate committee approved separate measures Wednesday that would set aside the behind-the-wheel test for teenagers seeking a limited provisional license and help ease a bottleneck of applicants. A young person still must log 60 hours of driving with a parent to seek such a permit. The House bill would waive the road-test mandate for these youths until the Division of Motor Vehicles administered them again or for six months, whichever date is later. A legislative lobbyist for the Department of Transportation, which oversees the DMV, told House Rules Committee members that the agency supported the waiver.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials said Thursday that 27 additional people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the state, bringing its total to 2,706 cases. North Dakota has confirmed 66 deaths from complications of the coronavirus, but none were reported Thursday. Officials said 1,242 people have been screened since Wednesday, bringing the total tested in North Dakota to 104,888. Twenty of the positive cases reported Thursday were in Cass County, which has been the epicenter of the state‚Äôs coronavirus outbreak. They county that contains Fargo now has a total of 1,803 confirmed cases. Thirty-two people were hospitalized Thursday, down two from the day before.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A proposal by House Republicans to require individuals‚Äô written consent for the state to track the spread of the coronavirus was rejected by fellow Republicans in the Ohio Senate on Wednesday. The House would have required in-writing permission before the Health Department could undertake what is known as contact tracing. This technique allows investigators to reach out to people who have been in close and recent proximity to someone who tests positive for COVID-19. The proposal reflected the disagreement many conservative House Republicans have with GOP Gov. Mike DeWine‚Äôs response to the coronavirus, which they feel has gone too far. But Senate Republicans joined by Democrats said the proposal itself went too far and could rule out people willing to allow the tracing but unable to sign a form if, for example, they were out of town. Contact tracing is considered essential to tracking a contagious illness as a means of slowing it down.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reversed course on its decision from earlier this week to no longer release COVID-19 infection data by city and zip code. The agency made the move after consulting with Attorney General Mike Hunter, who advised them releasing epidemiological information for statistical purposes is legal as long as no individual person can be identified. Hunter said in a statement that the release of the more detailed infection data by locality ‚Äúthreads the needle of providing up-to-date information to the public while protecting the privacy of Oklahomans.‚Äù Lawyers for the health department and the governor‚Äôs office had made a decision earlier this week to no longer release the data because of state medical privacy laws. They claimed they had previously been able to release the data under the expired Catastrophic Health Emergency Powers Act.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state hasn‚Äôt seen a coronavirus resurgence in the weeks since most counties began to slowly reopen businesses, the state‚Äôs top health official said Wednesday. Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen spoke of declining hospitalizations and infection rates as evidence that the spread of COVID-19 remains mild, even as new reported cases increased slightly in recent days, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Allen credited Oregonians for taking steps to reduce their risk of infection, such as wearing face coverings in public and continuing to practice social distancing. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs safe to say our situation is stable,‚Äù he said in a news conference with Gov. Kate Brown. ‚ÄúAs stores, salons and restaurants have reopened across the state, COVID-19 has not reemerged with renewed ferocity.‚Äù Throughout the pandemic, Oregon has had one of the nation‚Äôs lowest infection and death rates among known cases.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The coronavirus has infected another 537 people and killed another 75 in Pennsylvania, the state Health Department said Thursday, even as the rate of new cases and the percentage of those testing positive continues to decline. The agency said it has now confirmed nearly 74,000 cases and a total of 5,817 deaths because of the virus in Pennsylvania in the past three months. On Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf‚Äôs administration is expected to lift more restrictions, as it previously announced it would. Nearly 6 million people in Philadelphia and seven other counties in hard-hit southeastern Pennsylvania are scheduled Friday to become the last in the state to shed the tightest restrictions under Wolf‚Äôs stoplight-colored three-phase reopening plan. That includes the stay-at-home order that is part of the so-called red phase.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State Department of Health staff will be posted to all future peaceful protests seeking justice in the death of George Floyd to help reduce the chances that the coronavirus spreads at them, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. The staff will distribute masks and provide information about symptom monitoring and how to get tested, the Democratic governor said. Raimondo said while she supports the constitutional rights of people to demonstrate, she is concerned about large gatherings leading to an outbreak of the disease. ‚ÄúI feel like these protests should be allowed to occur ‚Ä¶ so that people can participate in democracy and advocate for change,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHaving said that, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we can forget that the virus still with us.‚Äù She also asked protesters to think of their families, especially if they live with any older, vulnerable relatives.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State health officials issued a warning Wednesday that people who go to graduations, businesses or other recently opened places and aren‚Äôt careful about wearing masks or social distancing may be contributing to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the state. But they also said the state likely won‚Äôt shut down businesses again, saying damaging the economy doesn‚Äôt help anyone. People need to take responsibility for their own safety, they said. For the past week, health officials had mostly blamed a significant increase in testing for the spiked numbers. But the messaging changed Wednesday. They cited people not taking precautions at graduation parties and other large gatherings as a possible contributor and urged people to wash their hands, wear masks in public, keep 6 feet away from others and stay at home when possible. ‚ÄúPeople are getting pretty comfortable with being out and about and not practicing social distancing and not wearing a mask,‚Äù said Dr. Joan Duwve, Director of Public Health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state on Thursday reported two new deaths from COVID-19, bringing its death toll to 64, according to the Department of Health. The state also reported 85 new cases of the virus and has recorded 5,247 cases so far. About 80% of those have recovered, but 86 people are currently hospitalized with COVID-19. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has remained mostly constant at about 64 per day. One person who died was in their 60s, and the other was over the age of 80. The economic impacts of the pandemic continued to cause layoffs in the state as 1,435 people made new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 30. But that was a decrease of new claims by more than half from the previous week. A total of 19,593 people in South Dakota were receiving unemployment benefits as of May 23. That represents 4.7% of all eligible employees in the state.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The state delivered unemployment payments to more than 314,000 people last week, as the number of new jobless claims continued to run much higher than normal during the response to the new coronavirus outbreak. Stay-at-home orders from Gov. Bill Lee and city and county officials in mid-March led to business closures and hundreds of thousands of layoffs, as officials scrambled to stem the rise of COVID-19. Businesses have begun to gradually reopen in recent weeks, and many workers have been able to return to their jobs. But the number of new weekly filings is still high, with some businesses remaining closed and employers cutting staff as they operate at a limited capacity due to social distancing rules. More than 22,700 new unemployment claims were filed during the week ending Saturday, the Tennessee Department of Labor & Workforce Development said Thursday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Bars, restaurants and retailers will be allowed to serve more customers ‚Äì in some cases immediately ‚Äì under new orders from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday to further open the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott‚Äôs order for ‚ÄúPhase 3‚Äù of the restart also allows for outdoor Fourth of July celebrations of 500 or more at the discretion of local officials. Retailers are allowed to expand to 50% capacity immediately, and the same applies to bars as long as patrons are seated. Restaurants can serve groups as large as 10 and can expand to 75% total capacity starting June 12. The order also allows amusement parks to gradually expand capacity. All are supposed to follow health and social distancing standards recommended by state and federal officials. The new order comes just three days after the state set a single-day high of positive tests. Texas has reported three of its four highest days of positive tests since March within the past week.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Thursday that it will hold its twice-yearly signature conference in October without an in-person audience, as it did in April, because of lingering concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The conferences usually bring some 100,000 people to the church conference center in Salt Lake City to attend five sessions over two days. Instead, church leaders will be inside a small auditorium with only a few other people Oct. 3-4 as the speeches are broadcast live online around the world. ‚ÄúAs a worldwide organization, we have an obligation to be good citizens and to act with caution as it relates to such a unique setting as general conference, which traditionally brings thousands of visitors to Salt Lake City from around the globe,‚Äù the church‚Äôs top leaders said in a letter to members.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Testing for COVID-19 is available to college students returning to the University of Vermont and Champlain College. The specimen collection is being done by the Vermont Department of Health with help from trained members of the Vermont National Guard at sites on the UVM campus. Testing for UVM students starts Monday and will continue weekdays through June 16. Champlain College students can get tested on June 9, 11 and 16. The Champlain Student Health Center is coordinating the testing for Champlain students. Testing hours are 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at all sites. Local residents may also get tested June 3-6 and June 17-19. Appointments are needed for all tests. UVM students may make an appointment through the school‚Äôs MyWellbeing secure health information portal. Champlain students can call the student health center to sign up, and area residents can register online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: The town is working with the county to support local businesses hit hard by the novel coronavirus pandemic. At its meeting this week, the town council agreed that hotels, motels, restaurants and other businesses affected by the virus should be given as much support as possible through the federal CARES Act. During the meeting, council members discussed how funding from the CARES Act will be used to support the town. Town manager Mike Tolbert explained that Accomack County will receive money first, and citizens of the county, including Chincoteague, will be able to request funding to assist their business. Tolbert added that nonprofits will not qualify for funding from the CARES Act and that the county‚Äôs plan is to work on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city‚Äôs school district says it will soon decide how the next school year will operate given the current coronavirus pandemic. The district moved largely online since it first shut down all buildings March 12 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Gov. Jay Inslee on April 6 issued an emergency order to keep schools across the state closed through the end of the school year. Washington state‚Äôs largest school system, which has about 50,000 students, announced Tuesday that it‚Äôs considering three options, including fully remote learning. Seattle Public Schools is also considering an option for the fall that would have children in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade on campus full time, while students in middle and high school would take on an alternating schedule in which they would spend part of their time in-person, and the other part would be remote learning. The third option is for all students to split their time between the classroom and online.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: About 4,500 West Virginians filed for unemployment aid last week despite the gradual reopening of businesses in the state, according to federal statistics released Thursday. The filings are slightly down from the previous week, though they remain historically high. State officials said they have received 250,000 unemployment claims in the past 10 weeks. West Virginia‚Äôs unemployment rate hit 15% in April, the last recorded month. Nationwide, nearly 1.9 million people filed for jobless benefits last week. Thursday‚Äôs latest weekly number from the U.S. Department of Labor is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has allowed most businesses to reopen under his phased plan to lift virus restrictions. On Friday, casinos and movie theaters can resume operations. Justice on Thursday also announced that fairs and festivals can begin again July 1.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The lakeside festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Milwaukee each summer has canceled the event after earlier moving it to September. Summerfest officials said Thursday that out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution‚Äù for fans, artists, vendors and staff, the event will not take place this year. Summerfest CEO Don Smiley said staff explored numerous options to operate the festival in a safe manner in light of the coronavirus outbreak but could not find acceptable alternatives. Summerfest, which bills itself as the world‚Äôs largest music festival, said it has a $186 million economic impact annually. Organizers were to unveil the new $53 million American Family Insurance Amphitheater during the festival this year. Summerfest, which began in 1968, is held at Henry Maier Festival Park, adjacent to Lake Michigan. It draws 800,000 to 900,000 people each summer.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Applications for temporary unemployment assistance in the state declined during the week ending May 30 as the U.S. economy continued to struggle with measures to contain the coronavirus, officials said Thursday. The number of applications submitted in Wyoming fell to 1,926, down 31% from the previous week but still up 338% compared to the same week last year, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. Wyoming has processed 43,444 claims for unemployment since March 14. That represents 16% of Wyoming‚Äôs total workforce eligible for the unemployment insurance program. Wyoming‚Äôs fossil-fuel extraction and tourism industries have been especially hard-hit by the coronavirus. Coal companies have laid off or furloughed hundreds of workers amid a decline in demand for electricity. Many restaurants and lodges remain closed.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/opinions/liz-cheney-seat-loss-wierson-honan/index.html", "title": "Opinion: In Cheney's loss, Biden has an opportunity | CNN", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Arick Wierson is an Emmy Award-winning television producer and former senior media adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

And they might be right. But Liz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset; rather, she plans to ‚Äúdo whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.‚Äù\n\nArick Wierson Tunheim\n\nNo longer chained to a party whose leaders have abandoned its core values and principles, Cheney is now poised to become the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics. Like Kenobi‚Äôs famous line in ‚ÄúStar Wars,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,‚Äù uttered moments before he‚Äôs killed by Darth Vader, the same can now also be said about Cheney.\n\nBradley Honan c/o Bradley Honan\n\nBut with her rejection from Republican voters in Wyoming comes an unparalleled opportunity for President Joe Biden and the Democrats, and one they should not squander.\n\nAs a conservative with a dynastic last name who, in this hyper-partisan climate, wields uncommon and genuine respect on both sides of the aisle, Cheney would be a valuable addition to the Biden administration. The President should appoint her as a cabinet-level czar on election integrity and the preservation of democracy once her term is up in January. Creating this post would allow her to continue the work she so adroitly began as the co-chair of the January 6th Committee and empower her to fight against the violent and pseudo-autocratic undercurrents that have seeped into conservative politics and pose a real existential threat to our democracy.\n\nWe don‚Äôt agree with much, if any, of Cheney‚Äôs politics, but at this point, when our democracy is hanging on by a bare thread, principles trump policy, and we commend Cheney for sticking to her guns amid a hail of incoming fire.\n\nSadly, Cheney was one of the last Republicans standing among those who voted to impeach Trump. Regardless what anyone thinks of her political stances, Cheney has displayed courageous leadership in the face of staunch opposition and even threats to her physical safety. She has proven her mettle as an unapologetic defender of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn her concession speech on Tuesday, Cheney made no formal commitments about what the future may hold for her beyond her work as co-chair of the January 6th Committee, but her speech left the door wide open for any number of moves down the road.\n\nShe invoked the name of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who lost a US Senate bid only a few years before winning the presidency ‚Äì a move that surely added to already rampant speculation that she too might seek the nation‚Äôs highest office.\n\nBut should Trump declare himself a presidential candidate for 2024, a Cheney run in a Republican primary would likely be nothing more than a constant irritant. She would likely use the megaphone that comes with a national profile to blanket the media with strong anti-Trump messaging and truth telling in the hopes of chipping away at the former President‚Äôs support among those who might be on the fence about backing him a third time.\n\nBut primarying Trump is not Cheney‚Äôs best play. Nor is running as an independent, a move that might actually serve Trump‚Äôs interests by splitting the conservative anti-Trump vote. And certainly, what the country does not need is another ex-pol turned TV pundit.\n\nCheney‚Äôs smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSuch a move by Biden certainly has ample precedent. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed notable Republicans to serve in their Cabinets. The symbolism of bringing members from an opposing party into an administration is a strong signal of bipartisanship, putting the country ahead of party. Placing a high-profile conservative like Cheney in a senior-level position would be a powerful signal to our nation‚Äôs shared, bipartisan commitment to the rule of law and the right to free and fair elections.\n\nThis is a perilous time for our democracy, and Biden should recognize that Cheney can be a national force for good by taking the helm of our nation‚Äôs fight to push back the dark, homegrown forces and ideologies that threaten our future. It‚Äôs clear that, despite her Tuesday night primary defeat, her star continues to shine brightly.\n\nBiden would be well-served to act decisively and harness her star power.", "authors": ["Arick Wierson Bradley Honan", "Arick Wierson", "Bradley Honan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/opinions/monkeypox-vaccine-distribution-das/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The problem with monkeypox vaccine distribution | CNN", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Lala Tanmoy (Tom) Das is an MD-PhD student at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who has been barred from blood donation for being gay. Follow him @TanmoyDasLala. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN ‚Äî\n\nI‚Äôve struck out three times trying to get a monkeypox vaccine appointment in New York City.\n\nI tried and tried again, but between dwindling supplies, huge demand and difficulties with the appointment website, each time I failed.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said that 9,200 vaccination appointments were fully booked in just seven minutes after they went online last week. It should come as no surprise, then, that New York City‚Äôs health department decided to switch its two-dose vaccination strategy to a one-dose strategy. Vasan said the agency hasn‚Äôt scrapped the second shot but is focusing on first shots for now.\n\nLala Tanmoy Das Patricia Kuharic/WCMC Photography\n\nThe demand outpacing supply is a problem we could have prevented; demand was and is largely predictable as cases in the US are still mostly limited to men who have sex with men (MSM) ‚Äì many of whom self-identify as gay, bisexual or transgender. And studies consistently show that LGBTQ individuals are much more likely to get vaccinated than our heterosexual peers ‚Äì including getting the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is an urgent need to fast-track the delivery and distribution of more vaccines. But, as a gay physician-in-training who has taken care of LGBT people in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods, I am worried that our current approach to rationing available vaccine reserves is not equitable and disadvantages individuals who may need it the most.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to prioritize vaccine distribution in Black and brown communities. This includes not just opening up sites in predominantly minority neighborhoods but ensuring that people who live there can access them. Latest surveillance data from the NYC Department of Health shows that non-white individuals make up a larger share of known monkeypox cases than white individuals. Additionally, 2 out of every 5 cases are outside Manhattan and Staten Island, in boroughs that are predominantly non-white. Other cities, like Atlanta, appear to have a similar racial/ethnic disparity among known cases, with Black individuals being impacted more.\n\nYet, based on what I‚Äôve heard from Black and brown peers and patients, and corroborated by what‚Äôs being anecdotally reported on social media, people of color seem to be having a very difficult time securing vaccination appointments. As more doses become available in the future, we need to adjust our distribution strategies so that these individuals and their communities are not further stymied. Releasing anonymized sociodemographic information on who is getting the vaccines and in which neighborhoods may help ensure that minority neighborhoods are being reached.\n\nWe also need to supplement the current approach in many cities of first-come-first-served, online-only scheduling portals with pre-registration (like Washington, DC is doing) and walk-in options. As we witnessed with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, the online, first-come-first-served system disadvantages anyone who has work or other obligations that prevent them from getting online the minute appointments are released, as well as people with unstable housing who don‚Äôt often have access to digital technology.\n\nThere are also still a fair number of MSM who prioritize anonymity and discretion over health. I‚Äôve seen this not only in my own patient pool but in conversations with people online. Many of these individuals don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the digital traceability of online portals. We are doing a disservice to people if we don‚Äôt employ different, more discreet strategies such as walk-in appointments with no online registration.\n\nLanguage equity, too, is important when disseminating information on vaccine updates, especially in urban centers like New York, which are linguistically diverse. I know several gay men who only speak Mandarin or Portuguese and who have struggled to understand the updates released about vaccine availability. Though webpages can often be translated, cities should look into ensuring that monkeypox information and updates about vaccine availability are efficiently and accurately reaching those who are not native English speakers.\n\nFinally, current eligibility criteria encourages people with immunocompromising conditions to seek out vaccines, but they are not afforded priority in a first-come-first-served scheduling portal despite the fact that some early data indicates that those who are immunocompromised ‚Äì including from uncontrolled or poorly controlled HIV ‚Äì may have more serious outcomes from monkeypox. We should prioritize vaccinations for these individuals.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe monkeypox situation is rapidly evolving. In New York City, we went from one case in May to over 600 in mid-July. And even though a majority of known cases have been in adult men, Dr. Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, mentioned in a recent town hall that health authorities are starting to see cases in children. Renewed emphasis on vaccination as well as primary prevention will be critical to curbing the spread of the virus in different groups.\n\nThere is no perfect, one-size-fits all solution to vaccine distribution challenges that will cater to everyone‚Äôs needs. But it is especially important to me, as an immigrant and a physician-in-training, to be able to advocate for the needs of disadvantaged groups that I serve. I must vouch for their visibility in the public health system to help ensure that access to resources is equitable for all New Yorkers.", "authors": ["Lala Tanmoy Das"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/08/state-cheese-awol-animals-editor-jailed-news-around-states/117415210/", "title": "State cheese, AWOL animals: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Legislative leaders are continuing to discuss prison construction and renovation alternatives, including whether pandemic relief funds can be used to offset costs or renovating and building prisons. Key lawmakers say they expect to continue discussions this month in advance of a possible special session later in the year. ‚ÄúI think the House and Senate are pretty close to an agreement,‚Äù said Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House General Fund budget committee. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of legislators want to move forward with a bond proposal and for us to own the prisons.‚Äù Clouse and Sen. Greg Albritton, chairman of the Senate General Fund budget committee, said a topic under discussion is whether federal funds from the American Rescue Plan may be used to offset some of the costs or do renovations. States can use that money for a wide range of uses to contend with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Albritton said the state is trying to get clarity on ‚Äúwhat can we do with the recovery money.‚Äù Lawmakers are looking for more options after Gov. Kay Ivey‚Äôs plan to rent prisons, which would be run by the state but built and owned by private companies, fell apart because of financing concerns. However, federal officials have been clear that new facilities will not solve the state‚Äôs prison woes.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A wildfire burned close to a vacation destination Tuesday, but fire officials believed Chena Hot Springs Resort would be spared. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pretty confident that they‚Äôre going to be able to defend the resort, based on the measures that we‚Äôve set up and the personnel we have on scene,‚Äù said Tim Mowry, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Forestry. Firefighters were working to protect the resort, homes and recreational cabins in the area of interior Alaska about 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks. Flames were about 100 yards from the resort, where crews were spraying water on buildings, the agency said in a statement. Firefighters also conducted a back burn near a trail that leads to two yurts for viewing the northern lights in hopes it would help stop the fire from advancing toward the main buildings. Hoses and sprinklers also were set up at nearby homes and cabins. No structures in the Chena Hot Springs area had burned, fire officials said. Light showers that fell overnight weren‚Äôt enough to put out the fire, but the increased humidity was helping to slow its growth. The Fairbanks North Star Borough on Monday issued a voluntary evacuation order. Alaska State Troopers conducted a survey of homeowners and cabin users and found that about 30 people decided not to leave, along with resort owner Bernie Karl.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials in the city plan to ignore Arizona‚Äôs new ‚ÄúSecond Amendment sanctuary‚Äù law that bars state and local governments from enforcing certain federal gun regulations, possibly setting up a court fight as a growing number of cities and counties in the United States declare themselves similar firearm havens. The move by Democratic Mayor Regina Romero and the City Council again puts Tucson and the Republican-led state at odds over how to regulate gun sales and use. The southern Arizona city has long tried to enforce gun laws stricter than the state‚Äôs, including mandating background checks for guns purchased on city property and destroying seized firearms. Over the years, those measures have been challenged after the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted laws barring the actions. The new action came after GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill in April declaring that Arizona is a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. It was partly a response to the election of President Joe Biden, who has vowed to enact tighter firearms regulations. In a growing movement, at least 1,200 local governments have declared themselves sanctuaries insulated from state and federal gun laws since 2018, when high-profile mass shootings prompted calls for stronger regulations. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force.\n\nArkansas\n\nBeebe: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys for George Floyd‚Äôs family on Tuesday mourned a white Arkansas teenager fatally shot by a sheriff‚Äôs deputy, as they urged support across racial lines for efforts to reform police practices. Sharpton eulogized 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, who was shot and killed by a white Lonoke County sheriff‚Äôs deputy, Sgt. Michael Davis, during a traffic stop June 23 near Cabot, about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. The killing in the predominantly white community has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists such as Sharpton, who said concerns about police tactics aren‚Äôt just limited to the Black community. ‚ÄúThe issue of policing is not about Black and white,‚Äù Sharpton told a packed auditorium at Beebe High School, where Brittain was a rising senior. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about right and wrong.‚Äù Many attending the memorial wore jeans and shirts that read ‚ÄúJustice for Hunter.‚Äù Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week fired Davis for not turning on his body camera until after he had shot Brittain. Staley said the only footage police have is from the aftermath. Arkansas State Police are investigating Brittain‚Äôs death. Authorities have released few details about the shooting. Brittain‚Äôs family has said the teenager was unarmed and was holding a jug of antifreeze when he was shot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill‚Äôs author said Tuesday. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January. The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. ‚ÄúSafe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery,‚Äù Wiener said. Currently the sites are illegal in the United States but legal in Canada. Wiener‚Äôs bill barely cleared the Senate in April. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would ‚Äúestablish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens.‚Äù The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it ‚Äúis very much alive, albeit delayed.‚Äù Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths. His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo will begin vaccinating some of its animals against COVID-19 as early as next week. Zoologists say they have been working with the veterinary vaccine company Zoetis to receive doses for the animals, and primates and carnivores will be first on the list. The veterinary vaccine, which is formulated primarily for mammals, is being developed separate from the ones for human use. Transmission is rare between humans and other species, but there have been several documented cases of COVID-19 in large cats, monkeys and certain rodent populations. ‚ÄúWe know some of those animals ‚Äì like gorillas and tigers, mink, otters ‚Äì can all be infected. But for a lot of these others, we don‚Äôt know what the susceptibility is,‚Äù Dr. Scott Larsen, the zoo‚Äôs vice president of animal health, told KMGH-TV. ‚ÄúFor animals, we want to be able to protect them similar to (how) we‚Äôre trying to protect people.‚Äù Veterinary scientists do not think common house pets like cats or dogs are in significant danger of catching COVID-19. ‚ÄúThere are 85 million dogs in the United States and 90 million cats,‚Äù said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary in Denver. ‚ÄúIf we were going to see problems ‚Ä¶ I think we would be seeing it.‚Äù\n\nConnecticut\n\nGuilford: The state‚Äôs newest climate change legislation should put it in a good position to receive millions of dollars in anticipated federal funds to help foot the bill for expensive resiliency projects needed across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials said Tuesday. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said the $30 million in bonding included in the new state budget to help municipalities identify and plan for such projects, including green infrastructure, will also give Connecticut a leg up on other states. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be shovel-ready. We‚Äôll be at the front of the line,‚Äù Dykes said during a bill-signing event at a beach in Guilford. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a lot of dollars to help protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. And the best way to do that, dollars we really want to put to work, are federal dollars.‚Äù Curt Johnson, president of the environmental group Save the Sound, predicted Connecticut will receive $3 or $4 in federal funds for every $1 the state spends on these resiliency efforts. The new law gives all cities and towns, not just certain ones, the ability to establish stormwater authorities. Additionally, the law expands the duties of the 10-year-old Connecticut Green Bank, a first-in-the-nation entity.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two deadly species of hemlock have been found in Delaware, and the state‚Äôs Department of Agriculture is warning people to avoid plants that look like wild carrots to prevent the possibility of being poisoned. Environmental scientists confirmed that poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock were located in Sussex County wetlands, according to a news release from the agency. Both plants have small white flowers and bloom between June and August. Poison hemlock also grows in meadows, pastures and ditches. The invasive plant can reach between 6 and 8 feet tall and has a hairless stem with purple blotches. The department said this type of hemlock releases an odor but shouldn‚Äôt be crushed to smell because toxic oils can be emitted. Spotted water hemlock is a native plant and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its stems vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, and it has fern-like leaves. People who think they found either plant can email pictures to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification. The Agriculture Department said residents shouldn‚Äôt try to eradicate the hemlocks themselves and should instead find a licensed aquatic pest control company to treat them. It also advised against mowing the plants, which can release toxic particles into the air.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Parking in the nation‚Äôs capital is often a nightmare for residents and especially for their guests, but D.C. has launched an easier visitor parking pass program, WUSA-TV reports. When the visitor parking pass was launched in 2013, it was met with widespread opposition. With the new program, people can register for the annual pass allowing their guests to park for two hours in a residential permit parking zone in all eight wards. ‚ÄúThe intent of the system is to make getting a visitor parking permit easier and also to reduce parking congestion in residential areas,‚Äù said Everett Lott, acting director for the District Department of Transportation. The new online parking portal now allows people to print out their own parking permits for visitors and can be accessed through the portal provided by D.C. online or through an app on Apple or Android phones. ‚ÄúThis particular system, the automated system, is connected to the resident and to the license plate,‚Äù Lott said. ‚ÄúSo it makes it a lot more user-friendly but also helps to eliminate any of the abuse that was possible in the past.‚Äù Parking permits, which must be displayed prominently on the windshield of vehicles, can be printed at home, at D.C. Public Library branches, or at kiosks at DDOT Headquarters, the DDOT Permit Office and Metropolitan Police Department precincts.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A couple is suing a Catholic school and demanding the return of a large donation, saying it isn‚Äôt adhering to Catholic values because of the way it‚Äôs handling issues like race and accepting the LGBTQ community. Anthony and Barbara Scarpo filed their lawsuit against the Academy of the Holy Names last month after one of their daughters graduated and a second transferred to another school, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The lawsuit comes four years after the couple pledged $1.35 million to the school, which named its theater for the family. The couple claims the school has ‚Äúlost its way‚Äù by distancing itself from mainstream Catholicism and embracing a ‚Äúwoke culture‚Äù in which priority is given to ‚Äúgender identity, human sexuality and pregnancy termination among other hot button issues.‚Äù The suit also takes issue with a blackboard in a common area that explains how to be an ally to the LGBTQ community, as well as how the school takes on the issue of race, saying white students are made to feel guilty. The Scarpos had paid $240,000 toward the pledge as of 2018, the lawsuit said. The school didn‚Äôt discuss details of the suit, but spokeswoman Emily Wise told the Times in an email that the school‚Äôs curriculum is based on Catholic values.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block some challenged sections of Georgia‚Äôs new election law ahead of two runoff elections next week, but he didn‚Äôt rule out the possibility for future elections. Election integrity activists had asked U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee to prohibit the state from enforcing sections of the new law that have to do with observation of elections, as well as a new deadline for requesting absentee ballots. Their request arose from one of eight federal lawsuits challenging the new law. The Republican-backed overhaul of election rules enacted this year has been blasted by Democrats and others who say it creates unnecessary obstacles to voting, particularly for people of color. Most of the lawsuits, including one filed last month by the U.S. Department of Justice, challenge the parts of law that critics say threaten voting rights. The targeted request that led to Wednesday‚Äôs ruling, though, focused on provisions mostly related to monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The activists, led by the Coalition for Good Governance, said those sections criminalize normal election observation activities and could intimidate voters, election observers and members of the news media. A tighter absentee ballot request deadline makes it virtually impossible to get one for a runoff, they argue.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers on Tuesday overrode Gov. David Ige‚Äôs veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax on hotel stays and other short-term rentals. Instead, lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. Further, instead of providing the state‚Äôs four major counties with a share of transient accommodations tax revenue, the legislation gives the counties the authority to levy their own surcharge to the tax. Currently, the state charges one uniform hotel tax rate across the islands. Sen. Bennette Misalucha, vice chair of the Senate‚Äôs Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism Committee, said special funds shouldn‚Äôt be protected for the benefit of one industry. She said the Legislature brought special funds like hotel tax revenue into the general fund to stop this practice. The Hawaii Tourism Authority will now be required to get support from lawmakers for its budget just like other state agencies, she said, which will require the agency to be more forthcoming with its strategic plans and force more communication between the agency and lawmakers.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d‚ÄôAlene: High housing prices in northern Idaho are making it difficult to attract police officers, law enforcement officials say. Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Police Capt. Dave Hagar told the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Press that low crime rates and an outdoor lifestyle are big draws but that skyrocketing housing prices are turning people away. ‚ÄúFive years ago, the cost of living in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene was much more reasonable,‚Äù Hagar said. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs gone above that.‚Äù The Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Association of Realtors said the median residential home sale price was $476,000 in March. That‚Äôs a 47% increase from a year ago. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said his agency has recruited new hires only to have them decline the job after discovering they couldn‚Äôt afford housing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a significant barrier,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe housing situation is severe.‚Äù The agency is looking to hire deputies, dispatchers, control room operators, clerks and jail staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to attract local candidates,‚Äù Norris said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do that when some of our pay is $14 or $15 an hour.‚Äù Kootenai County Commissioner Bill Brooks said other county agencies are also having a hard time finding and retaining workers. Wages once considered normal are now not enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city‚Äôs schools will encourage student COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the start of the school year with school-based vaccination sites and events, officials announced Wednesday. Officials with the nation‚Äôs third-largest school district plan to offer full in-person instruction in the fall and want to vaccinate as many students as possible before classes begin next month. District officials said they are ‚Äúnot in a position‚Äù to mandate COVID-19 shots but will ask families to submit COVID-19 vaccine documents, as is the practice with other immunizations. Starting next week, the district will offer vaccines at three school sites for students and their families. The sites will be able to administer 600 doses weekly. The district is also working with hospitals for events in areas with low inoculation rates and offering the shots at back-to-school events. ‚ÄúSchools are trusted pillars of our communities, and as a district we are uniquely suited to help expand vaccination opportunities, which helps create the safest possible learning environments at our schools,‚Äù said Jose M. Torres, interim schools CEO. More than 50,000 children under the age of 18 have already been vaccinated in Chicago, according to the city‚Äôs Department of Public Health. Roughly 350,000 students attend Chicago Public Schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As federal officials debate pouring billions of dollars into broadband access, data suggests many of Indiana‚Äôs schoolchildren and adults who preferred to work from home spent the pandemic with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state‚Äôs least-wealthy counties. In about half of Indiana‚Äôs counties ‚Äì 47 of 92 ‚Äì measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 79% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft ‚Äì 47 of 92 counties ‚Äì no more than 22% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of Senate moderates have reached a deal on a far-reaching infrastructure plan that would direct $65 billion to increase broadband connectivity from coast to coast. Despite the agreement, it‚Äôs unclear whether it would address the solutions some lawmakers want to see such as continued broadband subsidies for low-income families, greater competition among wireless providers, and continued buildout of high-speed networks in poorer, rural areas. In Indiana, 12.4% of residents don‚Äôt have adequate broadband infrastructure, and 48.4% live in areas with only one internet provider, according to the White House.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A teenager injured in an accident on an amusement ride that killed his younger brother remained on life support Wednesday as he turned 16, his family pastor said. David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children‚Äôs Hospital since Saturday‚Äôs accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said. David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said. The pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids said it‚Äôs a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church, which planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night, is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000. Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David‚Äôs birthday, but ‚Äúthere won‚Äôt be a lot of celebrating,‚Äù Shields said. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland on Saturday to celebrate David‚Äôs upcoming birthday. The junior at Linn-Mar High School had been excited about getting his driver‚Äôs license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has expanded the paid leave that state employees can take from their jobs when they become parents or act as caregivers. Kelly issued an executive order Tuesday that provides an extra two weeks of paid leave for state workers who are a child‚Äôs primary caregiver and an extra week for secondary caregivers. The order also makes foster parents eligible for the same paid leave. Primary caregivers will now receive up to eight weeks of paid leave, rather than six. Secondary caregivers will receive four weeks instead of three. The order directed the state Department of Administration to put the new policies into effect immediately. Kelly said the state is demonstrating a commitment to recruiting and keeping talented workers and creating a ‚Äúsupportive environment for our families.‚Äù ‚ÄúSupporting working parents in our workforce is not only the right thing to do,‚Äù Kelly said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for our economy.‚Äù The order also says new state employees become eligible for paid leave after 180 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: After years of planning and public input, the construction phase of the Sherman Minton Bridge rehabilitation project will soon be underway. The Sherman Minton Renewal project team said Tuesday that it will begin working on ramp improvements next week. The improvements ‚Äúare being made to prepare for the first phase of the rehabilitation, which will include the first half of eastbound construction on the lower deck and painting of the bridge trusses,‚Äù according to a news release. According to the team, ramp shoulders at the Interstates 65 and 265 interchange, as well as the Interstates 64 and 265 interchange, will be modified to accommodate additional traffic. The modification process will take one to two weeks, the team said, and ‚Äúwill require nighttime lane closures and/or ramp closures to construct.‚Äù After the ramp improvements are completed, traffic will be reduced to two lanes in each direction as the team works on painting and deck replacement preparations. When lanes are restricted, I-65 and I-265 will serve as a detour route, the team said. The Sherman Minton, which spans the Ohio River to connect the Bluegrass and Hoosier states, is 59 years old. The proposal to rehabilitate the double-decker bridge was announced in 2018. The price tag for the project is roughly $137 million.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities say they‚Äôve been searching for a 12-foot python that escaped from its enclosure inside the state‚Äôs largest shopping mall. Cara, a yellow and white Burmese python, slithered out of its enclosure at the Blue Zoo in the Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, news outlets report. She was still on the loose early Wednesday morning, WBRZ-TV reports, after a search overnight, when such snakes are most active. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôve created a very secure home for Cara, our Burmese Python, she has slithered out of her exhibit,‚Äù the Blue Zoo said in a statement. ‚ÄúCara is a non-poisonous, friendly snake that enjoys her time interacting with guests during our Snake Education Shows.‚Äù Pythons slowly squeeze their prey to death before swallowing them. Cara was described as ‚Äúvery sweet‚Äù by her handlers, who released a photo of the animal. The Blue Zoo ‚Äì which bills itself as ‚Äúmore than an aquarium, more than a zoo‚Äù ‚Äì was closed Tuesday while search efforts continued, but the Mall of Louisiana remained open.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Enrollment in public schools across the state dropped by 4.4%, nearly 8,000 students, between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, according to Maine Department of Education data. Most of those students transitioned to home schooling, which saw an increase of 5,000 students, according to department data. School systems expect many students to return for the 2021-22 school year, Bangor Daily News reports. According to an Education Week report, Maine had the fourth-highest decrease in the nation behind Vermont‚Äôs 5.3% decrease, Mississippi‚Äôs 5% drop and New Hampshire‚Äôs 4.7% decline. Steve Bailey, executive director at Maine School Management Association, said the change reflects concerns from parents about safety during the pandemic and child care challenges. The most significant decrease was in prekindergarten and kindergarten students, for whom the population decreased by 16%, compared to a 3% decrease in all other students.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: Teenagers will be entered to win $50,000 college scholarships if they get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state‚Äôs latest incentive program offered to encourage as many people as possible to get the shots. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the new lottery program Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. Twenty Marylanders between the ages of 12 and 17 will win scholarships worth $50,000 each between now and Labor Day. The program will give away a total of $1 million in scholarships or the equivalent of full tuition and fees at one of Maryland‚Äôs public universities. Winners who choose to attend college out of state can transfer the scholarship to the school of their choice, Hogan said. The program will begin Monday and continue through Labor Day. Teens who have been vaccinated in Maryland are eligible and will be automatically entered, the governor said. Winners will be chosen using the same process as ‚ÄúVaxCash,‚Äù a lottery for adults that recently ended. That program awarded a total of $2 million in prizes to Marylanders 18 and older who had received a COVID-19 vaccine at any time. The scholarship prizes will be deposited into college savings accounts with Maryland 529.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nTopsfield: A more than 200-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is scheduled to return this fall, organizers announced Wednesday. The 11-day Topsfield Fair, first held in 1818, will start Oct. 1, the Essex Agricultural Society said in a statement. ‚ÄúHaving to cancel last year‚Äôs Topsfield Fair due to the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating,‚Äù General Manager James O‚ÄôBrien said. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to announce that the fair will return this year with no restrictions, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the fairgrounds in October.‚Äù The fair was previously canceled for three years during World War II and in 1918 because of an influenza pandemic. Based on attendance in 1946 after the three-year shutdown, O‚ÄôBrien said he expects high attendance this fall. In anticipation, fair personnel have installed extra sinks and hand-sanitizing stations around the fairgrounds north of Boston, he said. One of the fair‚Äôs most popular events is the giant pumpkin contest, but it also includes livestock exhibits, a midway, vendors, food stalls and live music. It typically draws up to 500,000 visitors per year. A schedule for concerts, which are free with fair admission, will be announced soon.\n\nMichigan\n\nRoseville: CARE of Southeastern Michigan is hosting a free, two-week day camp for kids whose family members struggle with addiction. Open for children in preschool through eighth grade, Camp CARE will address communicating effectively, managing emotions, dealing with change, choosing friends wisely, resisting peer pressure and more. The skills are taught through hands-on activities like arts, crafts and games, said CARE director of substance use prevention Kaitlin Maloziec. The Roseville fire and police departments will also visit the camp for a teaching segment in the city about 15 miles northeast of Detroit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a spot where kids can be kids, make friendships and see that they‚Äôre not alone,‚Äù Maloziec said. The camp will be held at Fountain Elementary in Roseville from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 19-23 and July 26-30. Zoom sessions for parents and caregivers will teach adults some of the same skills as the youth, along with parenting tips and advice on how to talk about addiction and address kids‚Äô questions. The camp, which Maloziec said has been around for more than two decades, is hosting up to 60 students this year. Most activities will be held outdoors, with mask-wearing required and lunch provided. Registration is available online and closes at 11:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: With COVID-19 limits fading away, tourists are returning to Minnesota resorts, many of them from neighboring states. But a lot of employees are not coming back. The worker shortage has been building for more than a year, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for Hospitality Minnesota, the trade association for the state‚Äôs hotels, restaurants, resorts and campgrounds. The industry is down about 50,000 workers from its normal summer level of 280,000 to 290,000 workers. Many of them found other jobs during the first COVID-19 shutdown, and others left when a second hospitality shutdown was ordered, the Star Tribune reports. ‚ÄúAfter last year, we were hopeful that things would get back to normal,‚Äù said Sue Dutcher, manager of the St. Croix River Resort in Hinckley. Instead, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre being run ragged.‚Äù In Detroit Lakes, Joanne Anderson faces a similar challenge at the Forest Hills Resort. Anderson manages Izzo‚Äôs, the resort‚Äôs bar and restaurant, and is running it with eight workers instead of the usual 20. Some operators have been fortunate enough to escape the labor shortage. The Trail Center Lodge on the Gunflint Trail is ‚Äú100% staffed,‚Äù according to owner Sarah Hamilton. That‚Äôs partly due to a new program that brings young adults from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to work at businesses on the North Shore.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Farmers in the state are losing the catfish wars against their foreign competitors with the very weapon they saw as their salvation. The domestic catfish industry, along with lawmakers including the late U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, lobbied to move oversight of catfish processing from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture five years ago with the expectation the USDA‚Äôs stricter eye would limit the foreign imports that had decimated domestic production throughout the Mississippi Delta. Instead, imports of siluriformes ‚Äì the larger category of catfish and catfish-like fish sometimes referred to by their family name, ‚Äúpangasius‚Äù ‚Äì have only increased since the switch to the USDA‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2016. Meanwhile, domestic prices and production, mainly in Mississippi and other Southern states, have continued to decline. Almost 65,000 additional tons of catfish were imported in 2019 compared to 2015 before the Food Safety and Inspection Service took over, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration‚Äôs National Marine Fisheries Service. The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce lists recent processing volumes at 5 million pounds per month less than in 2015 during FDA oversight.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Seventeen more people in southwest Missouri died from COVID-19 in a two-week period ending Sunday as the coronavirus continues to surge in the region, officials said. The deaths were recorded in the two-week reporting period from June 21 to July 4 and were disclosed Tuesday by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, the Kansas City Star reports. The dead ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and none of those who died was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday told reporters that his administration has done ‚Äúeverything possible‚Äù to fend off outbreaks. Missouri has reported nearly 530,000 cases of the virus and 9,375 deaths since the pandemic began. The state has administered more than 5 million doses, with 44.9% of the population getting at least one. Parson said he‚Äôs focused on encouraging people to get inoculated and making the shots available to them. He said he‚Äôs still wary of incentivizing vaccinations with prizes. ‚ÄúRight now, the vaccine‚Äôs out there,‚Äù Parson said. ‚ÄúI mean, people walk past it every day, whether they‚Äôre in a pharmacy, whether they‚Äôre in a Walmart, whether they‚Äôre in a health center.‚Äù Parson also on Wednesday signed a bill into law to limit lawsuits against companies for wrongdoing related to the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Wildlife officials were searching by ground and from the air Wednesday for a grizzly bear that killed a woman who was camping. A helicopter was flying over the area around the small town of Ovando, in western Montana, in pursuit of the bear, which will be killed if found, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon said. Large traps made out of culverts were set around the area in hopes of capturing the bruin. Ovando, about 60 miles northwest of Helena, is a community of fewer than 100 people at the edge of the sprawling Bob Marshall wilderness. Long-distance bicyclists such as the victim often spend the night in the town. Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said the bear wandered into the victim‚Äôs camping area a couple of times before Tuesday‚Äôs fatal mauling. Someone at the scene used bear spray, and other campers called 911, Roselles said. Roselles closed down any camping in Ovando as the search for the bear continued, following creeks leading away from the town. Further circumstances surrounding the attack were under investigation. Officials said their priority was to find and kill the bear to prevent another dangerous encounter.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: A tomahawk once owned by Chief Standing Bear, a pioneering Native American civil rights leader, is returning to his Nebraska tribe after decades in a museum at Harvard. The university‚Äôs Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology said it‚Äôs been working with members of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska and Oklahoma to repatriate the artifact. Larry Wright Jr., chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said Tuesday that the return of the historic weapon is a powerful symbol of homecoming for the tribe, which was among many forcibly relocated from their homelands to other territories by the federal government in the 1800s. Standing Bear was arrested 1878 for leaving the tribe‚Äôs reservation in order to fulfill a promise he made to bury his eldest son back in their tribe‚Äôs homeland in the Niobrara River Valley. In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law. ‚ÄúThat hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,‚Äù Standing Bear famously said in court. ‚ÄúThe blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.‚Äù Wright said the tribe is preparing its own museum, located near Standing Bear‚Äôs grave, to properly display the tomahawk and other artifacts.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A 110-acre property at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip has been purchased to be the site for a terminal station for a planned new high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. Brightline Holdings announced the purchase Tuesday without announcing the price, but local news outlets report that Clark County records indicate the purchase by the holding company for Brightline West closed Thursday for $140 million. The site is on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard across from Premium Outlets South mall and near McCarran International Airport. Company officials have said Brightline West trains would carry up to 500 passengers at speeds up to 200 mph on the planned route between Las Vegas and Victorville, California. The project has been delayed over the years, most recently because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Plans to close the state‚Äôs youth detention center are quickly taking shape, with a consultant due to submit a preliminary report in the next two weeks. The two-year state budget Gov. Chris Sununu signed June 25 includes a mandate to close the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester by March 2023. But the state Department of Health and Human Services didn‚Äôt wait for lawmakers and the governor to act; it signed a $55,000 contract with Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services of Washington, D.C., on June 8. The contract, paid for with federal pandemic aid, requires the consultants to deliver a draft closure plan by mid-July and a final report by August. According to details submitted to the governor‚Äôs Executive Council last week, the department didn‚Äôt have time to solicit bids given the time-sensitive work but consulted with stakeholders before hiring the firm. Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette told the council she met with advocates for juvenile justice, including the Disability Rights Center and the Office of the Child Advocate. ‚ÄúWe have this opportunity to build the right-sized program on a clinical model instead of a detention model. So I brought the advocates together to say, ‚ÄòWhat is your ideal model?‚Äô ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey said they weren‚Äôt qualified and that I should hire a consultant. So that is what I did.‚Äù\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater: The pandemic that closed restaurant dining rooms last year also put a stop to food tours. But with eateries up and running again, food tours are starting back up, too, inviting food lovers to explore a town by enjoying its restaurants‚Äô signature dishes and learning about local history. ‚ÄúFor the first time in 15 months, we are opening public tours again, and it is really exciting,‚Äù said Alessia Aron, owner of Beyond the Plate Tours, which presents excursions in Jersey City, Red Bank and Somerville. Local restaurants ‚Äúhave been through hell and back, and we are just trying to support them as much as possible.‚Äù Her company, previously Jersey Girls Food Tours, is one of seven that comprise the NJ Food Tour Trail. ‚ÄúWe thought that coming together and creating the New Jersey Food Tour Trail would help us come out of the pandemic better,‚Äù said Audrey Wiggins, owner of On the Town Food Tours, another participant. ‚ÄúJuly 1 is our official opening date for all tour companies; some have started a little earlier than that, but everyone is now officially open.‚Äù Other NJ Food Tour Trail companies include Asbury Park Food Tours, Cape May Food Tours, Sister Cities Food and Shop Tours, Savor and Stroll Culinary Tours and Have You Met Newark Tours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new podcast called Parks urges visitors to America‚Äôs national parks to educate themselves about and acknowledge the Indigenous tribes whose ties to these sacred spaces span millennia. The aim of the documentary podcast is to explore the history of tribes on these lands, the ways in which the lands were dispossessed, issues the Indigenous communities face today, and how they‚Äôve kept their culture and traditions alive, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much that was written, but when it was written, it was from the point of view of Eastern colonizers,‚Äù said Mary Mathis, 25, a former photo editor at National Public Radio and Outside magazine who serves as the host of Parks, co-created with fellow Santa Fe-based multimedia journalist Cody Nelson. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt every story, it was just one story ‚Äì the quote-unquote ‚Äòwinner‚Äôs‚Äô story. We see that a lot in our education system, and I think that was where the idea (for Parks) kind of came from.‚Äù The first episode follows a format the Parks team plans to replicate throughout the project, one in which Indigenous guests are closely involved in each step of the editing process so as to maintain complete ownership of their stories.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A consortium of businesses and nonprofits will run Central Park‚Äôs Wollman ice rink, one of four recreational concessions that were operated by Donald Trump‚Äôs company until the city canceled its contracts with the former president, the city Department of Parks and Recreation announced Tuesday. A joint venture called Wollman Park Partners LLC is expected to be awarded a five-year contract to run the rink after submitting the winning bid for the project, city officials said. The joint venture, which includes Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, Related Companies, Equinox, caterer Great Performances and local groups such as Ice Hockey in Harlem, will reinvest all profits into upgrading the rink, city officials said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Summer of New York City, but we‚Äôre already preparing for an iconic winter, too,‚Äù Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled that NYC Parks has found a quality operator for Wollman Rink that is committed to reinvesting in the community and creating a welcoming space for all New Yorkers.‚Äù The Democrat announced in January that the city would terminate business contracts with the Trump Organization over Trump‚Äôs role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The cancellations affected a golf course in the Bronx and a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Superior Court judge put a small-town newspaper editor behind bars last month after one of his reporters used an audio recorder for note-taking purposes at a murder trial ‚Äì a punishment the paper and media rights groups consider excessive. Judge Stephan Futrell sentenced Gavin Stone, the news editor of the Richmond County Daily Journal, to five days in jail before having the editor hauled off to jail. Stone was released the next day but still faces the possibility of more time in lockup. Brian Bloom, the paper‚Äôs publisher, acknowledged that his reporter shouldn‚Äôt have had the recorder in court because it was not allowed but criticized the judge‚Äôs move to imprison an editor for a minor infraction committed by a colleague. ‚ÄúThe penalty does not fit the crime,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put this in perspective: You stop a murder trial not once, but twice, because a guy had a tape recorder sitting next to him on a bench at a courtroom. Let‚Äôs put our priorities in place here.‚Äù Futrell did not respond to a request for comment. Superior Court rules allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings but grant judges the authority to prohibit the technology.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: The Mandan City Commission has agreed to equip the community‚Äôs police force with body cameras. The commission approved the cameras unanimously Tuesday with no discussion. The police department received a quote from Digital-Ally, which already has cameras inside the police vehicles. A memo from police to commissioners said that using the same company for the cameras will allow for better integration of the equipment, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The package of 28 body cameras, upgraded in-car cameras, accessories, set-up, training and cloud storage would cost about $165,000 for a five-year subscription. The police department also received approval to request funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to offset the cost of the cameras. It is asking for nearly $37,000 over five years, according to the memo. The Lincoln Police Department began using body cameras in early 2020. The Bismarck Police Department and the Burleigh County Sheriff‚Äôs Department do not use the technology.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The top prosecutor in one of the state‚Äôs most populous counties has decided his office will no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters announced his decision Tuesday, saying it would take effect immediately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for this nonsense to end,‚Äù Deters said. The directive comes in the wake of a violent holiday weekend in Cincinnati. Among the incidents was a Fourth of July shooting at a downtown park where authorities say a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy opened fire on each other, leaving both of them dead and three innocent bystanders wounded. Hundreds of teens were gathered at Smale Park when the shooting occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Sunday, authorities say. At the time, police officers were working to clear out the riverfront park before its closing time. ‚ÄúPeople must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say, ‚ÄòEnough is enough,‚Äô ‚Äù Deters said. ‚ÄúNo amount of money can fix the problems we are facing. Parents must parent their children. Communities must speak up.‚Äù\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe‚Äôs office announced Wednesday that he requested $4 million in federal funds to help combat illegal marijuana growing operations in the state. Inhofe‚Äôs chief of staff, Luke Holland, announced the request during an Oklahoma Sheriffs Association meeting, saying Inhofe requested a direct appropriation through the U.S. Justice Department to allow the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to establish a unit to combat ‚Äútransnational and national drug organizations.‚Äù The unit would work with sheriffs to combat illegal drug operations. Medical marijuana is a booming business in Oklahoma, where voters in 2018 approved one of the nation‚Äôs most liberal medical programs. As a result, out-of-state weed entrepreneurs have flocked to the state to get involved. But sheriffs and other law enforcement groups, which opposed the state question in 2018, have said illegal marijuana grow operations are setting up in rural parts of Oklahoma and funneling cannabis into the illegal drug trade in Oklahoma and other states.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon said Tuesday that it will start the second phase of building the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact after receiving another $500million donation for the project. Construction on the first phase of the new campus started in 2016 ‚Äì after the first half-billion-dollar gift from the Nike co-founder and his wife ‚Äì with a large science building including a pedestrian bridge over the street. A second building for ‚Äúbioengineering and applied science research building to support expanded research programs and facilities‚Äù will be built next, according to a university news release. The building is planned to cover 175,000 square feet, with multiple stories, and be located north of the first building. The focus of the new campus is to translate scientific discoveries into advances in health care and other fields. The latest money will also pay for 14 to 16 additional faculty members and their teams. The new campus currently employs 13 tenure-related faculty members and their research teams, for a total of about 90 employees. ‚ÄúThe aim of the new campus is to compress the timeline between discovery and ‚Äúsocietal impact,‚Äù said Robert Guldberg, vice president and executive director of the new science operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will rise another 5% in January, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday. The agency board voted to impose the higher rates as of Jan. 2. The most common E-ZPass fare for a passenger vehicle will rise by a dime, from $1.60 to $1.70. Those being charged through a scan of their license plate will see the most common fare go from $3.90 to $4.10. The most common truck fare will go from $13 to $13.70 for E-ZPass and from $26.60 to $28 for toll-by-plate. Officials say 2022 will be the first time in six years that fares will have jumped by less than 6%. The turnpike has pumped more than $7 billion in funding from tolls to the state Transportation Department since 2007.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Almost $54 million worth of fraudulent unemployment claims have been filed during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials say. The latest total is about $9 million more than in May, with even more victims coming forward in the past month, according to WJAR-TV. State Department of Labor and Training Director Matt Weldon said that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the claims were filed during that time span, just that they are coming to light now. The agency has managed to get back about $3.75 million so far with the help of federal agencies, but Weldon said he believes that will grow significantly in the coming months. The agency is also enforcing rules that require people to look for work while collecting benefits, he said. With 64,000 Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits, that will be a slow process, with the agency only able to get through a few hundred claims per week to start, he said. ‚ÄúAs you can imagine, trying to audit claims and go through information is difficult when there are more than a workable number, so we are going to begin with hundreds and see how that goes, and then that can grow in the future,‚Äù he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants a new abortion law to take effect, arguing Wednesday that a judge‚Äôs decision to put the whole measure ‚Äì and not just the parts being challenged in court ‚Äì on hold during a lawsuit ‚Äúoversteps the bounds of federal judicial power.‚Äù Gov. Henry McMaster‚Äôs brief with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asks appellate judges to lift a lower court‚Äôs injunction on the South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act. The Republican signed the measure into law earlier this year that requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If cardiac activity is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother‚Äôs life is in danger. Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from going into effect during the litigation. In his brief, attorneys for McMaster argued that decision represents ‚Äúoverreaching federal power to interfere with state law.‚Äù McMaster, along with other defendants including state Attorney General Alan Wilson, also argue that the groups that sued don‚Äôt have proper standing to challenge the law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMadison: An increasing number of primarily social media complaints from residents in Madison and Lake County have brought to light a little-known county ordinance banning people from occupying their campers or recreational vehicles outside the confines of a campground. Lake County Planning and Zoning Officer Mandi Anderson said the ordinance has gone undetected for many years until a recent barrage of postings that have led to heated debate among residents. Some who are opposed to the rule say that it infringes on property rights and that there should be nothing wrong with letting visitors use a camper for a short time. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize it was this out of hand,‚Äù Anderson said. One theory for the ordinance, Anderson said, is that people who construct large lakeside homes on small lots do not want to be inundated with noise from adjoining property when three campers pull in for the weekend and 50 people take up temporary residence, The Madison Daily Leader reports. Anderson said citations are only issued if the matter is not addressed after the property owner has been notified about the ordinance and has been given an opportunity to comply. She emphasized she does not drive around looking for violators but only responds to complaints.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are inviting the public to celebrate and remember civil rights icon John Lewis in a dedication ceremony next week. Earlier this year, Nashville‚Äôs Metro Council renamed a large portion of Fifth Avenue North to Rep. John Lewis Way. Councilwoman Zulfat Suara submitted the request last year, focusing on Lewis‚Äô work to desegregate Nashville‚Äôs lunch counters before becoming a long-serving congressman in Georgia. The city will host a dedication July 16-17. The event was originally scheduled for February but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As a college student at American Baptist College and then Fisk University, Lewis helped desegregate public spaces in Nashville and pushed for racial justice across the South. Lewis was a Freedom Rider, spoke at the March on Washington, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Lewis died July 17, 2020. He was 80.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Air Force is mostly responsible for a former serviceman killing more than two dozen people at a church in 2017 because it failed to submit his criminal history into a database, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms. U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez in San Antonio wrote in a ruling signed Wednesday that the Air Force was ‚Äú60% responsible‚Äù for the massacre at First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, where Devin Kelley opened fire during a Sunday service. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. The attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history. ‚ÄúThe trial conclusively established that no other individual ‚Äì not even Kelley‚Äôs own parents or partners ‚Äì knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,‚Äù Rodriguez wrote. Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child‚Äôs skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers and from possessing body armor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hospital leaders renewed their pleas for people to get vaccinated Wednesday as the state experiences another surge in new coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant. That strain has begun to surge in Utah over the past month and now represents about 80% of cases in the state, said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the state health department. Utah has averaged about 386 confirmed cases per day over the past week, nearly double the case rate the state was experiencing at its lowest point in early June. The surge is largely occurring in unvaccinated people who are being infected and hospitalized at six times the rate of vaccinated people, Hoffman said. ‚ÄúThe frustrating part about all of this is that, unlike last year, we have all the tools to stop this pandemic in its tracks,‚Äù Hoffman told reporters during a virtual briefing. ‚ÄúThe COVID-19 vaccines work.‚Äù Utah now ranks fourth in the nation for new cases per capita, and the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 31% over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Utah met health officials‚Äô goal of vaccinating 70% of adults and 25% of children ages 12 to 15 with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, but hospital leaders say more people need to be vaccinated to avoid hospitals from being overrun again.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The FIS Ski World Cup will be returning to the Killington Ski Resort this November. Over the years the event has drawn tens of thousands of people to the town on Thanksgiving weekend. It was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort & Pico Mountain, said in a news release that in addition to skiing, there will be a full weekend of activities, including live music. Joshua Eckler, owner of Trailside Inn, told the Rutland Herald he thinks this will be a big year for the World Cup, given the past 14 months of travel restrictions. ‚ÄúWe try to encourage a lot of guests to come for it even if they‚Äôre not ski racing fans because it‚Äôs more of an experience,‚Äù Eckler said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be a die-hard racing fan to enjoy the event, just because of the music and the atmosphere and the excitement ‚Äì everybody is screaming for everybody.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Workers removed a statue of Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former governor, U.S. senator and staunch segregationist, from the state‚Äôs Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal, and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state‚Äôs most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state‚Äôs racist ‚Äúmassive resistance‚Äù policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a years¬≠long movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state‚Äôs public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone‚Äôs throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd‚Äôs ‚Äúdevotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.‚Äù Byrd‚Äôs son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.\n\nWashington\n\nRichland: A new state report finds that more than 57% of Hanford Nuclear Reservation workers reported exposure to hazardous material on the former nuclear weapons production site in south-central Washington state. The Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board recently released its final report and recommendations on the unmet health care needs of Hanford workers. The report‚Äôs central recommendation calls for creation of a new, independent Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Center. It would provide a centralized clearinghouse for dissemination of accepted scientific literature. Important functions would also include evaluation and communication of newly available studies about Hanford-specific hazards. For incurable diseases such as chronic beryllium disease, information sharing could be key to finding cures. Additionally, the center would promote research to increase the body of knowledge for the Hanford workforce. Hanford for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, and thousands of workers are now tasked with cleaning up the nation‚Äôs largest volume of radioactive wastes. ‚ÄúThe working families that make up the Hanford community represent a very unique population, with occupational risks not easily quantified or identified,‚Äù said Nickolas A. Bumpaous, Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board co-chair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Traffic on the West Virginia Turnpike around the Fourth of July weekend was the heaviest since 2010. The turnpike saw 668,000 vehicles pass through its toll booths between Thursday and Monday, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release Tuesday. That‚Äôs 28% higher than for the five-day period a year ago, when travel was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. ‚ÄúIt was a huge Fourth of July period,‚Äù said West Virginia Parkways Authority executive director Jeff Miller. ‚ÄúPeople are just ready to get out and travel.‚Äù Miller said many travelers started trips the weekend before the Fourth of July and returned home the weekend after. Between June 27 and Monday, more than 1.12 million vehicles went through the turnpike‚Äôs toll booths, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: In a cheese-obsessed state that proudly touts itself as America‚Äôs Dairyland, the dairy cow is the official domestic animal, milk is the official state beverage, and cheese is the official dairy product. But even though Wisconsin produces more cheese than any other state at 3.4 billion pounds each year, there is no official state cheese. A bipartisan bill heard by a state Assembly committee on Wednesday would change that. The measure makes colby, which was created in Wisconsin more than 100 years ago, the official cheese. Colby may be as ‚Äúgouda‚Äù choice as any, but the choice threatens to turn fans of cheddar, swiss, provolone and other varieties red, or perhaps blue, in the face with rage. Colby also holds a special place in Wisconsin cheese history. It was created in the central Wisconsin city of Colby in 1885 by Joseph Steinwand, who named it after the township where his father built northern Clark County‚Äôs first cheese factory, according to a state historical marker in the city, located about 40 miles west of Wausau. Colby isn‚Äôt the most-produced cheese in Wisconsin. Mozzarella is tops, followed by cheddar and some Italian varieties, according to the USDA. Still, more than 45 million pounds of colby are produced at Wisconsin‚Äôs 150 cheese plants each year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state‚Äôs first female federal district judge plans to semi-retire in 2022, opening the way for Democratic President Joe Biden to nominate a judge in the deeply Republican state. Going on senior status will give U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal in Cheyenne more control over the number and type of cases she oversees. She plans to spend more of her free time with her husband, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, and grandchildren, Freudenthal told the Casper Star-Tribune. She hasn‚Äôt decided yet how she will use her time as judge but might stop taking new criminal cases to provide freedom from speedy trial requirements, she said. Freudenthal had no experience with criminal cases before becoming a federal district judge in 2010. She has found those cases the most rewarding because they can be life-changing for convicts, Freudenthal said. ‚ÄúYes, their lives going forward will still be very challenging, but they have the opportunity to rebuild that life, take advantage of resources, hopefully live a life of sobriety,‚Äù she said. Freudenthal, 67, holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. She was an attorney in the offices of Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan from 1980 to 1989.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/04/wwii-anniversary-liquor-boom-tracking-app-news-around-states/113659836/", "title": "WWII anniversary, liquor boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Halfway through the first quarter, the city‚Äôs public school system is preparing to reopen its doors to students for in-person instruction come October, with the plan to send families a survey in the next two weeks about their learning preference. The survey, focused on gauging how many families are interested in sending students back into classrooms, will be available Sept. 14-18. If students do return, the district will still offer virtual learning for those who are not comfortable with in-person instruction. Montgomery Public Schools is one of nearly two dozen districts across the state that chose to delay returning to school buildings for the first nine weeks of the year. MPS teachers have been working within the schools to conduct virtual lessons. A request to disclose whether any teachers have tested positive for COVID-19 or had to quarantine due to exposure since the start of the school year was not fulfilled by the district.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy‚Äôs decision to expand eligibility has prompted a rush of applications for small-business aid using federal coronavirus relief funds. The eligibility rule changes by the Republican governor prompted a wave of new applications Monday for the state-run program, KTOO reports. Under the previous rules, businesses were not eligible if they had received federal Paycheck Protection Program funds and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Dunleavy announced his administration was eliminating the restrictions Aug. 20. Businesses had applied for only $169 million of the $290 million budgeted for the program through Aug. 18. A total of $301.3 million had been requested after 812 businesses applied Monday for $55.6 million in expanded funding, said Julie Anderson, commissioner of the state Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Arizona State University has announced that some students living on campus will be moved ‚Äúto reduce the density in the dorms‚Äù because of an increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases. There are 5,000 spaces available in residence halls to begin shifting students housing arrangements, officials said. The announcement came after the university reported that 775 students and 28 faculty members tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday, shortly after in-person classes started Aug. 20. Among the students, 428 live off campus, 323 are in isolation at the Tempe campus, and the remainder are in isolation at either the Glendale or downtown Phoenix campuses. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one event or one location or one activity that is contributing to the spread,‚Äù the university said in a statement. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs just a couple of kids hanging out in a dorm room who take their masks off ‚Äì it‚Äôs a very contagious disease, and it‚Äôs spreading.‚Äù\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of active cases at the University of Arkansas‚Äô Fayetteville campus jumped Wednesday to nearly 400. The school reported 185 new cases at its campus between Sunday and Tuesday, bringing its total number of active cases to 399. ‚ÄúI realize that part of college life is the socialization that goes on, but in today‚Äôs environment it is important to keep in mind the social responsibility you bear to the entire society,‚Äù said Dr. Jose Romero, the state‚Äôs health secretary. ‚ÄúWithout your help, we cannot bring this pandemic under control.‚Äù UA has been conducting testing on its campus through Thursday, which Romero has said will give the state a better sense of how prevalent the outbreak is there. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he expected more than 1,000 test results from college students to come in over the next week.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: People experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County are testing positive for the coronavirus at rates far lower than among the population at large, a health official said Wednesday as he breathed a sigh of relief about the fate of the area‚Äôs most vulnerable residents. The percentage of homeless people who tested positive for COVID-19 was 1.87% as of Aug. 27, according to LA County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis. At least 1,589 cases of the coronavirus have been identified among the homeless population, with 41 deaths, he said. Los Angeles County‚Äôs overall positive rate is 10.2%, according to the Department of Health. Mel Tillekeratne, a leading Los Angeles homeless advocate, said he believes the reason for the lower rate may be that a majority ‚Äì about 70% ‚Äì of the county‚Äôs homeless live outside. In addition, LA‚Äôs homeless are increasingly conscientious about wearing masks to help prevent the spread of the virus, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A motorcycle rally plans to continue with its events scheduled for Labor Day weekend. Organizers for the Four Corners Motorcycle Rally say the three-day event will be scaled down due to coronavirus restrictions. Events have limited their capacity or been canceled altogether. The Hill Climb at Purgatory Resort and concerts at Sky Ute Casino Resort have been canceled. The Hooligan Dirt Dash, which typically draws about 1,500 people, will have a capacity of 100 people. John Oakes, an organizer, said the events will encourage social distancing and face coverings. ‚ÄúTypically, it was like a street party,‚Äù Oakes said. ‚ÄúBut now, it will be like a seated restaurant.‚Äù The rally had not received a permit from the city of Durango to hold the event as of Tuesday, the Durango Herald reports. But Alex Wilkinson, the community events administrator for Durango, said the event should receive the green light in time for Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont‚Äôs new choice to oversee the Connecticut Department of Correction said Wednesday that he believes the agency is better prepared for a possible new surge of coronavirus infections this fall than it was months ago, when the pandemic began and ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù were made. Angel Quiros, who will become the department‚Äôs first Hispanic commissioner, said prison officials have learned much more about the coronavirus since the spring. And some policies ‚Äì such as isolating inmates who tested positive at the state‚Äôs maximum-security prison and not allowing them to shower because of ventilation concerns ‚Äì have been changed. Quiros said the agency has been finishing a second round of mass testing, and the current infection rate is about 3%, compared to 9% earlier in the year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Latino‚Äå ‚Äåchildren‚Äå ‚Äåin‚Äå ‚Äåthe‚Äå ‚Äåstate‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äåhave been ‚Äåinfected‚Äå ‚Äåwith‚Äå ‚ÄåCOVID-19‚Äå ‚Äåat‚Äå ‚Äåa vastly ‚Äådisproportionate‚Äå ‚Äårate,‚Äå an‚Äå ‚Äåanalysis‚Äå ‚Äåof‚Äå ‚Äåstate‚Äå ‚Äådata‚Äå found.‚Äå ‚ÄåBetween April and June, about ‚Äå47‚Äå% ‚Äåto‚Äå ‚Äå60%‚Äå ‚Äåof‚Äå ‚Äåchildren‚Äå ‚Äådiagnosed‚Äå ‚Äåwith‚Äå ‚Äåthe illness ‚Äåwere‚Äå ‚ÄåLatino, according to state data. Latinos make up about 16% of the child population in Delaware. Latinos of all ages,‚Äå ‚Äåparticularly‚Äå ‚Äåthose‚Äå ‚Äåliving‚Äå ‚Äåin‚Äå ‚ÄåSussex‚Äå ‚ÄåCounty,‚Äå ‚Äåhave‚Äå ‚Äåthe‚Äå ‚Äåhighest‚Äå ‚Äårate‚Äå ‚Äåof‚Äå ‚Äåinfection‚Äå ‚Äåamong‚Äå ‚Äåany‚Äå ‚Äåracial‚Äå ‚Äågroup‚Äå ‚Äåin‚Äå ‚Äåthe‚Äå ‚Äåstate‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äì five times as high as white residents.‚Äå ‚ÄåThat led to state health officials significantly increasing testing in Latino communities. Doctors began knocking on doors, urging people to get tested. Community advocates helped find alternate housing for those who needed to quarantine and organized groceries for those who couldn‚Äôt leave their homes. In the past month, the state has seen a significant drop in the number of new positive cases among Latino children, but the rate is still disproportionate.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district has seen far fewer tourists compared to the pre-coronavirus era, WUSA-TV reports. According to data released by Destination D.C., before the pandemic, the city welcomed about 24.6 million visitors, with visitation up 4.1% in 2019. The tourism supported about 78,266 jobs in the city and brought $8.2 billion in visitor spending and $896 million in local tax revenue to the district. With 10 consecutive years of significant visitation growth in the city, Elliott L. Ferguson II, president and CEO of DDC, said he believes only about 11 million domestic visitors will travel to the city in 2020. That‚Äôs about 53% less than the previous year. Ferguson projected that if a vaccine is available as early as next year, and the economic impact of the pandemic doesn‚Äôt get worse, visitation could bounce back and climb to 20 million by 2022.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The highbrow Art Basel fair, known for glamorous parties and celebrity sightings, on Wednesday announced the cancellation of this year‚Äôs event amid the coronavirus pandemic. The prestigious December art fair draws collectors, socialites and celebrities from around the world to Miami. But the pandemic‚Äôs impact on international travel restrictions and other quarantine factors left little choice but to postpone the annual event until 2021, according to a statement from the organization. At the same time Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a new $13 million ad campaign to encourage Floridians to vacation in the state. The video ad encourages people to take advantage of the state‚Äôs golf courses, beaches, fishing and other outdoor activities. He made the announcement in Daytona Beach along with Visit Florida CEO and President Dana Young. DeSantis said it‚Äôs safe to visit theme parks and other Florida destinations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: With more than 3,000 public university students and employees across the state testing positive for COVID-19 since Aug. 1, some schools are taking action to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. Georgia Tech is encouraging students to convert to single rooms, moving out roommates over coming weeks to reduce exposure to the coronavirus. Both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia announced they are renting more off-campus rooms to isolate or quarantine students who have been infected or exposed to the virus. UGA reported 821 new infections for the week ended Saturday, a number that President Jere Morehead said Wednesday is ‚Äúconcerning.‚Äù He urged students to ‚Äúcontinue to make every effort to prioritize their health and safety by taking the proper steps to avoid exposure to this virus.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: When Japanese military leaders climbed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, the battleship was packed with U.S. sailors eager to see the end of World War II. On Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the surrender, some of those same men who served the United States weren‚Äôt able to return to the Missouri in Hawaii‚Äôs Pearl Harbor because of the world‚Äôs new war against the coronavirus. The commemoration initially was supposed to be a blockbuster event with parades, movie premieres, galas, and thousands of people honoring the veterans in their 90s or beyond, some who may be marking the milestone for the last time. Because of the threat of the virus, the ceremony was scaled down to about 50 people, with local veterans and government officials gathering on the USS Missouri in masks. The names were read of surviving WWII veterans, including 14 who were on the ship the day the Japanese surrendered.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will remain in the fourth and final stage of reopening during the coronavirus pandemic for at least another two weeks, Gov. Brad Little said Thursday. Little said hospitalizations of those infected remain too high, but other areas, such as the positivity rate, are improving. He also encouraged getting flu shots, saying that flu patients combined with COVID-19 patients could threaten health care capacity. A shortage of medical supplies or patient beds could cause the state to fall back to more restrictions. ‚ÄúThese variables threaten our health care capacity ‚Äì the very thing we are trying to protect so that our economic rebound can continue,‚Äù Little said. Johns Hopkins University data through Wednesday shows Idaho has seen a total of more than 32,000 coronavirus infections and 372 deaths.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is ramping up enforcement of restrictions on student activity after more than 330 COVID-19 cases in two days on the school‚Äôs Urbana-Champaign campus, school officials said Wednesday. In an email to students, Chancellor Robert Jones said he expects all undergraduates to ‚Äúlimit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities‚Äù for the next two weeks. ‚ÄúThese include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention,‚Äù Jones wrote. Meanwhile, Illinois State University in Normal is reporting about 1,025 students have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the fall semester two weeks ago, nearly 5% of the student body.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning Hoosiers to take coronavirus precautions seriously over the Labor Day weekend even as new statewide COVID-19 risk ratings show most counties with minimal or moderate virus spread. The new county-by-county map available on the Indiana State Department of Health‚Äôs website Thursday gives a red rating of high spread to only Martin County in rural southwestern Indiana. Seven other counties, including South Bend‚Äôs St. Joseph County, Muncie‚Äôs Delaware County and Terre Haute‚Äôs Vigo County, have orange ratings of moderate to high spread. The remaining 88 counties received yellow or blue ratings based on the number of new cases per 100,000 residents and the percentage of tests confirming COVID-19 infections. The map is meant as a guide for school leaders on whether to keep students in classrooms.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: As the state sees some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the nation, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday that she will wait to determine whether her move to close bars in six counties slows the virus‚Äôs spread before considering additional steps. Reynolds said the soaring number of confirmed virus cases is largely due to infections among young people, especially those in the college towns of Iowa City and Ames. Reynolds said she would make $10,000 grants available to the bars, taverns breweries, wineries and other businesses that sell alcohol in those counties to help them get through another shutdown. She also said she supported Iowa State‚Äôs decision to allow 25,000 fans into a Sept. 12 football game, even as Ames sees some of the country‚Äôs highest rates of coronavirus infections. However, Iowa State announced a short time later that it had changed its plans and wouldn‚Äôt allow fans to attend. The game will be televised.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Amid intense pressure, the state‚Äôs largest school district has overturned its decision to call off all fall sports and activities because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Board of Education for the 50,000-student Wichita district reversed itself Tuesday after members were flooded with emails and phone calls pleading and demanding that sports be allowed to continue. The outcry included a massive demonstration at Wichita Northwest High School. Athletes also had stood outside the board‚Äôs meeting space holding signs and chanting following the initial Aug. 20 cancellation decision, The Wichita Eagle reports. District schools will only compete against each other during the regular season but would remain eligible for postseason play. Some of the state‚Äôs other large districts have called off fall sports, including Shawnee Mission and Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signaled Wednesday that he expects to extend his mask mandate again later this month, saying the facial covering requirement is ‚Äúmore important than ever‚Äù amid efforts to reopen schools and protect the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For a second straight day, the governor reported more than 800 new coronavirus cases in Kentucky. He said statewide cases appear to be ‚Äúcreeping up, and we need to watch it.‚Äù He later said the state is in ‚Äúa dangerous place‚Äù in battling the outbreak. The state is approaching a total of 50,000 cases and nearing 1,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Beshear reported 18 more virus-related deaths Wednesday, raising the death toll to 36 in the past three days. Despite the high number of cases, the Democratic governor insisted his requirement that people wear masks in public is working and indicated the order will be extended again later in the month.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards is asking a federal judge to order the state‚Äôs elections chief to broaden the use of absentee-by-mail voting for the fall elections because of the pandemic. The Democratic governor filed the request with the court Wednesday in an ongoing lawsuit by voting rights advocates seeking to widen mail-in balloting options for the Nov. 3 presidential and congressional election and a Dec. 5 state runoff. ‚ÄúThe governor asks this court to protect the right to vote ‚Äì and just as importantly, the health and safety of the people of Louisiana ‚Äì by ordering the implementation of an election plan that sensibly addresses the current pandemic and safeguards constitutional rights,‚Äù wrote Edwards executive counsel Matthew Block. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the Republican who manages Louisiana‚Äôs elections, has proposed a limited expansion of absentee-by-mail voting for those who are confirmed to have COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday extended a state of emergency for a sixth time during the pandemic. In a statement, Mills urged Mainers not to let ‚Äúpandemic fatigue‚Äù allow them to become complacent, especially as students are returning to schools and universities across the state. ‚ÄúThe outbreaks which we hear about in other states every day can sometimes feel far away from the relative safety of our state, but recent events prove that one little match can spark a fire that may be very difficult to put out,‚Äù she said, referring to outbreaks associated with a recent wedding in the Katahdin region. A state of civil emergency allows Maine to draw down critical federal resources and to deploy all available tools to contain COVID-19. Such orders are issued in 30-day increments.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The mayor said Wednesday that the city won‚Äôt immediately follow some other parts of the state into the third phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. ‚ÄúWe do not want to erase the gains we‚Äôve made over the past month,‚Äù Mayor Bernard C. ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Young said at a news conference, local media outlets report. Young said he anticipates moving Baltimore into the second recovery phase next week, which would allow restaurants to expand their indoor dining capacity. He said additional details would be announced at a later time. Young‚Äôs announcement came a day after Gov. Larry Hogan announced all businesses in Maryland would be able to open later this week under Phase 3. But any local jurisdiction can decide not to open as much as the state plan allows.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Nearly 150 arts and cultural organizations are sharing in $815,000 worth of grants from the city‚Äôs Arts and Culture COVID-19 Fund, the city announced Thursday. The fund was established this summer with federal stimulus money to support small and midsized nonprofits to help them adapt their programs, spaces and operating models to comply with coronavirus regulations. ‚ÄúSupporting the organizations that bring transformative arts programming to every neighborhood in our city is imperative during this unprecedented time,‚Äù Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement. Boston‚Äôs arts and culture sector typically generates $1.35 billion in total economic activity, according to Americans for the Arts‚Äô Arts and Economic Prosperity 5 report, but has been hit hard by the pandemic. The Mass Cultural Council reported that cultural nonprofits in Massachusetts have lost $425 million in revenue with 17,000 jobs.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday in favor of the state order mandating coronavirus testing for all farmworkers in Michigan. The court‚Äôs decision was cheered by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and immigrant advocates who say the order protects farmworkers, most of whom are Latino immigrants. In a 3-0 ruling, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request by farm owners in Michigan for a preliminary injunction to block the state order issued Aug. 3. In a lawsuit filed after the order, a group of farm owners had maintained that the state order unfairly targeted farms and was discriminatory because the workers affected are mostly Latino. But in its ruling Wednesday, the federal appeals court said that blocking ‚Äúthe testing ... poses a substantial risk of harm to others given that identifying and isolating COVID-19-positive workers limits the spread of the virus.‚Äù\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota announced a plan this week for students to return to three of its campuses after the school‚Äôs decision to delay move-ins and in-person classes. According to the plan, sent via email to students, faculty and staff from University President Joan Gabel, students will be able to move into dormitories Sept. 9 at the Duluth campus, Sept. 15 at the Twin Cities campus and Sept. 18 at the Rochester campus. The plan comes after a decision last week by the university‚Äôs Board of Regents to delay residence hall move-ins and the start of most in-person classes at the three campuses for two weeks. The plan outlines four steps that become increasingly less restrictive over time, including limiting on-campus activities and movement, limiting access to campus facilities, and lifting curfews in later steps. All four steps emphasize students wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Gov. Tate Reeves on Wednesday defended his practice of referring to the new coronavirus as the ‚ÄúChina virus.‚Äù Reeves has used the phrase several times, including in social media posts. Reeves supports President Donald Trump, who has also used the phrase. During a news conference Wednesday, Reeves was asked about his use of the phrase, including whether such language could be used to bully people of Asian descent. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt condone anyone bullying them,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt condone mask bullying, either.‚Äù Reeves added: ‚ÄúHad this virus not escaped from ‚Äì however it occurred ‚Äì from the lab in China, I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôd be having the kind of conversations that we‚Äôre having all day, every day. And that‚Äôs just a fact.‚Äù Trump and some of his advisers have repeated the unsubstantiated theory about the virus originating in a virology lab in China.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: More than four months after state Attorney General Eric Schmitt sought to hold China and the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic, the lawsuit remains stalled in federal court. Neither the Chinese government, the Communist Party nor the officials named in the lawsuit have filed a response, KCUR-FM reports. Missouri served the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing with summonses July 17. Under U.S. law, a foreign state or agency has 60 days to respond after being served. That means the defendants‚Äô deadline to respond could be as soon as late September. But because U.S. law generally grants foreign states immunity, most legal experts agree the case isn‚Äôt likely to go anywhere even if the defendants do respond. Chris Nuelle, a spokesman for Schmitt, declined to say what steps the attorney general‚Äôs office would take if China simply ignores the lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday announced a new loan program to spur economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus, as applications for unemployment assistance increased in Montana for the third consecutive week. Nearly 2,400 residents submitted new applications during the week ending Aug. 29, an increase of 3% from the previous week, according to figures from the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. Since mid-March, the state has processed more than 141,000 new claims. Nearly one-third of the state‚Äôs workforce has been unemployed at some point during the pandemic. The Montana Working Capital program will provide loans of up to $500,000 to businesses affected by the virus. It will utilize funds that were originally allocated to a loan deferment program, which allowed Montana businesses to defer payments on existing loans.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has quarantined four of its sports teams after some athletes tested positive for the coronavirus, and data shows the state approaching 400 COVID-19 deaths. UNO shut down workouts this week and quarantined members of its men‚Äôs basketball, women‚Äôs softball, men‚Äôs baseball and women‚Äôs volleyball teams, the Omaha World-Herald reports. That came after the results of 13 UNO athletes who were tested Friday came back positive for the virus. None of the UNO athletes who tested positive has shown any symptoms, UNO Chancellor Jeffrey Gold said Wednesday. The state‚Äôs online tracker shows that as of Thursday, nearly 35,000 people have tested positive for the virus, and 399 have died from it. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has risen over the past two weeks from 256.43 new cases per day Aug. 19 to 318 new cases per day Sept. 2.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state coronavirus contact-tracing application called ‚ÄúCOVID Trace‚Äù launched last week should work well with a similar tool that Google and Apple are rolling out to alert people who might have been exposed to COVID-19, officials said Wednesday. ‚ÄúThey actually run in parallel and complementary,‚Äù Julia Peek, deputy Nevada health administrator, said after reporting 20,000 downloads since the state app debuted Aug. 24 for Apple and Android phones. The free app is designed to let phones anonymously and automatically exchange data by Bluetooth and notify a phone user if they‚Äôve been near someone who tested positive for COVID-19, if that person has granted permission and added their phone ID to a database of positive cases. Peek told reporters that widening the notification net should also help reach visitors to Nevada from states that don‚Äôt have similar COVID-19 tracing technology.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State public health officials provided new guidance this week on when schools should switch teaching models based on community transmission of the coronavirus and its impact on individual schools. The guidance sets out criteria for rating the level of community transmission in a county or city as either minimal, moderate or substantial based on the percentage of positive tests, infections per capita in the previous two weeks and the number of new hospitalizations per capita during that time period. School districts also are advised to rate their level of school impact as low, medium or high based on the transmission within the facility, student absenteeism and staff capacity to conduct classes. Using those two levels, districts can consult a matrix that recommends an appropriate teaching model.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: The federal government has fined a state-run veterans‚Äô home in the city more than $21,000 for mixing up the identity of a veteran who died from COVID-19 during the chaos of the pandemic in April and for shortcomings in infection control. Eighty-one residents of the New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home and a nurse‚Äôs aide have died from complications of coronavirus, and four residents are currently hospitalized, according to the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which operates the home. The death toll is among the highest in the nation at any long-term-care facility. Two local congressmen have called for the home‚Äôs CEO, Matthew Schottlander, to resign, and one of the largest state veterans organizations, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, has asked for a criminal investigation into the deaths at Paramus and another state-run veterans‚Äô home in Menlo Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A top state health official warned Wednesday that COVID-19 infections are far more prevalent in low-income areas of the New Mexico, potentially straining Medicaid health care. Human Services Secretary David Scrase said an analysis of infection rates by census tract shows that highly impoverished areas have infection rates seven times higher than the most affluent zones. ‚ÄúThis means Medicaid is going to see way more than its proportionate share of cases in the course of the pandemic,‚Äù he said. About 38% of New Mexico residents are enrolled in federally subsidized Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program for people living in poverty or on the cusp. Health officials are concerned that socializing over the Labor Day holiday weekend could lead to renewed surges in COVID-19 infections ‚Äì citing the aftermath of Memorial Day and Independence Day holidays.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he won‚Äôt let New York City reopen its restaurants for indoor dining until it comes up with a plan to make sure they are following regulations to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. The governor said he thinks restaurants should open in New York City, but the state doesn‚Äôt have enough personnel to monitor the city‚Äôs 27,000-plus eateries. ‚ÄúThese institutions are under dire economic circumstances,‚Äù Cuomo said Thursday. ‚ÄúAnd we know that compliance has to happen.‚Äù Cuomo is facing pressure from the restaurant industry, which has seen business plummet amid the pandemic and hundreds of workers seeking unemployment assistance. More than 300 restaurant owners who want to reopen have sued New York City and the state, seeking more than $2 billion, over the continued ban on indoor dining.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Legislature finalized a plan Thursday to spend $1.1 billion of the state‚Äôs remaining COVID-19 relief funds from Washington, including direct cash payments to nearly 2 million families. The package ‚Äì which also provides a $50 uptick in weekly unemployment benefits and more funds for virus testing, tracing and personal protective equipment ‚Äì cleared its final legislative hurdle with a lopsided House vote. The measure, which cleared the Senate on Wednesday, now heads to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Although many of his spending recommendations were ignored by Republican legislative leaders, Cooper has not publicly criticized the measure and has shown no signs of vetoing it. Money is also being spent to expand rural broadband, help struggling small businesses and recruit poll workers on Election Day. Families with at least one child will receive $335 in stimulus-style payments by mid-December.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state set a near-record Thursday for the number of daily positive coronavirus tests and has increased its per-capita figures for the infection to the highest in the country. The state Health Department‚Äôs update showed that 360 of the 12,629 tests in the past day came back positive, with Cass, Grand Forks and Stark counties each reporting 60 or more positive cases. Of the 32 counties with positive tests, Grand Forks County led the way with 79. The counties of Burleigh and Morton, which have been monitored in recent weeks by a special task force, combined for 43 new cases. North Dakota recorded of high of 373 positive tests statewide Aug. 28. It now ranks first in the country in the number of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Student coronavirus cases at Ohio State University jumped by nearly 400 since last week, according to data released by the university late Wednesday. Ohio State‚Äôs data dashboard showed 882 positive cases among students from Aug. 14 through Aug. 31. That‚Äôs about 3.13% of all students tested. Test results for Monday, the most recent 24-hour testing period for which data was available, showed higher positivity rates. Among on-campus students, 5.7% tested positive Monday. The same day, about 9.66% of students living off campus tested positive. In an email to the campus community, President Kristina M. Johnson said the 5.7% positivity rate among on-campus students Monday was a slight decrease from the 5.86% rate last Thursday, showing that students who were wearing masks and keeping distance were having an impact, she said. The 9.66% off-campus rate Monday ‚Äúis not as encouraging,‚Äù she said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state reported 909 newly confirmed coronavirus cases Thursday and 14 more deaths due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported 61,027 cases and 835 deaths, up from 60,118 confirmed cases and 821 deaths Wednesday. The actual number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The White House Coronavirus Task Force continues to recommend a statewide mask mandate, which Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he will not issue. The task force‚Äôs Aug. 30 report, released Wednesday by the health department, also calls for closing bars and limiting the number of people allowed inside restaurants. The department reported 8,745 active virus cases and said 51,447 people have recovered.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The rate of positive coronavirus tests in the state dropped to 4.4%, the lowest it has been in two months, officials from Oregon‚Äôs health authority said Wednesday. The weekly amount of cases also continued to decline, decreasing 8.6% from the previous week. The Oregon Health Authority reported three new COVID-19-related deaths and 140 new confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases Wednesday, bringing the state total to 27,075. The state‚Äôs death toll is 468. The age group with the highest incidence of reported infection remains 20 to 29 years old. On Tuesday, Gov. Kate Brown announced she was extending her declaration of state of emergency for an additional 60 days ahead of Labor Day weekend. She also urged Oregonians to continue to follow coronavirus safety regulations during the holiday weekend, warning that celebrations could ‚Äúsow the seeds of COVID-19 outbreaks‚Äù and ‚Äúset us back for months.‚Äù\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Temple University announced Thursday that the majority of classes will shift online through the end of the fall semester amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases among students. In a statement attributed to the university‚Äôs president and provost, the university said it had tried in-person classes because students had overwhelmingly expressed a preference to come back to campus. But after talking to officials at the city Health Department, the university‚Äôs leadership decided to shift about 95% of classes online. Students living on campus can opt to leave by Sept. 13, and the university will refund charges for housing and meal plans. But officials said students will be allowed to stay, and services such as health services will remain in place. The cases at Temple have been the cause of a recent uptick in cases recorded in Philadelphia. The city has worked with the university‚Äôs health services department to conduct contact tracing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Three employees of the contractor that runs a state campground are temporarily off the job after one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement Wednesday from the Department of Environmental Management. The employee who tested positive is part of a team that cleans restrooms at Burlingame State Campground in Charlestown. Because restrooms are closed while being cleaned, the staff has little interaction with public. The workers also wear gloves and masks. The worker, who learned of the positive test result Monday, worked four days while symptomatic, last working Sunday, the department said. The employee‚Äôs co-workers were tested Tuesday and will remain out of work until results come back. The state‚Äôs campgrounds reopened June 30 at limited capacity. At Burlingame, the state‚Äôs largest campground, the state reduced capacity by 15%.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate agreed Wednesday to allow all voters to cast absentee ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic but rejected a proposal by Democrats to allow ballots to be placed in drop boxes. Instead, absentee ballots will still have to be mailed in or dropped off in person at voting offices in each county if the bill is approved by the House and signed by the governor. The bill passed unanimously, but the drop box proposal and others, such as allowing early voting, were rejected by 24-16 or 25-16 votes on party lines, with Democrats on the losing side. Republicans spent only a few minutes arguing for their proposed changes during Wednesday‚Äôs session. Most settled on making small, careful changes that they said balanced safe voting with preventing fraud. Democrats said Republicans were risking the health of people in a state where almost 2,650 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has been named the worst in the nation for COVID-19 after a surge in cases in the past week. The state reported 2,152 cases in the past seven days, or 243 cases per 100,000 people. That‚Äôs the highest amount of cases per 100 in the nation, according to tracking done by The New York Times. By the Times‚Äô count, Iowa is second and North Dakota third. The worst of the spread in South Dakota is in Clay County, home of Vermillion and the University of South Dakota, which has reported 205 cases in the past seven days. That‚Äôs 1,457 cases per 100,000 people, according to the Times, and puts Clay as the seventh-worst county in the nation. Other South Dakota counties that are seeing a surge: Potter (650 per 100,000), Gregory (526), Meade (487), Codington (486), Brookings (470) and Fall River (432).\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are bracing for the likelihood they will see more violations of Metro‚Äôs public health orders, particularly as they look to expand what residents and businesses are allowed to do during the coronavirus pandemic. But the city is running out of people to enforce those rules. So Mayor John Cooper wants the ability to deputize additional city workers to help. The burden of the city‚Äôs mask mandate and other orders has stretched the capacity of the Metro Health Department, already tasked with testing, contact tracing and enforcing existing health regulations. Nashville council members will consider two pieces of legislation for final approval Sept. 15 that would broaden enforcement ability in certain Metro departments that already have permitting power and would extend citation authority to any city employee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday stopped, for now, a plan to send more than 2 million mail-in ballot applications to registered Houston-area voters before the November election. The temporary stay comes after GOP activists sued Harris County elections officials over intentions to send a mail ballot application to all registered voters in the state‚Äôs most populous county, regardless of whether they‚Äôre eligible to vote by mail. Texas generally limits mail voting to citizens with disabilities or those 65 or older and is one of the few states not allowing more people to vote by mail this year over COVID-19 fears. Texas‚Äô GOP leaders have resisted calls to expand mail balloting, keeping them aligned with President Donald Trump who has claimed that making it more widespread could increase election fraud and uncertainty. There is no evidence of widespread fraud through mail-in voting.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: An organization calling itself Utahns for Medical Freedom has filed a referendum to repeal a citywide mandate that would require people to wear facial coverings indoors and outdoors in public areas and at large gatherings during the pandemic. The group filed the referendum Tuesday, KSTU-TV reports. Mayor Michele Kaufusi previously vetoed the ordinance, but the Provo City Council overrode the veto last Thursday. City Recorder Amanda Ercanbrack said the referendum will not appear on this year‚Äôs ballot because the deadline has already passed. Utahns for Medical Freedom must now collect 3,200 signatures to qualify for the November 2021 ballot. Ercanbrack said the city would not implement a stay on the mandate until the petition has received enough signatures. The ordinance is currently in effect and set to expire Nov. 15.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Coronavirus testing clinics are being held in the city over three days as the state responds to an outbreak traced to a lodge. The Wednesday-through-Friday testing at the Rutland Regional Medical Center is in addition to the Vermont Health Department‚Äôs pop-up clinic that was held Wednesday at the Asa Bloomer state office building. Health officials are responding to an outbreak of at least 14 cases traced to people who attended or close contacts of people who attended a private party held Aug. 19 party at the Summit Lodge at Killington. Vermont officials say the lodge followed all the protocols, and officials have helped with the state investigation. In a statement, the Summit Lodge said no members of its staff are exhibiting symptoms of the disease, but two people will be tested as a precautionary measure.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority brought in $1.2 billion in revenue during the 2020 fiscal year in a nearly $120 million increase from the previous year, even as the coronavirus pandemic left restaurants and bars shuttered for months. It‚Äôs the second year in a row the liquor agency surpassed $1 billion in gross revenue, which was bolstered by retail sales with the switch to online ordering, curbside pickup and shipping amid the pandemic, the authority announced Wednesday. But the figures revealed the pandemic‚Äôs negative effects on licensed establishments such as restaurants and bars. The authority loosened restrictions to allow for delivery and takeout of alcoholic beverages and expanded patio access, but sales still dropped by 19% as retail sales increased by 18%, news outlets report, citing the data.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State officials are providing nearly $100 million in rental assistance as a part of the federal coronavirus relief bill. The state Department of Commerce said its program focuses on preventing evictions by paying up to three months of rent to landlords of eligible participants. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed off on the funding, which passes the state money through county governments. The county then contracts organizations that have a history of providing rental assistance, said Ted Kelleher, the managing director of the Housing Assistance Unit at the Department of Commerce. ‚ÄúI get calls, at least one an hour, from a person who is in a critical situation,‚Äù Kelleher said. ‚ÄúEveryone is working as fast as they can, faster than it‚Äôs ever happened before. He told KING-TV that the $100 million in coronavirus aid bill funding will not be enough but is a good start.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Two days after bars around West Virginia University were allowed to reopen, Gov. Jim Justice shut them down indefinitely Wednesday, citing crowds of unmasked students and an increase in positive coronavirus cases. ‚ÄúPlease, kids, we have got to bear down here,‚Äù Justice said at a news conference. ‚ÄúYou are absolutely running the risk of killing somebody.‚Äù Photos circulating on social media showed lines of people without masks outside Morgantown bars as some businesses advertised ‚ÄúTaco Tuesday‚Äù specials. WVU started classes last week. In a letter Wednesday, WVU President Gordon Gee said students must make ‚Äúthe right choices‚Äù in order for the campus to remain open during the pandemic. On Thursday, the university reported its highest number of daily coronavirus cases among students for the second straight day with 48 confirmed cases out of 408 tests given, for a positive case rate of 11.8%.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Milwaukee County has seen a six-week decline in positive COVID-19 cases, signaling that measures taken by the county and the city could be helping slow the spread of the disease. ‚ÄúI definitely believe that the mask ordinance is helping,‚Äù retiring city Commissioner of Health Jeanette Kowalik said. ‚ÄúWhen you look at other communities across the country, you could see the rates were better than the ones that didn‚Äôt have them.‚Äù A downward trend in average new cases per day began around the same time the mandate went into effect. The seven-day average in Milwaukee was at one of its highest points July 11 and has continued to drop every week since then. The focus on enforcing the mask ordinance in Milwaukee has been on businesses, which Kowalik said seems to work better than citizen-based enforcement.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Public Defender‚Äôs office faces staffing losses that could severely affect its service to residents because of a 10% budget cut. State budget cuts eliminated about $3 million for the office that provides defense attorneys for court cases, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Public Defender Diane Lozano told the Legislature last year that her office was overburdened by heavy caseloads and struggled to retain attorneys. Lozano said in May that her office could no longer accept misdemeanor cases in Campbell County because of the overload and lack of attorneys for cases. When Lozano directed the Campbell County office to stop handling misdemeanors, 4.5 public defenders were handling the workload of 7.5 attorneys, a budget document said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/12/22/robotic-pets-washington-monument-senators-vaccinated-news-from-around-states/4002650001/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University‚Äôs nursing school is publishing a free book to tell the stories of some of its alumni and their work during the coronavirus pandemic. Titled ‚ÄúAuburn Nursing ‚Äì Living the Creed During the COVID-19 Pandemic,‚Äù the book includes stories of Auburn-educated nurses who worked both in their hometowns and places including New York to care for COVID-19 patients. The stories show the difficulty of working in an overwhelming situation, said nursing dean Gregg Newschwander. ‚ÄúAt Auburn, we often say, we make leaders,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn this book, you will see how true that is.‚Äù The university statement said the nursing school marked its 40th anniversary during the 2019-20 academic year, and stories began coming in about the work being done by Auburn alumni during the pandemic. The anniversary and those experiences were melded into print. Limited quantities of the book are available through the Auburn University Bookstore with online ordering. Though the books are free there is a shipping fee. Orders will be mailed after the university reopens following the holidays on Jan. 4.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage branch of a national nonprofit is racing to disperse the last of a $20 million grant meant for rent or mortgage assistance by Dec. 30 to avoid sending funds back to the federal government. United Way of Anchorage said it has about $7\n\nmillion left to dispense from the rent relief program, which began in June. Qualifying residents were initially granted at most $1,000 from the program, but they are now eligible to apply for three $1,000 checks. United Way has been actively calling people who previously applied for only one check to determine if they are still eligible for additional funds. The charity said it has been giving away several hundreds of thousands of dollars every day and has so far provided money to more than 6,000 people and families. ‚ÄúAny way we can find ways to get the most money out possible, that‚Äôs what we are doing,‚Äù United Way spokesman Jason Grenn said. Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson had said in November that the program‚Äôs funds would be depleted by the end of December, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:With more adults and children staying home because of federal and state guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19, many nonprofits have reported a rise in domestic violence and an increase in services to meet the demand. The Phoenix Police Department reported homicides involving domestic violence saw a 140% increase in the first half of this year. ‚ÄúWe can make the leap that it may be because of victims‚Äô limited access to leaving the home or obtaining resources since they are stuck at home in isolation with an abusive partner,‚Äù said Donna Bartos, founder of BLOOM365, an organization dedicated to preventing dating violence among teens and young adults in Peoria. New Life Center in Goodyear saw empty beds for the first time in years because of victims‚Äô inability to physically access resources. With support from The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com‚Äôs annual holiday giving campaign Season for Sharing, domestic violence shelters throughout the Phoenix area have offered additional services to domestic violence victims affected by COVID-19. Services offered include virtual counseling and support, as well as in-person support compliant with local and federal health standards. This year, Season for Sharing gave $175,000 to BLOOM365, New Life Shelter, Fresh Start Women‚Äôs Foundation, A New Leaf and other local nonprofits that serve adults and children affected by domestic violence. In March, Fresh Start pivoted to offering online services, including educational workshops and webinars, sessions with family lawyers and social workers, and small group meetings with staff members.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Democrats in the state Senate on Friday asked Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to close bars, limit the size of gatherings and extend protections for renters in response to the ongoing surge in coronavirus cases. Many of the proposals from the Senate Democratic Caucus echo recommendations previously made by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Democrats hold nine of the 35 seats in the majority GOP Senate, and will hold seven when the Legislature returns next year. ‚ÄúWhile individual actions and responsibility are needed to check the spread of this disease, the state can and should play a stronger role in protecting all Arkansans, both from the disease and its economic fallout,‚Äù the caucus said in a statement. The caucus called for closing bars and, in counties with high rates of new cases, limiting restaurants to takeout or outdoor dining. Democrats proposed paying employees of the establishments an additional $300 a week in unemployment benefits and providing additional support to the business owners. They also recommended the state extend a moratorium on evictions an additional six months. Hutchinson rejected the caucus‚Äô proposals.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom will quarantine for 10 days after one of his staffers tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a spokesperson for the governor‚Äôs office. The staffer tested positive Sunday afternoon, the spokesperson said. Newsom was then tested and his result came back negative. The staffer also had contact with other staff members, who were also tested. Their results came back negative. Newsom‚Äôs 10-day quarantine is out of ‚Äúan abundance of caution,‚Äù the statement said. The governor and other staffers were expected to be tested again in the next few days. Another person in the governor‚Äôs office tested positive in October, and the governor tested negative back then. Last month, members of the governor‚Äôs family were exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus. Newsom, his wife and four children tested negative at that time.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland:A temporary site for isolation, quarantine and recovery for people experiencing homelessness has opened in Loveland. The site, located at the Loveland Inn (5542 E. U.S. Highway 34), opened on Dec. 15 and is scheduled to operate for 60 days. The development comes amid a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases at area shelters that has created an urgent need for expanded facilities. The site has at least 85 rooms for those who need to isolate because they have tested positive for the coronavirus or are awaiting test results, along with those who need to quarantine because of an exposure. Initial priority will be given those who have tested positive or are showing symptoms. There are no onsite medical services. The site will take referrals from Larimer County Community Corrections in addition to serving unhoused individuals. A similar Fort Collins site located on Myrtle Street (which could only serve a maximum of 25 people) will close while the Loveland facility is operating and reopen once it closes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The University of Connecticut‚Äôs men‚Äôs basketball team has decided not to travel to Chicago to face DePaul on Wednesday. The school said Connecticut‚Äôs Department of Public Health has advised the program to refrain from competition against opposing teams if the opponent is still within the 14-day period from its last positive test results. No makeup date has been announced. The game is the sixth on UConn‚Äôs schedule that has been postponed or canceled because of COVID 19-related issues. DePaul announced Monday that a player had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:In the second quarter of this year, when the coronavirus pandemic first hit, 140 people fatally overdosed in Delaware ‚Äì up from 113 in the first quarter, according to state data shared at a recent Overdose System of Care meeting. At a recent news conference, state officials foreshadowed the worst prediction yet: a total that could surpass 500 overdose deaths by the end of the year ‚Äì a dramatic increase from last year (431). ‚ÄúWe know that the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult for all of us mentally and emotionally, but none more so than Delawareans struggling with addiction, mental illness or both,‚Äù said Molly Magarik, secretary of the state Department of Health and Social Services.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Washington Monument was set to reopen Monday after it was shuttered last week when a government official who led a private tour of the monument tested positive for the coronavirus, WUSA-TV reported. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt tested positive on Wednesday, shortly after conducting a private tour of the monument. Some National Park Service staff said they were near the secretary during his visit and are now in quarantine, causing a staffing shortage and temporary closure, Interior spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said. The news comes as D.C. took further steps to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the city on Friday, extending the District‚Äôs public health emergency and banning indoor dining. The Washington Monument was closed for six months earlier this year because of the pandemic. Since its reopening on Oct. 1, a comprehensive safety program has been implemented that includes timed ticketing, limited entries, physical distancing, and additional cleaning and safety measures to ensure the health and safety of visitors and employees.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach:Seniors in the general public will start getting the COVID-19 vaccine in Palm Beach County in January, the county health director said. The second vaccine made by Moderna is expected to ship out this week and the county is in line to get 18,000 doses, said Dr. Alina Alonso. Also this week, CVS and Walgreens will start visiting long-term care centers in the county to vaccinate senior residents. The first vaccine, made by Pfizer, shipped last week and went to five teaching hospitals in major metropolitan areas in Florida and to a state strike team that will vaccinate residents in nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Broward and Pinellas counties. Palm Beach County has been the stepsister waiting its turn. The wait ends this week and Alonso outlined an ambitious plan at a virtual town hall hosted by Rep. Lois Frankel on Thursday night. Firefighters, EMTs and other emergency management services personnel are expected to be vaccinated by the end of December or early January. Hospitals in the county will be getting the vaccine this week, as well. Alonso said she expects shipments of the vaccine to come every week and that there will not be a shortage.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Tanner Health System, with 3,500 employees, is bursting with COVID-19 patients. For weeks it has been operating at full capacity, with 55 patients needing admission Friday afternoon but waiting for beds. It has 61 COVID-19 patients being treated in units at its Carrollton, Villa Rica and Bremen hospitals. But the not-for-profit system so far has received no doses of the new COVID-19 vaccine to protect its staff. Maybe this week a shipment will come, Tanner Chief Operating Officer Greg Schulenburg said his contacts with the Georgia Department of Public Health have told the hospitals. Or it could be as late as the following week. They‚Äôre not sure. Why not sooner? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good question,‚Äù Schulenburg said. Nearby in Coweta County, the opposite situation prevails. In the same health district as Tanner, Cancer Treatment Centers of America‚Äôs hospital in Newnan said it had received every dose it needed to vaccinate all of its employees. The for-profit cancer hospital listed slightly more than 1,000 staff, including 148 administrators and support staff, in its latest filing with the state a year ago. Those kinds of disparities multiplied throughout Georgia last week as the first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were distributed. The issue for Tanner is not lack of preparation, Schulenburg said. The system has enough cold storage freezers required for the Pfizer vaccine to hold doses for all its employees, and they‚Äôre hoping to eventually ramp up enough to start treating health care personnel throughout West Georgia and East Alabama.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: About 3,300 families in Hawaii each received nearly 100 pounds of food during a charity event at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. The Great Aloha Run event on Friday raised about $385,000, with $185,000 raised privately and about $200,000 coming from federal coronavirus relief funds. The event occurred as Hawaii health facilities started to roll out vaccines in order to stem a coronavirus pandemic that has sparked widespread economic hardship and killed 281 people in the state as of Saturday. ‚ÄúIt was very heartwarming to see that the families were really, really happy,‚Äù said Carole Kai, the founder of the charity event, Enough food was available for 3,500 families, Kai said. The leftover food was scheduled to be given out on Saturday in Waianae. The food packages distributed included whole turkeys, hamburgers, spare ribs, eggs, vegetables and a variety of other items. Aloha Stadium announced Thursday it would stop scheduling new events at the stadium because of complications spurred from the virus and budgetary issues. Stadium officials will honor all prescheduled events and those that take place in its parking lot.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho government officials spent $162,500 at a women‚Äôs clothing store called Fantazia Apparel in Los Angeles last spring. Another $8,500 went to specialty beer maker Clairvoyant Brewing in Boise. A producer of theatrical effects fluids in Tennessee called Froggy‚Äôs Fog received $15,000. A public records request by the Associated Press showed just how far and wide the state ranged and what odd partnerships formed as officials scrambled to obtain personal protective equipment for medical workers as the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the U.S. Fantazia Apparel, which specializes in ‚Äúhigh quality tops for missy sizes,‚Äù obtained 50,000 hard-to-get N95 masks through its Chinese manufacturer and sold them to Idaho at a cost of $3.25 each. The N95 masks were designated as ‚Äúscarce materials‚Äù in March by the federal government. In all, Idaho buyers found more than 205,000 N95 masks, spending about $770,000, or about $3.75 each ‚Äì slightly more than the national average of about $3 that states were paying this spring, according to the AP‚Äôs data analysis. Before the pandemic, an N95 mask might have cost about 50 cents.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine here and across the world has been hailed as a monumental step forward in the fight to end a pandemic that has sickened millions and killed more than 300,000 across the country. But health care workers know its success depends upon the public‚Äôs willingness to receive the shots once a larger supply is available. So in the face of skepticism about a vaccine developed in record time, health care workers have become public-facing advocates for trusting the science. Television cameras, newspaper stories and social media livestreams and photos have accompanied vaccinations to build public trust. ‚ÄúI thought if people could relate to somebody that they knew, then maybe they would feel more comfortable about getting it themselves,‚Äù said Christa Anderson, a 34-year-old inpatient rehabilitation technician who has worked at OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center for 14 years. Anna Eich, a registered nurse who has worked for Mercyhealth for 14 years, also felt strongly about the need to share her experience. Eich is the nursing supervisor for the 52-bed medical-surgical unit at Javon Bea Hospital-Riverside, where at times about half the beds have been filled with COVID-19 patients. She was first in line to receive the vaccine last week at Mercyhealth‚Äôs Riverside campus and was recorded and interviewed by several news outlets about the experience.\n\nIndiana\n\nBluffton:A Wells County restaurant is suing Gov. Eric Holcomb and its county health department for coronavirus restrictions it said unconstitutionally and unfairly affect its business. Yergy‚Äôs State Road BBQ in a complaint filed last week in Wells County Circuit Court alleged Holcomb‚Äôs executive orders and the Wells County Health Department‚Äôs health policies ‚Äúare the product of arbitrary, unscientific value judgments.‚Äù The restaurant was shut down by health officials in August after staff at the restaurant reportedly refused to abide by state mask mandates. Yergy‚Äôs in the complaint said that decision to shut down was ‚Äúpredicated on unverified allegations‚Äù but went on to claim there is ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù Wells County would be at risk ‚Äúif healthy Yergy employees do not wear face coverings.‚Äù It also said the restrictions, which are in place to limit the spread of COVID-19, violate the business‚Äô ‚Äúcivil rights, liberty interests and property rights‚Äù and will result in a permanent closure of the establishment if not overturned.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Sunday at the recommendation of the Office of the Attending Physician. ‚ÄúI encourage all Iowans and Americans to do the same when their time comes. Thanks to #OperationWarpSpeed and the tireless work of Americans across the country, we are one step closer to defeating this virus,‚Äù Ernst wrote in a tweet. The legislative branch of federal government is rapidly moving to receive the vaccine, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell received the shot on Friday, according to the Associated Press. The Capitol physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, informed lawmakers Thursday night that they are all eligible for the shots under government continuity guidelines and asked members of the House and Senate to make appointments with his office to be vaccinated, according to the AP. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also important that we continue to wear a mask, social distance, and follow CDC guidelines to protect our families, friends and neighbors,‚Äù Ernst wrote in a tweet.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas prison officials said a 12th inmate with COVID-19 has died. The state Corrections Department said Saturday that a 62-year-old man who had been held at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility died Friday. He had been hospitalized with the virus since Nov. 23. Officials said he also had other health concerns that contributed to his condition. The inmate, who was not identified, had been serving a nearly 13-year sentence for aggravated indecent liberties with a child. He had been incarcerated since March 2013. Officials said this was the third COVID-19-related death at the Hutchinson prison. The Reno County Health Department reported 18 active cases of the virus at the prison, and 1,499 inmates have recovered from the virus.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:More relief in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Louisville in the back of two 18-wheelers Sunday morning as the first round of the new vaccines were shipped to the UPS Worldport shipping hub at Muhammad Ali International Airport just before 10 a.m., with a Kentucky State Police escort in tow. The first shots were expected to be administered across the U.S. on Monday. The first doses of the Moderna vaccine will go to hospitals across the state, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday at a press briefing. The first allocation will include 76,700 doses to be distributed, he said. Two truckloads filled with ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of boxes filled with doses (UPS could not say how many) stopped at the UPS Worldport early Sunday, and officials said a third could arrive later in the day. One delivery from the shipment will be taken to a location in Louisville, they added, and the others were set to be sent to other cities. Moderna‚Äôs vaccine is similar to the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, which was flown into Louisville last week to be shipped across the country and was made available to a number of local health care workers Dec. 14. That experience came in handy Sunday, as UPS spokesman Jim Mayer said handling practices for workers at the facility do not differ between the vaccines. There‚Äôs at least one key difference, though. The Moderna vaccine does not need to be kept at as low of a temperature as the Pfizer shot, which was shipped with dry ice at minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderna‚Äôs vaccine should, as a result, be easier to store and ship, though doses delivered Sunday were kept at minus-4 degrees.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:The Shreveport City Council voted 6-1 to approve a payment of $1,000 for every full-time employee and $500 for every part-time employee. Workers will get the money by Christmas, the Times of Shreveport reported. Council member James Flurry said the payment is hazard pay for workers during the coronavirus pandemic, not a bonus, taken from more than $2\n\nmillion in excess of sales tax revenue. City Council member John Nickelson said he voted against the move because the state constitution bars the city from paying a bonus to city employees. He also said the federal CARES Act barred bonsues other than hazard pay or overtime. The plan originally called for taking the money from federal coronavirus relief funds, but was amended to take the money from the city‚Äôs general fund. ‚ÄúI wish we could pay everybody more but we have to do it within constraints of our authority,‚Äù Nickelson told KTBS-TV. The city approved a permanent 4% raise for police and fire employees on Dec. 8\n\nMaine\n\nCamden: The pandemic has claimed another winter event in Maine ‚Äì the National Toboggan Championships. Organizers of the annual event announced this week that the championships have been postponed until 2022. Organizers had hoped to continue the event with a reduced number of participants, but they scrapped it because of a surge in COVID-19 cases in Maine, Co-Chairman Holly Anderson said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhile we are saddened that our event, like so many others in Maine, as well as the entire country, has been impacted by the pandemic, we know this tough decision is the right one,‚Äù she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story included an incorrect number of tool kits sent to U.S. teachers.\n\nSalisbury:A Parkside High School skilled trades teacher has been awarded tool kits to help students learning in a virtual format during the coronavirus pandemic. Automotive technology instructor David White was among 53 teachers in the U.S. who received a total of 3,500 tool kits from Harbor Freight Tools for Schools. The organization‚Äôs goal is to assist students who take classes relating to construction, welding, manufacturing, automotive and electric. The take-home tool kits will offer students more opportunities to fully benefit from the course despite the online learning platform. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre providing these tool kits because we believe that skilled trades jobs are essential to our country, now more than ever, and that means skilled trades education is essential, too,‚Äù said Danny Corwin, executive director of Harbor Freight Tools for Schools in a news release. Parkside, which is part of the Wicomico County Public Schools system, reverted back to virtual learning on Nov. 18 after an increase in the county‚Äôs COVID-19 positivity rate. Officials said they hope to return students to the classroom on Jan. 19.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts inmates will be some of the first to get coronavirus vaccines after health care workers, emergency medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities are vaccinated. Tens of thousands of inmates will be offered the shots ahead of home health aides, seniors and medically vulnerable residents, joining people who live in homeless shelters and other congregate settings who will be vaccinated by the end of February, The New York Times reported. ‚ÄúWe used equity as a core principle in our recommendations,‚Äù said Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious disease specialist and a member of the state‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine advisory group. ‚ÄúWe have had a lot of cases of COVID in the prisons, and we wanted to make sure those at highest risk were getting the vaccine first.‚Äù Prisons have had some of the country‚Äôs largest coronavirus outbreaks. More than 1 in 10 inmates across the country is over age 55 and more vulnerable to the virus, said Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, co-founder of the COVID Prison Project. Inmates also have higher rates of chronic medical conditions that increase the risk of severe illness if they become infected.\n\nMichigan\n\nHoughton Lake: A popular northern Michigan festival is switching to a February weekend because of coronavirus restrictions. Tip-Up Town USA in Houghton Lake promotes itself as Michigan‚Äôs longest-running winter festival, with a polar bear dip, snowmobile drag racing, ice fishing contest and more in Roscommon County. It began in 1950, according to the local Chamber of Commerce. The Jan. 16-17 dates have been switched to Feb. 27-28 because of restrictions on attendance at outdoor events, WWTV‚ÄìWWUP-TV reported. If there are conflicts with the new dates, Tip-Up Town probably will be canceled, organizers said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Pharmacy chain CVS Health said Monday it will begin vaccinating more than 63,000 long-term care residents and workers across Minnesota next week. CVS Health announced that it began vaccinating long-term care residents and staff in 12 states on Monday, and expects to begin administering the shot in 36 more states, including Minnesota, on Dec. 28. The pharmacy giant expects to vaccinate 4\n\nmillion residents and staff at 40,000 facilities across the country in 12 weeks. Minnesota began administering Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 shots to health care workers last week after the vaccine received emergency approval earlier this month. The state‚Äôs initial shipment last week contained 46,800 doses, and state health officials expect to receive more than 33,000 this week.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl: Mississippi‚Äôs top emergency manager has been hospitalized because of COVID-19 complications. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said in a statement Sunday that Director Greg Michel has been admitted to a hospital with pneumonia, a complication from his infection with COVID-19. Michel tested positive for the coronavirus on Dec. 9. Spokesperson Malary White said the agency continues to ‚Äúoperate as usual while taking every precaution necessary to protect our staff.‚Äù White described Michel as remaining ‚Äúin good spirits.‚Äù Michel was named to lead the agency by Gov. Phil Bryant in 2018 after then-director Lee Smithson resigned. Gov Tate Reeves, a Republican like Bryant, retained Michel. Michel is a retired colonel who commanded Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg from 2015 to 2017.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia:More than 1,500 coronavirus cases have been reported across Missouri‚Äôs Department of Mental Health offices and facilities since the start of September ‚Äì a figure that‚Äôs nearly five times larger than the previous six months combined. Those cases represent staff and patients in state-run mental health hospitals and department offices in roughly 20 communities throughout Missouri. The outbreaks have affected care, causing group therapy sessions to be temporarily suspended at some locations. And at least 11 patients have died, including seven deaths since mid-November. Four staff members have also died. Three of those patient deaths have been at the Southeast Missouri Mental Health Center in Farmington ‚Äì one of the state‚Äôs largest facilities and the one with the highest number of cases. Since March, 330 staff and 97 residents have contracted the virus ‚Äì with more than 250 cases reported in November alone.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: With social isolation now being encouraged and in some cases required to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Helena‚Äôs Area IV Agency On Aging is utilizing a new tool to help seniors fight loneliness: robotic pets. These uncanny creatures take the form of battery-powered dogs and cats, which stimulate the same parts of the brain as real-life pets. Jim Marks, program director for Helena‚Äôs Agency On Aging, said he discovered the potential of these robotic pets through research by the organization‚Äôs nationwide counterpart. ‚ÄúStudies show that older people latch onto them,‚Äù Marks told the Independent Record. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a feel-good, do-good kind of thing, but there is actual substance to it.‚Äù Margie Copenhaver, an 83-year-old resident of Eagle Manor in Helena, got her robotic pet, named Muffie, in early December. ‚ÄúMuffie is good company,‚Äù Copenhaver said. ‚ÄúMuffie talks to me and I talk to her. She is a cutie.‚Äù\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state said 582 people were being treated in hospitals for COVID-19 on Sunday, which was down from 598 the day before. That number has been steadily declining since setting a record of 987 on Nov. 20, but it remains more than 2.5 times higher than what it was on Oct. 1. Currently, 14% of the state‚Äôs hospital beds are occupied by coronavirus patients. If the seven-day rolling average of that figure remains below 15%, the state might further relax its social distancing restrictions. Nebraska reported 967 new virus cases and 11 new deaths Sunday to give the state a total of 156,382 cases and 1,486 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Deaths from the virus reached 111 in just the first couple of weeks of December in Washoe County, eclipsing the previous monthly record of 80 fatalities set during the month of November by 47.5%. Washoe and Nevada also saw their highest daily totals for COVID-19 fatalities last week. The death toll continues to increase even as the number of new cases saw a decline overall from the previous week. COVID-19 fatalities typically lag new cases by several weeks. Washoe County also started receiving its first batch of vaccines for the virus last week. New cases in Washoe for the seven-day period ending Dec. 17 numbered just a over 2,500, down from just over 3,000 reported during the previous week. The number of daily cases averaged about 359 a day.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manchester will be among hundreds of VA facilities nationwide that will begin receiving COVID-19 vaccines as soon as this week, according to U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H. Pappas, who serves on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, said Monday that the Manchester facility and more than 100 others will receive vaccines from the Department of Veterans Affairs. ‚ÄúIt is critically important that VA health care workers and veterans in long-term care units are able to receive the vaccine to keep themselves, their families and their communities safe,‚Äù Pappas said in a statement. Meanwhile, the state veterans home in Tilton continues to face an outbreak of the virus. As of Thursday, 92 residents and 98 staff had been infected, and 31 people had died.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday promised transparency over the state‚Äôs spending on protective gear bought to fight the coronavirus. Murphy, a Democrat, spoke during a news conference about the virus and responded to a reporter‚Äôs question about an Associated Press report showing New York and New Jersey have declined to release detailed breakdowns of their spending on personal protective gear and medical equipment during the first frenzied months of the virus outbreak. Murphy said he wasn‚Äôt sure why the purchase orders ‚Äì typically a public document ‚Äì were declined. ‚Äú√¨ have no problem at all reporting what we spent on PPE,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all for everyone knowing exactly what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù New Jersey did not provide purchase orders for personal protective equipment, saying fulfilling the request would be ‚Äúsubstantially disruptive to agency operations.‚Äù The state did provide a one-page document showing it spent $164\n\nmillion for 153\n\nmillion pieces of equipment, including masks, gloves, goggles, beds and even morgue trucks. It‚Äôs unknown when the documents will become available.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Health officials on Sunday reported 1,077 new COVID-19 cases and 16 related deaths. The statewide totals increased to 129,993 cases and 2,171 known deaths as seven-day rolling averages for daily new cases dropped and daily deaths rose over the last two weeks. Of the 1,077 new cases, New Mexico Department of Health officials said 278 were in Bernalillo County, the state‚Äôs largest county that includes the metro Albuquerque area. According to data from Johns Hopkins University and The COVID Tracking Project, the rolling average of daily new cases in New Mexico dropped from 1,869 on Dec. 4 to 1,542.1 on Friday and the rolling average of deaths rose from 28.9 to 34.1. On Thursday, when the state reported a pandemic-high 48 daily deaths linked to the pandemic, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she was concerned that daily deaths could grow even higher over the year-end holidays.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he has asked airlines flying into the state from the United Kingdom to make all passengers take a coronavirus test before they get on the plane. The Democrat said at least one airline, British Airways, had agreed to comply. He is awaiting an answer from others, including Delta and Virgin Atlantic, but was hopeful they would also agree. Cuomo has been calling on the U.S. government to temporarily halt all flights from the U.K. because of the emergence there of a new strain of the coronavirus. Numerous nations have taken that step out of concern that the newly identified strain might be more easily transmitted. ‚ÄúI think the United States should do what other countries have done, which is halt the travel,‚Äù Cuomo said, adding that too much was still unknown about whether the mutated virus would pose more of a threat. ‚ÄúI was on the phone with top experts all weekend. We don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs more deadly. We don‚Äôt know how much more easily it‚Äôs transmitted.‚Äù Cuomo added that he believed he had the legal authority as governor to ask airlines to test passengers in the absence of federal action.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFranklin: A sheriff‚Äôs office has been designated as a COVID-19 cluster after six members of the department staff tested positive, health officials said. The Macon County Health Department reported the tests results in a Facebook post on Friday, The Charlotte Observer reported. The health department said the sheriff‚Äôs office is aware of the exposure and are being contacted for testing. Clusters are defined as instances of five or more infections diagnosed within a 14-day period, all with what is termed as ‚Äúplausible linkage,‚Äù the department said. The health department said it is searching for additional close contacts to see how far the infections have spread. Anyone who came within 6 feet of an infected employee for 10 minutes or longer is at risk, officials said. The sheriff‚Äôs office shared the health department‚Äôs report on its Facebook page, but declined to comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: The impact of the coronavirus pandemic couldn‚Äôt be more evident than it is for Minot‚Äôs hotels. Business has plummeted. People haven‚Äôt been traveling. The Canadian border has been closed for months. Social distancing has put an end to events like banquets, wedding receptions and Christmas parties. Although hotels are certainly not the only businesses impacted by the pandemic, their empty parking lots and lobbies are vivid reminders of the ongoing economic effects of the pandemic. Many hotels have reduced overnight rates in the hopes of enticing more business but there are few people to attract. Airline travel has slowed immensely. In addition, with the cancellation of events big and small, there are fewer incentives to bring people to town. Minot is not alone. Fargo recently saw the cancellation of its 2020 Ice Fishing Show, a large event that was expected to draw hundreds of visitors to the city, and that is just one of many examples throughout the state and elsewhere. Among the losses so far in Minot this year were many major events ‚Äì including the State Fair and Hostfest. Canceled too were popular sporting events, flea markets, craft shows, gun shows, auction sales, wedding receptions and more.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The Ohio National Guard is preparing to assist with COVID-19 vaccinations. ‚ÄúThis weekend, we heard from the U.S. Department of Health and that allows them to help in the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine,‚Äù Gov. Mike DeWine said. DeWine said that he has not made any decisions on whether the National Guard will administer COVID-19 vaccines in Ohio. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to degrade the capacity of the medical field that is already strained,‚Äù said Major General John Harris. Ohio National Guard members working on the front lines of the COVID-19 response, some working in nursing homes and at food banks, will be given the vaccine.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The head of Oklahoma‚Äôs largest teachers union praised Gov. Kevin Stitt on Monday for moving school personnel to Phase 2 of the vaccine distribution plan, but she warned the governor that forcing schools to return to in-person learning next month could jeopardize the safety of public school workers. During a news conference, Oklahoma Education Association President Alicia Priest also released details of an informal survey of more than half its members that showed 63% believe schools are not safe for in-person instruction. The governor, who has pushed an aggressive reopening plan, has said his goal is to return all public schools to in-person classes after the Christmas break. Priest, a Spanish teacher from Yukon, described Stitt‚Äôs plan is an ‚Äúarbitrary date‚Äù and suggested it could pit parents and educators against one another. ‚ÄúAs someone with a daughter who is attending school, I identify with the frustration of parents,‚Äù Priest said. ‚ÄúBut we must remember that the enemy is the virus. It‚Äôs not educators and it‚Äôs not parents.‚Äù Priest also praised the State Board of Education for its recent decision to suspend for one year the state‚Äôs A-F grading system for public schools, a system the OEA opposed.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The first nursing home residents and staff in Oregon were set to begin receiving COVID-19 vaccinations Monday. Oregon had set aside about 10,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses from its first shipment for nursing homes. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that statewide, about half of the people killed during the pandemic have been older adults in congregate, or group, living settings. Last week, hospitals administered the first vaccines in the state Wednesday to nurses, respiratory therapists, housekeeping workers and other health care employees in high-risk jobs, marking the beginning of a broad vaccination campaign.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 17,000 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to health care workers at Pennsylvania hospitals, the state health secretary said Monday, as hospitals remain stressed by coronavirus patient loads and a second vaccine from Moderna is expected to arrive this week. Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said 87 hospitals have received doses of the first vaccine, from Pfizer, with another 30,000 doses set to arrive this week. In addition, hospitals in the state are set to start receiving 198,000 doses of the newly approved Moderna vaccine this week, Levine said. As part of a federal partnership, CVS and Walgreens next week will start on-site vaccination services for residents and staff of skilled nursing facilities across the state, Levine said. Those facilities will receive the Pfizer vaccine, she said. In the meantime, Levine said even people who are receiving the vaccine should continue to observe efforts to stem the spread of the virus, including wearing a mask and adhering to social-distancing protocols.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Some Rhode Island businesses are allowed to reopen or increase capacity Monday now that Gov. Gina Raimondo's ‚Äúpause‚Äù to help control the latest coronavirus surge has ended. The Democratic governor decided to lift the three-week pause because of what she called ‚Äúsustained decreases‚Äù in percent positivity rates which it is hoped will stop hospitals from being flooded with coronavirus patients. Businesses including gyms, casinos and indoor recreation facilities such as bowling alleys were allowed to reopen Monday, and restaurants are allowed to increase indoor capacity from 33% to 50%. ‚ÄúIt will be nice to finally open back up tomorrow and get some families back in here,‚Äù East Providence Lanes manager Michael Sedoma told WJAR-TV on Sunday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy not having income coming in. We had to layoff all of the employees right before Christmas.‚Äù\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFountain Inn:Days after playing Santa for special needs children, a South Carolina man tested positive for the coronavirus. About 11 families visited ‚ÄúSensory Santa‚Äù event on Dec. 13, and all were notified after the man‚Äôs test came back positive on Wednesday, Fountain Inn city administrator Shawn Bell told the Greenville News. The city said on its webpage that the man learned after the event that he had been exposed to the virus. Bell said the event was outdoors. A rope separated the children from Santa, who did not wear a mask, he said. ‚ÄúWe obviously regret that this has happened, but we were trying to do something nice for the community and especially for a segment of the community that often goes overlooked,‚Äù he said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Health officials said Monday an additional 20 people have died from COVID-19, bringing the total number of deaths in the state to 1,381. Health officials also reported 347 new cases of the coronavirus. Since the pandemic began, there have been more than 95,074 -19 infections in the state. As of Monday, 344 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in South Dakota, and of that number, 70 were receiving intensive care and 31 were on ventilators. According to the COVID Tracking Project, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in South Dakota has decreased over the past two weeks, going from 886.43 new cases per day on Dec. 5 to 561.29 new cases per day on Dec. 19.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey issued a strong warning that the state‚Äôs hospitals were reaching a breaking point and staffing was becoming increasingly more difficult. She pleaded with the public not to gather with others outside of their immediate households. ‚ÄúIf we have another surge after Christmas and New Year‚Äôs like we did after Thanksgiving, it will completely break our hospitals,‚Äù Piercey told reporters.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Capitol will reopen to the public in January after being closed for much of the year because of the coronavirus pandemic, a decision that comes as new cases and hospitalizations are surging to the highest levels since the summer. The capitol will reopen Jan. 4 ‚Äì roughly a week before the Legislature reconvenes for the first time since 2019. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the reopening Monday in a statement that noted how other state capitols remain closed. Abbott said health and safety protocols will be put in place for the Capitol‚Äôs reopening. More than 26,000 front-line and other essential workers in Texas as of Monday had received the first vaccinations that began arriving this month, according to state health officials. Abbott has said more than 1\n\nmillion doses of the vaccine will have been distributed in Texas by the end of the month.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Municipalities in Washington County have less than two weeks to spend the remainder of the more than $30.7 million in federal coronavirus relief money available before the end of the year. Sixteen local governments, including the county government, were allocated a slice of funding from the CARES Act, a bipartisan relief bill that, among other things, pumped $150\n\nbillion in direct aid to state, local and tribal governments to help fight the pandemic. That money must be spent by Dec. 30 or it goes back to the federal government. With that deadline fast approaching, almost all of Washington County‚Äôs local governments have told the state they intend to spend all of their federal aid funding by the end of the year. The town of Leeds was the only municipality in Washington County to say it didn‚Äôt plan to exhaust all of its funding by the deadline. Leeds sent an unused balance of $36,971.92 back to the state, a little less than half of the $75,721 in CARES funding the town was allocated. Duncan Evans, budget manager at the Governor‚Äôs Office of Management and Budget, said Leeds is among just a handful of municipalities statewide that sent money back. In total, the agency collected about $1\n\nmillion in unused aid funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Public schools in Vermont‚Äôs largest city have switched to remote learning this week ahead of the holiday break. Burlington School District Superintendent Tom Flanagan said in a note to the community that ‚Äúthe increased demands of contact tracing and the number of staff who have been asked to quarantine through this process have strained our system.‚Äù He also noted that student attendance is also lower than usual. The goal is still to return to in-person learning starting on Jan. 4, Flanagan said. He urged students and staff not to travel out of state or gather with other households, wear masks, stay 6 feet apart from others when possible, and get tested if they think they have been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A report from Old Dominion University said it will likely take years for the state to achieve a complete economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The project comes from the 2020 State of the Commonwealth Report from ODU's Strome College of Business. The report, released Sunday, said the pandemic ended a record of 11 straight quarters of economic growth and wiped out nearly a decade of job gains. The state had added a half-million jobs between February 2010 and February of 2020. But by April 2020, about 438,000 jobs in Virginia were temporarily furloughed or permanently laid off. And although Virginia has recovered about 200,000 jobs since then, there has been slowing job growth.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal judge has declined to order speedier bail hearings for detainees at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in Tacoma who are especially at risk from COVID-19, despite recent cases there. Attorneys for the detainees asked U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle to order the expedited bail hearings, to put a cap on the detention center‚Äôs population, and to order periodic testing of detainees and staff. In an order Friday night, the judge declined. Robart, who also declined to order the release of at-risk immigration detainees early in the pandemic, said he could not conclude that the detention center‚Äôs COVID-19 precautions have been unreasonable. ‚ÄúWhile there have been a limited number of individuals to test positive for the virus, Respondents continue to implement practices to abate the risk of an outbreak,‚Äù the judge wrote. ICE has released or deported dozens of at-risk detainees, and the judge noted that the 1,575-bed facility now has just 290 detainees. The jail is run by the GEO Group, a for-profit company. Guards are required to wear masks, though detainees insist that compliance has been spotty; newly arrived detainees are quarantined for two weeks; detainees who test positive are isolated; and temperature checks are performed regularly, the judge said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state‚Äôs two U.S. senators said they have received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccinations. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito tweeted a photo Friday of her vaccination. She said the shot was ‚Äúquick, painless, and most importantly, it was safe.‚Äù She tweeted Saturday that her arm is a little tender, similar to after a flu shot, but otherwise, she is experiencing no problems. In a news release, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said he received the shot on Saturday morning and is feeling well. He also tweeted footage of his vaccination, saying, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel a thing! This vaccine is safe & effective.‚Äù Both said they had the vaccination in accordance with guidance from the Capitol‚Äôs Office of the Attending Physician. The vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech requires two doses several weeks apart from the same company as the first shot.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A top official said University of Wisconsin System students will be allowed to return to campus for the spring semester and take more in-person courses, hoping that more robust COVID-19 testing will help stave off the types of outbreaks that forced the system to turn to online-only instruction a few weeks into the fall semester. Andrew Petersen, the president of the Board of Regents, said he expected students to be able to return to their schools and live in residence halls safely. The system plans to test students living in dorms for the disease at least once a week. Students living off-campus and faculty and staff will be tested at least once every two weeks. UW-Madison, the system‚Äôs flagship school, will test all students twice a week. Regents want to see more in-person classes than schools offered in the fall, saying such instruction is far preferable to online learning or a hybrid model, he said. Chancellors will work with faculty to determine how best to implement in-person instruction, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: On Sunday, 164 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in the Wyoming Department of Health‚Äôs daily update, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Counties with the most cases were Sweetwater (37), Laramie (34) and Uinta (18). There are now 35,982 confirmed cases and 351 deaths. In recent weeks, the number of active cases in the state has decreased, as has the average number of new cases reported. However, health officials caution that the virus is not finished spreading through Wyoming and have urged residents to continue taking it seriously.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/16/luchador-face-masks-kid-rock-citation-virtual-memorial-news-around-states/111968854/", "title": "Luchador face masks, Kid Rock cited: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The capital is now the heart of the state‚Äôs pandemic crisis after a two-week surge in new coronavirus cases rocketed Montgomery County past Alabama‚Äôs larger counties. The city‚Äôs 2,791 COVID-19 cases are the most in the state, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. More than 1,000 new cases have been confirmed over the past 14 days in Montgomery County, which at about 225,000 people is only the state‚Äôs fourth most populous. Fewer people have been tested in Montgomery County than Mobile County, the second hardest-hit, but the rate of positives is significantly higher around the capital. In a news release, the ADPH cited outbreaks at workplaces and long-term care facilities, although it noted that large gatherings during the Memorial Day holiday may have contributed to the surge. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed had proposed making mask-wearing mandatory but withdrew the idea earlier this month when it failed to gain support among the City Council. The county remains under a 10 p.m. nightly curfew that was implemented months ago.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Drivers will be able to drive through Denali National Park and Preserve on its only access road this summer after measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 reduced anticipated bus traffic in the park. The park service said vehicles will be allowed to access usually restricted portions of the park through a reservation system being rolled out in two stages, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The announcement came after the pandemic caused a stark decline in visitors. The reservation system allows the public to reserve one of a limited number of daily scheduled entries, park officials said, adding that visitors are able to access the road through June 30 with the Teklanika Road Permit. When tour, transit and camper bus services begin in July, visitors will also be able to access a different road to the Eielson Visitor Center with an Eielson Road Permit.\n\nArizona\n\nVermilion Cliffs National Monument: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has restored a walk-in lottery for one of the most exclusive and dramatic hiking spots in the Southwest. Half of the 20 daily permits for the Wave typically are awarded in person and half online. The agency suspended the walk-in lottery in March because it couldn‚Äôt ensure social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. The walk-in lottery resumed Monday. The Bureau of Land Management said it worked closely with Kane County in southern Utah to develop protections for the public‚Äôs health and safety. The lottery has drawn more than 100 people at times who crowded into the Kanab Visitor Center to vie for permits for use the following day. The hike takes visitors 6 miles round trip through a wide, sloping basin of searing reds, oranges and yellows in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument along the Arizona-Utah border.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has increased by more than 400, and there are two additional deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, the Arkansas Department of Health reported Sunday. The 12,501 confirmed cases and 179 deaths mark an increase of 406 cases and two deaths from Saturday‚Äôs numbers. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Meanwhile, Arkansas Children‚Äôs Hospital in Little Rock has announced plans to lay off 25 employees because of a decline in the number of patients as a result of the coronavirus. The hospital said in a news release that it is eliminating 42 positions, including 17 that are currently vacant, while laying off the others. The hospital is also reducing executive pay by 20% and pay to directors by 10%.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The state has recorded more than 5,000 COVID-19 deaths as cases continue to climb in several parts of California. On Sunday, the state Department of Public Health reported 148,855 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 5,063 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Last week, nine counties reported a spike in new cases or hospitalizations, some from Memorial Day holiday gatherings and others from prisons and nursing homes. The state is gradually reopening after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay-at-home order March 19. Retail stores and restaurants, followed by churches and hair salons, were allowed to reopen with restrictions. On Friday, hotels, zoos, museums and movie theaters were among the businesses cleared to reopen.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State lawmakers wound down a shortened 2020 session Saturday having drastically cut education funding because of the coronavirus pandemic‚Äôs revenue impact, allocating $70 million in federal aid to struggling business and residents, and passing a sweeping police transparency bill. After a 10-week hiatus forced by the coronavirus, lawmakers approved a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 that cut $3.3 billion from the $13 billion general fund. Lawmakers were still bargaining over a controversial bill introduced by Democrats days ago to suspend or reduce business tax credits to help make up the hit being taken by the budget and by public schools. Republicans and business leaders from across the state say that they weren‚Äôt consulted on the bill and that it will hurt businesses trying to survive in a pandemic that‚Äôs forced more than half a million workers across the state to seek unemployment benefits.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hartford HealthCare, one of the state‚Äôs largest health care systems, has begun easing some visitor restrictions at its hospitals and outpatient facilities across Connecticut now that there are fewer patients being treated for COVID-19. In an email Monday, the system said one visitor will be allowed at a time, and visitors must be age 16 or older, wear face masks, pass a screening for symptoms and maintain physical distancing while inside the hospital. Visiting hours will vary by facility and program. There will still be some restrictions on visiting at emergency departments, as well as critical and intensive care units and in oncology areas including infusion centers, medical oncology and radiation oncology.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: On the final weekend before phase two of reopening in the state began, the number of active coronavirus hospitalizations in the state dropped below 100 for the first time since early April. On both Friday and Saturday, the number of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 was 93, and the state has seen fewer than 25 new hospitalizations for five consecutive days, a trend that also hasn‚Äôt happened since the state started tracking and sharing those numbers. Phase two of the state‚Äôs reopening began Monday. Certain businesses can increase their capacity to 60%, and indoor gatherings can increase to 50 people. Another welcoming trend for state officials is the percentage of people testing positive. That number has hovered around 2% over the past four days, down from about 5% in the nine days prior, according to state data. Delaware has yet to have a day in June when 100 or more positive cases were added.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that D.C. may move to the second phase of reopening no earlier than Friday as officials analyze progress in the first phase, WUSA-TV reports. Bowser said in a press conference that the district is still in the process of figuring out what Phase 2 will look like. She said the city is still aiming for the June 19 reopening date as data continues to trend downward. On Monday, D.C. health officials reported no new deaths as a result of the coronavirus. ‚ÄúWe are going at the pace that we think the data says we should,‚Äù Bowser said. The district has also expanded its COVID-19 testing in neighborhoods and has begun offering free walk-up coronavirus testing at firehouses from 4 to 8 p.m.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Some bars and restaurants in the state are temporarily closing their doors after being back open for just a few weeks because workers or patrons have tested positive for the new coronavirus. The closures come as the number of new daily coronavirus confirmations in Florida on Sunday exceeded 2,000 cases for a second day in a row. In the Orlando suburb of Altamonte Springs, a restaurant closed temporarily after some patrons notified the owner about testing positive and some staffers started exhibiting symptoms, though not at work. ‚ÄúThis may seem like an extravagant step, however we are taking no chances with the health of our staff and our customers,‚Äù Kiwi‚Äôs Pub & Grill said in a Facebook posting. Three bars in downtown St. Petersburg and two restaurants in the city‚Äôs restaurant district temporarily closed recently after some staffers tested positive for the virus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The Athens-Clarke County police department partnered with First AME Church to help distribute food at the Georgia Square Mall on Monday. In a matter of hours, food from the USDA Food Box Program was headed to local churches and residents. The effort was part of continuing efforts to help out those in need during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The state‚Äôs coronavirus infection rate in long-term care facilities is the lowest in the nation because of statewide efforts to contain its spread, officials said. Healthcare Association of Hawaii President and CEO Hilton Raethel said the infection statistic is based on data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Hawaii‚Äôs long-term care facilities have been protected from COVID-19 because communities throughout the state have kept case numbers low, Raethel said. Bruce Anderson, director of the state Department of Health, said there has been only one patient in the state‚Äôs long-term care facilities with a confirmed case of the coronavirus, at a care home on Maui. Three employees at long-term facilities have tested positive for the virus, and the health department is investigating a potential fourth case at ‚Äúone of the largest care homes in the state,‚Äù Anderson said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials will delay the repair of an impassable northern Idaho road in important grizzly bear habitat near the Canadian border because of a lawsuit filed by environmentalists, according to court documents filed last week. Work to reopen about 5 miles of the dirt road because of threats to border security had been scheduled to start Monday but has now been put off until the summer of 2021, the documents said. The Center for Biological Diversity and four other environmental groups in March sued the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, contending that repairing the road and opening it to vehicles would harm grizzly bears, mountain caribou and other wildlife in the Selkirk Mountains.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An online memorial has been created to remember thousands of Chicagoans who have died after being infected with the coronavirus. Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the virtual memorial‚Äôs launch Friday. People can submit stories about family, friends and neighbors through the city‚Äôs website. More than 2,300 residents of the city have died since the start of the pandemic, according to Chicago public health officials. ‚ÄúIn light of the current situation, the way we mourn and celebrate one‚Äôs life needs to be reimagined,‚Äù Lightfoot said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Virtual Memorial is just one way to help Chicagoans cope with the sudden loss of their loved one to COVID-19, but also to celebrate their lives and memories.‚Äù\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state has now seen more than 40,000 cases of coronavirus, after it reported 553 new positive test results and 11 new deaths, bringing Monday‚Äôs total case count to 40,430 new cases and 2,251 deaths. The state also updated its number for long-term care facilities to include 71 new deaths, for a total of 1,082, and 331 new cases, for a total of 4,942. Marion County reported 130 new cases Monday, bringing it to a total of 10,788 cases, with 651 deaths. Elkhart, which has seen its numbers rise sharply in recent weeks, saw 88 new cases, for a total of 2,168 cases with 34 deaths. Hamilton County saw a marked increase in reported cases, with 82 confirmed in the past two days, according to the state dashboard. Before Sunday, the highest number of cases confirmed in a single day for that county was 51 on March 13. But Hamilton County Health Department officials said they believe there was a double-reporting glitch with the data.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The 2020 Iowa State Fair is canceled, leaving central Iowa this August without corndogs, fried Oreos or pork chops on a stick. There will be no skyglider, bandstands or butter cow. And the cancellation could cost the city‚Äôs tourism industry $110million. Greg Edwards of Catch Des Moines, the metro‚Äôs tourism bureau, estimated the impact of the 2019 Iowa State Fair on central Iowa, including money spent at local hotels, retailers and tourist attractions. The Iowa State Fair draws more than a million people each year, making it the largest annual event in the state. It‚Äôs been canceled only five times in its 165 years ‚Äì the last time during World War II. When visiting families, some from other states or countries, have free time between their state fair revelries, Edwards said they flock to other Des Moines tourist attractions, such as the Blank Park Zoo, which is struggling with reduced attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The University of Kansas announced Monday that it will shorten the time students are on campus for the fall semester as it seeks to block a coronavirus wave. Under the plan, classes would begin in person as scheduled Aug. 24, and in-person instruction would end just before the Thanksgiving holiday, with students encouraged to leave campus, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. After Thanksgiving, there will be a week to study for finals, which will be done remotely as they were for the spring semester. ‚ÄúUndoubtedly, the fall semester will be unlike any in history. It will require flexibility, compassion and resilience,‚Äù Chancellor Douglas Girod said in a campus message. ‚ÄúAnd it will require each of us to behave responsibly and in a way that benefits the entire community. If this pandemic has taught us one thing, it‚Äôs that we are all in this together.‚Äù\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: A festival that shows off one of the state‚Äôs iconic products is being postponed this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Bourbon Festival was pushed back a month and is now scheduled for Oct. 15-18 in Bardstown, officials said in a news release. Last September‚Äôs 28th annual festival drew some 50,000 visitors from 40 states and more than 20 countries for its activities and concerts, the festival‚Äôs website said. The pandemic, business operations guidelines and time lost during spring planning time led to the decision, festival President and COO Randy Prasse said. Officials will continue monitoring government, health and tourism industry advice and also rely on the fest‚Äôs own best practices, he said. ‚ÄúIf we do have to cancel the event, we will but we owe it to our supporters and bourbon industry partners to make every effort to produce the 2020 Festival,‚Äù Prasse said in the release.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A hospital emergency room has reopened after five years, as part of the state‚Äôs coronavirus pandemic surge program. Baton Rouge General Hospital said in a news release that its Mid-City hospital‚Äôs 33-bed ER will be open for all sorts of emergencies. The emergency department reopened Monday under a contract with the Governor‚Äôs Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, which opened other unused areas earlier for acute care of patients with COVID-19. ‚ÄúWe will continue to offer acute care and keep the ER open as long as we have the support of the state,‚Äù said Edgardo Tenreiro, the hospital‚Äôs president and CEO. The contract signed March 30 will keep the facility open for at least six months, with the possibility of an 18-month extension, The Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Baxter State Park is again open for day visits. The park on Monday reopened Togue Pond and Matagamon gates for vehicle access on the park‚Äôs Tote Road. But campsites and cabins don‚Äôt open until July 1. Bunkhouses, which sleep eight to 10 people in congregate living, will remain closed for the summer. The easing of restrictions by the Baxter Park Authority comes as the administration of Gov. Janet Mills moves to reopen the economy. Other state parks and campgrounds already opened, but the Baxter State Park is run by an independent authority. Maine has had more than 2,800 cases of the virus and 101 deaths. The state recorded its first coronavirus-related death in nearly a week Monday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: At least two dozen nursing homes have been fined by the state because they failed to provide information on coronavirus cases and deaths. The Washington Post reports 24 Medicare-certified facilities were fined between $250 and $750 in early May. State officials said the facilities failed ‚Äúto submit daily reporting information.‚Äù That violated an executive order issued by Gov. Larry Hogan. Fran Phillips, the state‚Äôs deputy secretary for public health, said the rate of compliance for reporting was about 50% before the state started issuing fines. She said it was 98% Saturday. ‚ÄúWe wanted to know where the vulnerabilities were,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúIt was super, super important that we got compliance.‚Äù Nearly 12,000 staff and residents at Maryland long-term care facilities have contracted the virus, said Mike Ricci, Hogan‚Äôs spokesman. More than 1,700 have died.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts‚Äô two state-run soldiers‚Äô homes are resuming visits this week after they became hot spots for the coronavirus. The Chelsea Soldiers‚Äô Home began allowing visits outdoors starting Monday, while the Holyoke Soldiers‚Äô Home will begin allowing them Tuesday. The state‚Äôs Executive Office of Health and Human Services says all veteran residents and staff have been retested in preparation for resuming limited visitation. Eight residents tested positive for COVID-19 at the Holyoke home and six at the Chelsea home as of Friday, the office said. State officials say recreational activities, including supervised time outdoors, have also resumed for veterans at the Holyoke home, which was the site of one of the nation‚Äôs deadliest outbreaks of the virus in a nursing home. Veterans are also being trained to use iPads, which are being used for regular family communication through video chat, they said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state health department on Sunday confirmed three new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in Michigan to 5,770. About 60,000 people have tested positive, and thousands who were found to be positive by mid-May or earlier have recovered, the state said. As numbers have trended downward, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has eased many restrictions put in place to try to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus as the outbreak began in March. Barbershops, salons and spas were allowed to open Monday after months without business.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state reported 230 new cases and six more deaths from COVID-19 on Monday, but the number of hospitalizations continued to decline. State health officials said 353 people were hospitalized from the coronavirus, with 186 people in intensive care. The Star Tribune reports the number of hospitalizations has dipped to levels last seen in late April. It‚Äôs also far down from the 606 people hospitalized in late May, when major hospitals in the metro area were running out of intensive care beds, the Star Tribune reports. Minnesota so far has recorded 1,304 deaths and 30,693 cases of the virus. Two of the six people whose deaths were reported Monday were 60 or older; the other four were 70 or older. Most deaths in Minnesota have been in people 70 or older or with underlying health conditions before they contracted the virus, and most of those deaths have come in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: All 15 of the state‚Äôs community colleges are planning to offer on-campus classes during the fall semester, with new precautions implemented amid the coronavirus pandemic. The two-year colleges moved to online classes in mid-March as COVID-19 started to spread in Mississippi. ‚ÄúAlong with much excitement about getting back to campus, all of our colleges are taking the proper precautions to help keep our students, faculty, staff and visitors safe and healthy,‚Äù said Steve Bishop, who will soon begin a term as leader of the Mississippi Association of Community Colleges. Bishop is also president of Southwest Mississippi Community College. The state Health Department said Sunday that Mississippi has confirmed at least 19,516 cases and 891 deaths from the coronavirus as of Saturday evening. That was an increase of 168 cases and two deaths from the numbers reported a day earlier.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The public health orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus are getting even looser this week as the state continues its reopening effort. Larger cities like Springfield, Kansas City and St. Louis will still have some restrictions on businesses and other public gatherings. But in other areas, officials are set to drop the rules entirely. Starting Tuesday, there will be no statewide rules in effect. Gov. Mike Parson announced last week that he‚Äôd let his rules expire and trust Missourians to take ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù for their safety. That means that unless a local rule says otherwise, people will not have to stay 6 feet apart from non-family members in public. Retailers will not have to limit the number of customers in their stores, and restaurants will no longer have to enforce social distancing with dine-in customers. The state‚Äôs prohibition on most visits to nursing homes and similar facilities will also expire.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state saw another COVID-19 death over the weekend, while testing confirmed 37 new cases of the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, state officials said Monday. Big Horn County announced Saturday that a man in his 80s had died from COVID-19. His death was the second in the county and the 19th in the state. More than 3,900 tests were performed from Friday through Sunday, with 15 new cases announced Saturday, 14 on Sunday and eight on Monday. The new cases included 10 in Custer County and six in Gallatin County. Montana‚Äôs known case total stands at 609. Seven people are hospitalized, and 510 have recovered. The state reported 62 cases of COVID-19 from June 1 to 7, compared to 31 in the week prior.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: State health officials say four more COVID-19 deaths were reported over the weekend, bringing the state‚Äôs total to 216. Officials had reported 212 deaths as of Friday. The state‚Äôs online coronavirus tracker also showed a jump in cases confirmed over the weekend, including 120 new cases Saturday and 92 new cases Sunday, to take Nebraska‚Äôs total to 16,725. Hospital capacity remained steady Monday, with 43% of the state‚Äôs hospital beds, 53% of its intensive care unit beds and 76% of its respirators available for use. The new cases were reported as coronavirus cases have been rising in states across the U.S. Despite the rising numbers, most states ‚Äì including Nebraska ‚Äì are rolling back restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Long lines were already forming Monday morning ahead of the reopening of Nevada DMV offices. KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports people began lining up hours before Department of Motor Vehicle offices opened their doors. DMV offices in the state have been closed for nearly three months to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Now under new guidelines, offices will maintain 50% capacity. Employees will be practicing social distancing. DMV officials are allowing only people severely affected by the closures to access services for the first 30 days after the reopening. These include people who have a driver‚Äôs license suspension, no valid form of ID or a newly purchased vehicle with no license plates. A driver‚Äôs license or other DMV document that has an expiration date from March 16 through July 14 will get an automatic extension.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Restaurants in the state reopened for indoor dining Monday. Eateries initially were restricted to takeout and delivery after Gov. Chris Sununu issued a stay-at-home order in March. Outdoor dining resumed May 18, and as of Monday, indoor dining is allowed at tables spread 6 feet apart. Restaurants in Rockingham, Hillsborough, Merrimack and Strafford counties are limited to 50% capacity, however, not just because the vast majority of the state‚Äôs COVID-19 cases have occurred there but because of their proximity to the Massachusetts border. Monday marked the first day of the state‚Äôs move from a stay-at-home order to what Sununu has called a ‚Äúsafer at home‚Äù advisory.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: Outdoor dining, in-person retail and curbside pickup at libraries in the state are among the services that reopened Monday from their COVID-19 pause. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said previously that Monday would mark the start of Stage 2 of reopening the state from the coronavirus outbreak. Child care services are also cleared to reopen, the administration said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big day,‚Äù Murphy said on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre slowly but surely getting back on our feet.‚Äù He lifted the statewide stay-home order last week but said residents would still have to abide by limits of no more than 50 people indoors and up to 100 people outside. New Jersey is among the worst-hit states from the virus, with a death toll of 12,625 and nearly 167,000 positive cases.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials on Sunday reported 104 new coronavirus cases and four additional deaths. Officials said testing has now confirmed 9,723 cases. A total of 435 New Mexico residents have died of the virus. Five counties ‚Äì Bernalillo, Dona Ana, Sandoval, McKinley and San Juan ‚Äì each had more than 10 new cases. New cases were also reported at a pair of correctional facilities. Five were found among federal detainees held at the Torrance County Detention Facility, and 14 state prison inmates being held at the Orero County Detention Facility were found to be infected. As of Sunday, the state‚Äôs hospitals were caring for 162 people with COVID-19.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Up to 25 people can gather in parts of the state that have entered the third phase of reopening, under a revised plan the governor announced Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he relaxed the rules because of signs of a continued decline in hospitalizations and the percentage of new positive cases across the state. Cuomo‚Äôs administration reported 25 deaths of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in New York hospitals and nursing homes Sunday. Just over 1,600 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, and a smaller percentage of New Yorkers have been testing positive each day in recent weeks. New York is on the ‚Äúright track,‚Äù said Cuomo, who has divided the state up into 10 regions that are all in different stages of reopening. Previously, only 10 people could gather in the third phase of reopening, which western New York is set to enter Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state‚Äôs highest court made history Monday by hearing oral arguments using videoconferencing as the court system continues to attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The state judicial system said the cases marked the first time oral arguments were heard using remote technology since the court convened in 1819. State Supreme Court justices listened online from their offices to lawyers representing plaintiffs and defendants in cases involving insurance companies and a hospital. Ten cases are scheduled to be heard using this method through Wednesday. Members of the public can watch the remote arguments online. The state Court of Appeals made similar history April 30 when a three-judge panel of the court heard arguments through videoconferencing. Other courts are using similar technology as in-person hearings have been scaled back due to the coronavirus.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials have reported 22 new COVID-19 cases in the state but no additional deaths. The state Department of Health said that as of Sunday morning, the state has seen 3,080 cases and 74 deaths since the pandemic began. Fifty-six of those deaths have occurred in long-term care facilities. Nearly 200 people have been hospitalized; 35 are currently hospitalized. Almost 2,600 people have recovered.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Bellwether Music Festival announced the 2020 event‚Äôs cancellation Monday morning. Organizers of the three-day fest that had been slated for August cited conditions surrounding COVID-19 and current mandates from the government. ‚ÄúThe safety and health of our guests, artists, partners, and staff are always our first priority,‚Äù Bill Donabedian, co-founder of the festival, said in a press release. The announcement comes after many other fairs and festivals across the state have released similar notices. Others still are looking to keep their events alive in some way. Both the Darke and Lorain county fairs are holding drive-thru events where patrons can purchase fair food from the comfort of their cars. Some festivals, like the Cincinnati Juneteenth Festival, held on the weekend of June 19, will be moving their events to a virtual space.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: With the number of coronavirus cases in the state rising by record levels in recent days, the director of the Tulsa Health Department says he wishes President Donald Trump would again postpone a planned rally in the city. The Trump campaign has already postponed the rally at the BOK Center from Friday to Saturday after criticism that the event would coincide with Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the country, and will take place just blocks from the site of a massacre that left hundreds of African Americans dead in 1921. Health Department director Bruce Dart said Saturday that it was a matter of pride that the president has chosen Tulsa for his first campaign rally this season, but it is still too dangerous because of the risk of coronavirus transmission. ‚ÄúI wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn‚Äôt as large a concern as it is today,‚Äù Dart told the Tulsa World. The 19,000-seat BOK Center has canceled all other events through the end of July. The Trump campaign has acknowledged the risk. A waiver attendees must sign absolves the campaign of any responsibility should people get sick.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: A study by Oregon State University to determine the spread of the novel coronavirus is expanding to one of the most recent hot spots in the state. University researchers, in collaboration with local public health officials, will conduct two days of community sampling in Newport this weekend, officials announced Monday. The expansion of the Team-based Rapid Assessment of Community-Level Coronavirus Epidemics, or TRACE, comes after more than 120 cases were found at a Pacific Seafoods plant in Newport. The study team will then assist with contract tracing for any positive tests it finds during the effort to canvas the community. ‚ÄúThe results from the TRACE team‚Äôs community sampling will give the community current prevalence data and inform a better picture of how COVID-19 moves through rural communities,‚Äù said Bob Cowen, director of the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport. More information about the study‚Äôs progress and results can be found online.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf‚Äôs administration said Monday that more free coronavirus drive-thru testing sites will open in Walmart parking lots across northern Pennsylvania as it seeks to expand testing to areas where there is little available. Nine more sites will open Wednesday at Walmart parking lots in Sayre, State College, Edinboro, New Castle, Grove City, Coal Township, Selinsgrove, Lewisburg and Mansfield, the administration said. That brings the total number of free coronavirus drive-thru testing sites in Walmart lots to 19, it said. The sites will be open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. People seeking a test must register online a day in advance and must print out a voucher and bring it with them to the testing site. Test results are to be emailed within a day or two, and a physician will call a patient who tested positive, the administration said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has spent just $44 million of the $1.25 billion the state received in federal aid to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Transparency Portal‚Äù the state launched Friday. The website developed by Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo‚Äôs administration breaks down the state‚Äôs spending of its Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act money. The website shows that the state had spent just $44 million of the funds as of May 26 and committed another $143 million of the money for future spending. Among the major expenses was roughly $9 million in payments to Dimeo Construction to build three field hospitals that went mostly unused, as the state never saw the expected surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The state‚Äôs emergency management leaders have spent millions of dollars on coronavirus-related supplies and equipment since the state‚Äôs first emergency declaration in March, from $1.9million for N95 masks from a fastener distributor to $2,500 for boxed meals from Chick-fil-A. From March 16 through April, the state‚Äôs Emergency Management Division spent an estimated $49.5 million on purchases from 64 different private companies, primarily on behalf of counties that submitted requests through local emergency management offices. The money spent on food ‚Äì totaling $585,312 ‚Äì provided sustenance to personnel handling COVID-related meetings, testing sites and other duties, Emergency Management Division spokesperson Derrec Becker said. ‚ÄúWorking consecutive shifts and 24-hour operations means people need to eat,‚Äù Becker said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt go out and get their own meals.‚Äù\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State health officials reported 65 new COVID-19 cases in the state as of Sunday. The state health department said that as of Sunday morning, the state had seen 5,898 cases and 75 deaths. Minnehaha County leads the state with 3,479 cases, followed by Beadle County with 446. Nearly 4,900 people have recovered across the state. Eighty-seven people are currently hospitalized. About 52% percent of the state‚Äôs hospital beds remain available.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Health officials have cited 14 Nashville businesses including a restaurant owned by singer Kid Rock for not complying with coronavirus public health orders. Metro Public Health Department Director Michael Caldwell visited Kid Rock‚Äôs Big Ass Honky Tonk & Rock N‚Äô Roll Steakhouse on Saturday after receiving a complaint, news outlets report, citing a statement from the health department. Caldwell issued a citation ‚Äúfor serving people that were seated at the bar and for not observing proper social distancing inside the establishment.‚Äù The business will be fined, with the amount decided during a court hearing, officials said. Attorney Brian Lewis, who represents the owner of Kid Rock‚Äôs Honky Tonk and other businesses, said the citation was ‚Äúselective prosecution,‚Äù and lawyers intend to fight it.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: A local luchador is using his fame in the ring and his skills as a tailor by trade to bring to life some pride for the Mexican Lucha during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Laredo Morning Times reports. Local wrestler El Universitario ‚Äì he prefers to protect his true identity from the public ‚Äì is doing this by making customizable face masks of legendary Mexican wrestlers Blue Demon, El Santo and Mil Mascaras. Business has been steady, and he works almost every day. El Universitario said his prices are reasonable and vary depending on the masks. His most common face masks, which are the traditional common luchador design and white color, are sold at three masks for $10. However, for more complex orders that involve more detail, such as one of Blue Demon, the masks can run roughly $30.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: After a three-month period of relying on Netflix, Hulu or other streaming services for movies, southern Utahns will soon be able to go out and see a movie. Megaplex Theatres will reopen this week at most of its locations across the state, with openings slated from Logan to St. George, the company announced Friday. Although most theaters are scheduled to reopen Thursday, the remaining Megaplex locations in Utah and Nevada will open ‚Äúas soon as possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Intermission is finally over!‚Äù Megaplex Theatres president Blake Andersen said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur team is ready. Our buildings are ready. Our technology is ready, and we are thrilled to be welcoming guests back to Megaplex Theatres to enjoy great movies on the biggest screens in Utah.‚Äù The theaters will reopen with a set list of guidelines, which include limits on the number of allowed movie watchers for any one showing and regular wellness checks for employees.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Monday extended for another month the state of emergency imposed to help the state cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. During his regular briefing, Scott said that while he is extending the state of emergency first imposed in March through July 15, the state will continue its gradual reopening. As part of the reopening, Scott said the state‚Äôs campgrounds are now allowed to be open at full capacity, and all sectors of Vermont‚Äôs economy are open to some degree. Despite a spike of cases in Winooski, the state‚Äôs overall virus numbers look good, and if that trend continues, the reopening will continue, he said. In addition to watching what‚Äôs happening in Vermont, officials are keeping an eye on neighboring states, Scott said. ‚ÄúWe have to remember, Vermont is not an island and that this isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúWe still have about 130,000 active cases within a five-hour drive of us.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Many museums have started reopening after being shuttered for three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. Phase 2 of Gov. Ralph Northam‚Äôs reopening plan began June 5, allowing museums to reopen with restrictions, including the wearing of face masks inside buildings. The Roanoke Times reports guides at Historic Smithfield, a re-creation of 18th-century frontier life in Appalachia, added face masks to their Colonial outfits of petticoats and caps for the reopening Saturday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just really excited to have people out again,‚Äù Executive Director Ryan Spencer said. Blacksburg Museum & Cultural Foundation also reopened its Alexander Black House museum and art gallery Wednesday with social distancing measures in place. But not all cultural attractions appear ready for visitors. According to their websites, both Roanoke‚Äôs Taubman Museum of Art and Harrison Museum of African American Culture remain closed.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A prison is restricting movement in its medium-security unit after more than 100 officers and inmates tested positive for COVID-19. More than 1,800 of the 2,248 inmates at Coyote Ridge Corrections Center are in quarantine because of potential exposure to the coronavirus, the state Department of Corrections said. The announcement came after 30 corrections officers and 71 inmates tested positive, department officials said, adding that another 33 people exhibited potential symptoms. ‚ÄúThe health and safety of Corrections staff, the incarcerated individuals, and the citizens in the community remains our top priority,‚Äù department secretary Stephen Sinclair said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A coronavirus outbreak at a church has grown to 28 cases, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The outbreak last week at the Graystone Baptist Church in Lewisburg has led to additional available testing for the public in Greenbrier County. Justice said the National Guard conducted decontamination efforts at the church Sunday. He said the outbreak was close to his Lewisburg home. ‚ÄúThis could be your community tomorrow,‚Äù Justice said. ‚ÄúThis could be your church tomorrow. This could be your family tomorrow.‚Äù The church said the source of the outbreak is unknown. It had made previous services available for online viewing. It has since closed for two weeks and canceled Sunday services. In a statement on Facebook, the church said it adhered to mandated precautions, including social distancing and the availability of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer to churchgoers. It marked the fifth virus outbreak involving a West Virginia church.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Fewer people are hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 than at any point since April 4, according to Monday‚Äôs updated numbers from the Wisconsin Hospital Association. Hospitalizations have fallen rapidly after steadily rising throughout May, from 414 hospitalized with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis May 31 to 284 on Monday morning. Of those, 100 patients were in intensive care. Another 196 inpatients were awaiting test results. State health officials also announced the second-lowest single-day increase in newly confirmed cases this month, with 174 cases Monday bringing the total to 22,932. The lowest was 140 on June 1. Monday also saw a dip in newly reported tests, but that has been common on Mondays and may reflect a decline in testing or reporting over the weekend.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Backwards Distilling Company has produced thousands of gallons of hand sanitizer as supplies run short during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The distillery was preparing a batch of its 307 Vodka in mid-March when the pandemic hit. The batch would become something different than what the owners had intended, a scarce product people needed as the coronavirus reached Wyoming. Many people called to ask if the company could make hand sanitizer as distilleries around the country began making the product, Backwards co-owner Amber Pollock said. The distillery has since produced thousands of gallons, first in a partnership with other Wyoming distilleries and state government to meet needs for medical facilities and first responders. Backwards began selling sanitizer to the public and other businesses once the owners knew they could produce enough.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/09/cast-blues-wedding-dress-scare-rhino-escape-news-around-states/118789038/", "title": "Cast of Blues, wedding dress scare: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state attorney general‚Äôs office is trying to revive its lawsuit over the removal of a Confederate monument from outside a courthouse in the city. The state claimed in court documents that a judge shouldn‚Äôt have dismissed the suit just because someone anonymously paid a $25,000 fine that was owed by Madison County for removing the statue nearly a year ago, WHNT-TV reports. Attorney General Steve Marshall‚Äôs office contends the county should be required to pay the penalty itself. A judge scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon on the state‚Äôs bid to reinstate the lawsuit. The state sued the county last year seeking a $25,000 penalty that‚Äôs mandated under a state law that makes it illegal to remove or alter monuments. Madison County asked a judge to end the state‚Äôs suit after someone deposited $25,000 into a court account to pay the fine Aug. 27. The county says the money isn‚Äôt from taxpayers or Madison County but hasn‚Äôt said where it came from. Circuit Judge Claude Hundley dismissed the suit, but the state argues it needs to know who paid the fine to end the case. It also says the judge still needs to rule on its claim that Madison County broke the law by moving the monument, erected in 1905 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to a city-owned cemetery.\n\nAlaska\n\nNewtok: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pace of moving residents from a community threatened by erosion to another village, officials said. Money also has been an issue. Nine homes in the new village of Mertarvik that were started last year remain unfinished, and no one has moved from Newtok to Mertarvik since 2019, KYUK Public Media reports. Newtok had an estimated 220 residents last year. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt get any cabinets because of this COVID thing,‚Äù said Phillip Carl, Newtok acting tribal administrator. Patrick LeMay, who is leading the building effort in Mertarvik, said shortages for materials have persisted. ‚ÄúWe got 48 lights that are trapped somewhere in Tennessee floods, to finish the lighting. There‚Äôs a shortage of fire extinguishers in the nation,‚Äù LeMay said. ‚ÄúThe supply chain has been a disaster.‚Äù Many of the workers building homes in Mertarvik are Newtok residents. LeMay said three workers from Newtok contracted COVID-19 in August. Many remaining laborers chose to stop working due to concerns about an outbreak, KYUK reports. Newtok recently experienced its biggest outbreak since the pandemic began, with 32 residents testing positive for the coronavirus last month. About 42% of its population is vaccinated. Meanwhile, Carl said Newtok has lost over 100 feet of its coast since April.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Tuesday that Tucson‚Äôs vaccine mandate for its employees is illegal, giving the city 30 days to repeal it or risk losing millions of dollars in state funding. Democratic-led Tucson has repeatedly clashed with the state‚Äôs Republican leadership over the city‚Äôs aggressive efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. City Manager Michael Ortega said he put the mandate on hold while Tucson develops its legal position in response to the attorney general‚Äôs decision. Brnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate in a crowded Republican primary, cited a state law approved this summer that bans local governments from mandating vaccines for employees, though it doesn‚Äôt take effect until later this month. He also cited an August executive order signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. ‚ÄúAdhering to the rule of law in Arizona is not optional,‚Äù Katie Conner, a spokeswoman for Brnovich, told reporters. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero suggested Brnovich‚Äôs decision was motivated by his Senate campaign. ‚ÄúThis report reads more as a campaign speech filled with political commentary rather than a fact-based legal opinion,‚Äù the Democratic mayor said in a statement. City officials are reviewing their options, Romero said, and the next step will have to be decided by her and City Council.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 38 new deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday as the capital city launched a new incentive program to boost vaccinations. The Department of Health said the state‚Äôs death toll from the pandemic now totals 7,108. The state reported 583 new coronavirus cases, and COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by eight to 1,228. Arkansas ranks 10th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state‚Äôs top health official has warned he expects to see a surge in cases following the Labor Day weekend, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he expected an increase as well. ‚ÄúWe have fewer cases from the Labor Day weekend, but we‚Äôll see the effects of the holiday weekend later this week and into the next,‚Äù Hutchinson tweeted. Little Rock launched its incentive program tied to vaccination clinics it is holding, starting Saturday at the Southwest Community Center. Those who get shots at these clinics will receive a $50 VISA Rewards Card from U.S. Bank for both their first and second doses of vaccine received at a participating clinic. Those who provide proof of having gotten a first vaccine dose elsewhere and choose to get their second dose at a participating clinic, or those who receive a single-dose vaccine at a participating clinic, can receive a $100 Rewards Card.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers have moved to make the state the first to outlaw ‚Äústealthing,‚Äù which is removing a condom without permission during intercourse. Legislators sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill Tuesday adding the act to the state‚Äôs civil definition of sexual battery. It makes it illegal to remove the condom without obtaining verbal consent. But it doesn‚Äôt change the criminal code. Instead, it would amend the civil code so that a victim could sue the perpetrator for damages, including punitive damages. Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia has been pushing for the legislation since 2017, when a Yale University study said acts of stealthing were increasing against women and gay men alike. Her original bill attempted to make it a crime. But legislative analysts said at the time that the act could already be considered misdemeanor sexual battery, even if it isn‚Äôt specifically referenced in the criminal code. Even so, the analysts said it is rarely prosecuted, if only because of the difficulty in proving that a perpetrator acted intentionally instead of accidentally. Analysts this year said Garcia‚Äôs bill would remove any ambiguity in civil law. Garcia said the act can cause long-term physical and emotional harm to its victims.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city has closed Civic Center Park, one of its historic landmarks that has become a hot spot for homeless people to camp, because of safety and public health concerns, city officials said in a statement Tuesday. City officials said the park and surrounding areas have become a ‚Äúhotspot for violence, crime, drug sales and substance misuse, jeopardizing the public‚Äôs ability to safely enjoy one of Denver‚Äôs treasured outdoor spaces.‚Äù Officials cited concerns about rodents, disease spread, impacts on water quality, discarded needles and other drug paraphernalia in a statement in which Mayor Michael B. Hancock said conditions had reached a ‚Äútipping point.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis cannot and will not be allowed to continue,‚Äù Hancock said. The park was closed to the public starting Wednesday. Officials called it temporary but did not provide an exact date for its reopening. The city said it plans to restore the park‚Äôs greenery and historical stone structures that have been damaged by graffiti and fires and will require professional restoration. The park faces the state‚Äôs Capitol building and Lincoln Park, which was fenced off last summer after the city cleared a large camp of homeless people who were living there. Officials had cited health and safety concerns for issuing Lincoln Park‚Äôs cleanup, also referred to as ‚Äúhomeless sweeps‚Äù by local housing advocates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: An independent investigator will look into allegations of racial discrimination within the police department including unfair discipline of Black officers and a hostile work environment, city officials said. The probe is in response to claims against acting Police Chief Rebeca Garcia made by the Bridgeport Guardians, a group that represents minority officers on the force, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. City Council President Aidee Nieves said Bridgeport will be hiring an outside attorney to review the allegations. The Guardians, however, are continuing to insist that federal government officials investigate the department. Davon Polite, president of the Guardians, said there are concerns that city officials will hire a lawyer who will produce the results they want. ‚ÄúA federal investigation is the only way to get an impartial, fair investigation,‚Äù Polite said. The Guardians and the local NAACP branch recently requested federal oversight of the department and an investigation, alleging a widespread pattern of racial discrimination within the agency. The Guardians accuse Garcia of subjecting minority officers to disparate treatment and a hostile work environment. The group has called for her removal. The city police union voted no confidence in Garcia in March.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Chancery Court judge ruled protests may continue outside the house of Delaware Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney, denying the state‚Äôs request for a temporary restraining order. The proposed restrictions, made by the state Department of Justice after it perceived threats against the agency‚Äôs Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust head, sought to keep protesters 300 feet from Denney‚Äôs home. Demonstrators would also have to notify New Castle County Police at least 24 hours before they protested. In making her ruling Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick said there was not enough for her to go on to issue a temporary restraining order. She attributed that to the speed at which the proceedings were brought to her on Sunday of Labor Day Weekend. But she said the motion to expedite the proceeding could move forward. A date for the next hearing was not provided. Keandra McDole Ray, one of the people targeted by the motion, viewed the ruling as a positive outcome for demonstrators, who have been protesting that Denney ‚Äúdo his job‚Äù in the matter of Lymond Moses ‚Äì a 30-year-old man killed during a Jan. 13 interaction with New Castle County Police in Wilmington.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: One of the biggest rock bands in the world will take the stage at D.C.‚Äôs 9:30 Club on Thursday night as the final part of the venue‚Äôs reopening week celebration, WUSA-TV reports. The club, which had been teasing a surprise musical guest for a few weeks, posted on social media Wednesday that the Foo Fighters had been tapped to help welcome fans back. This won‚Äôt be the first venue Dave Grohl and company have helped to reopen from long pandemic-induced closures. Back in June, the band reopened New York‚Äôs Madison Square Garden with a little help from D.C. native Dave Chappelle. But the 9:30 Club has a special connection to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band‚Äôs leader. As a teenager, Grohl played drums in a band called Dane Bramage at the 9:30 Club. ‚ÄúAs a kid growing up in the D.C. punk rock scene, your first show at the 9:30 Club might as well have been Royal Albert Hall or Madison Square Garden,‚Äù Grohl told the Washington Post in a 2010 article celebrating the venue‚Äôs 30th anniversary. The 9:30 Club is one of several D.C. venues requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of an event.\n\nFlorida\n\nIslamorada: A 148-year-old Florida Keys lighthouse could get a new life now that a community organization is poised to take ownership and begin a massive preservation project. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has approved a recommendation from the National Park Service that Islamorada-based Friends of the Pool Inc. be granted ownership of Alligator Reef Lighthouse under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The nonprofit announced the approval Tuesday. ‚ÄúAlligator Reef Lighthouse has stood since 1873,‚Äù project organizer Rob Dixon said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an important part of Islamorada‚Äôs local history. It‚Äôs our Statue of Liberty and needs to be saved.‚Äù Dixon said the restoration project is likely to take five to seven years and cost up to $9 million. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need a lot of fundraising help and a lot of technical help,‚Äù he said. Friends of the Pool hosts an annual 8-mile swimming race to the offshore lighthouse and back to fund collegiate scholarships. The effort to save the lighthouse and start the ‚ÄúSwim for Alligator Lighthouse‚Äù event was conceived by Larry Herlth, a local metal artisan who created detailed replicas of Alligator Reef Lighthouse and other Keys lighthouses. ‚ÄúThe six lighthouses off the Florida Keys are the biggest collection of iron piling lighthouses anywhere in the world,‚Äù Herlth said. ‚ÄúThe history is just phenomenal.‚Äù\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A metro-area school district is switching to virtual learning, after two school bus drivers and a bus monitor died from COVID-19 in recent weeks. The 9,700-student Griffin-Spalding County school system, on the southern fringe of suburban Atlanta, made the announcement late Monday, citing a disruption in student transportation. Districts across Georgia are struggling to line up enough drivers and monitors to keep buses running. In Savannah, some bus drivers staged a sickout for the second day Tuesday after a similar protest Friday. At least 210,000 Georgia students in 54 districts and charter networks have had their school schedules disrupted because of COVID-19. Some districts have taken days off, some shifted to every-other-day schedules, and some sent home individual schools or grades. That‚Äôs over 12% of Georgia‚Äôs 1.7 million public school students. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals remains above 6,000, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. The number of newly reported deaths continues to rise sharply, with Georgia currently averaging more than 80 deaths a day, totaling more than 23,000 since the pandemic began. More than 34,000 coronavirus cases have been reported among children ages 5-17 in the two weeks ended Sept. 2, state Department of Public Health data shows.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A resort in the famed tourist mecca of Waikiki will be the first in the state to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all employees and guests. Starting Oct. 15, ‚ÄôAlohilani Resort will require its employees, patrons and guests to show proof they‚Äôre fully inoculated. The requirement will also apply to the six other Waikiki properties owned or operated by Highgate, a real estate investment and hospitality management company. It‚Äôs the right thing to do as Hawaii grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations because of the highly contagious delta variant, said Kelly Sanders, senior vice president of operations at Highgate Hawaii. There were an average of 706 newly confirmed infection cases per day across Hawaii between Aug. 30 and Sept. 5 across Hawaii, according to the state Department of Health. Hawaii‚Äôs vaccination rate was 64%. ‚ÄúSo I think we will be the safest hotel in Hawaii, at least for now,‚Äù Sanders said Wednesday. ‚ÄúAnd hopefully that helps our business and doesn‚Äôt hurt our business.‚Äù John De Fries, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, called the move a step in a the right direction and said he hopes other hotels follow suit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state‚Äôs move to ‚Äúcrisis standards of care‚Äù is allowing some hospitals to ration health care as they struggle with an onslaught of coronavirus patients, and officials are warning the procedures could spread statewide. But the main hospital affected by the designation was already operating under extreme conditions, officials said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately we haven‚Äôt been really at our normal standards for some time,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Scoggins, the chief of staff for Kootenai Health, the largest hospital system in the northern half of the state. The Coeur d‚ÄôAlene facility has had to move patients into a conference center, ‚Äúdoing things that were not normal ‚Äì way outside of normal ‚Äì at times,‚Äù Scoggins said. Newly confimed coronavirus infection cases are surging, and Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S. At Kootenai Health, some patients are treated in converted lobbies and hallways. Urgent surgeries are on hold, and critical patients must often wait long periods of time for intensive care beds, Scoggins said. ‚ÄúAlmost every day at this point we are having cardiac arrest from patients when their oxygen levels dip too low, and we can‚Äôt supply them with enough oxygen,‚Äù he said. An entire floor of the hospital has been turned into a COVID-19 ward, meaning medical staffers must put on full protective gear before they enter the floor.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson III has died at his home on Chicago‚Äôs North Side. He was 90. His son Adlai Stevenson IV, who confirmed the Illinois Democrat died Monday, said his father had dementia. Before his health declined, Stevenson kept active organizing presentations and speakers for the Adlai Stevenson Center on Democracy in Libertyville, Illinois. He also worked on the family farm in Hanover, Illinois, raising cattle, growing corn and hay for their feed, and chopping wood. ‚ÄúHe just faded away,‚Äù his son said. Stevenson ran for governor of Illinois twice, losing his 1982 run by just 5,074 votes to Republican Gov. Jim Thompson ‚Äì the closest election for governor in modern Illinois history. Stevenson was the great-grandson of former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, who served in the role for the second of President Grover Cleveland‚Äôs nonconsecutive terms. His father, Adlai Stevenson II, was a former Illinois governor and two-time presidential candidate. When running for the Senate, where he was first elected in 1970 to serve out the remainder of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen‚Äôs term, the third Stevenson asked then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley for advice. ‚ÄúMy advice to you is don‚Äôt change your name,‚Äù Daley told him, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Stevenson was reelected in 1974 but decided not to run again in 1980.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Secured School Safety Board has approved more than $19 million in state grants, marking a third consecutive year the General Assembly has allocated funds for school safety investments. The awards will allow the board to fund projects proposed by 392 schools in their applications to the Secured School Safety Grant program. The program issues matching grants for school resource officers and law enforcement officers in schools, active event warning systems, firearms training for teachers and staff, threat assessments, and other safety technology and support services. Schools then match those funds at a certain level, based on average daily membership of the school district, the total amount of the project or what the request covers. ‚ÄúHoosier students and staff should be able to go to school with the confidence and comfort of knowing they are safe and protected from harm. This program represents the state‚Äôs commitment to that mission,‚Äù Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement. The allocation of funds for the fiscal year includes roughly $13.4 million for school resource officers, $4.9 million for safety equipment, $642,000 for student and parent support services programs, $43,000 for active event warning services, and $6,200 for training.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: The city‚Äôs public schools will become the new owners of the historic Orpheum Theater for the basement-bargain price of $1. Marshalltown Community School District Board of Education on Tuesday unanimously approved a letter of intent to buy the theater on Main Street, the Times-Republican reports. The school district will pay the current owners, Iowa Valley Community College District, $1 for the building at closing. The closing date has been set for June 16 or sooner. The school board also approved a $20,000 purchase of a parking lot immediately east of the theater. The Orpheum closed last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Iowa Valley Community College District Chancellor Kristie Fisher said her school views the sale as more of a transfer of property from one school to another, and she‚Äôs proud the theater will remain an educational facility. ‚ÄúWe knew it was a great community asset and so important to the greater Marshall County community that we wanted to make sure we were maximizing it,‚Äù Fisher said. She said that while the $1 sale doesn‚Äôt appear to be a money-maker for the community college district, it will save the institution the costs of operating the theater, freeing up funds for other priorities. The downtown Orpheum Theater was built in 1948.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: After months of advocacy by activists, the City Council has voted to establish a board to advise the council and city staff on environmental concerns, climate change and economic vitality. The council voted unanimously Tuesday to support Wichita‚Äôs Sustainability Integration Board, which will advise in such areas as reducing emissions and finding economic growth that is environmentally friendly. The council had listened to 27 Wichita citizens during the past six months who spoke about climate change concerns, The Wichita Eagle reports. As currently planned, the board will have 14 members and meet quarterly. Some of the advocates and some council members said the board was too big and should meet more often. The board will be able to create its own bylaws and procedures, including determining how often members meet. ‚ÄúI think this is a great first step forward, and I don‚Äôt think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good,‚Äù Mayor Brandon Whipple said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers took initial steps Tuesday to block statewide mask mandates, showing their preference for local decision-making on the issue as they reconvened for a special session to assert their dominance in shaping Kentucky‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a daylong burst of action, a Senate committee advanced a measure to nullify the state school board‚Äôs requirement that anyone in a public K-12 school wear a mask. The bill would leave it up to local school boards to decide face-covering policies for their districts. A House panel advanced another bill to prevent the governor from issuing any new statewide orders requiring mask-wearing. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear previously used a mask mandate to combat the coronavirus‚Äô spread. He lifted it but has said he would have reinstituted a requirement to counter a recent COVID-19 surge if he still had the authority. The session marks a dramatic power shift in coronavirus-related policymaking in the Bluegrass State. Since the pandemic hit Kentucky, Beshear mostly acted unilaterally in setting statewide virus policies, but the state Supreme Court shifted those decisions to the Legislature in a landmark ruling. Dozens of school districts have paused in-person learning because of virus outbreaks as the state sets records for new cases and hospitalizations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State health officials said Tuesday that they are revoking the licenses of nursing homes that evacuated residents to a warehouse where seven died amid deteriorating conditions deemed too squalid to be safe after Hurricane Ida. The seven homes ‚Äì all owned by one person ‚Äì ‚Äúclearly failed to execute their emergency preparedness plans to provide essential care and services to their residents,‚Äù Department of Health Secretary Courtney Phillips said in a statement. Authorities found some nursing home residents lying on mattresses on the floor, without food or clean clothes, and detected strong odors of urine and feces throughout the warehouse, located in the town of Independence. Piles of trash were on the floor. Water entered the building, and generators at least temporarily failed, according to officials. Health department lawyer Stephen Russo called the conditions ‚Äúinhumane.‚Äù State health officials and Attorney General Jeff Landry have launched investigations into the deaths. A police official said the Tangipahoa Parish warehouse was equipped to handle 300 to 500 people but ultimately took in more than 800. Officials said the owner, Bob Dean, failed to contact them for help and threw inspectors from the agency off the property when they arrived to review the conditions onsite after receiving reports of problems.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The late founder of the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center has become the first Black Mainer to be inducted in the state‚Äôs Franco-American Hall of Fame. Alain Jean Claude Nahimana, who died at age 49 last year, was one of three people inducted posthumously during the ceremony Tuesday at the Maine State House. The son of a Burundi ambassador who fled political turmoil, Nahimana was educated in Burundi and Switzerland before moving to Maine in 2010. He served as the president of the Burundi Community Association and as coordinator of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition before launching the immigrant welcome center. There were a dozen inductees, including former House Speaker John Martin, of Eagle Lake, and state Sen. Susan Deschambault, of Biddeford. Dignitaries who attended the event included the French ambassador to the United States, Phillippe Etienne, along with Senate President Troy Jackson and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau. Gov. Janet Mills, who studied abroad for a year in Paris as a college student, delivered remarks in both French and English. She noted that more than a third of Maine residents have a Franco heritage.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A commission on congressional and state legislative redistricting has announced 12 public hearings. Ten of the hearings will be held in different parts of the state. The first will be Sept. 20, and the last is scheduled for Nov. 18. There also will be two statewide virtual hearings. The panel, which includes leading Democrats who control the General Assembly as well as two Republican legislative leaders, will draw maps for the state‚Äôs eight congressional districts as well as the 188 seats in the Legislature, based on new census data. Maryland‚Äôs current congressional map has been criticized as having some of the most gerrymandered and oddly-shaped districts in the nation. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1, Democrats hold a 7-1 advantage in its U.S. House delegation. Karl Aro, the former executive director of the Maryland Department of Legislative Services who is chairing the commission, said the geography should look ‚Äúprettier‚Äù this time in how the maps are drawn. He noted that in the past ‚Äúthings have gotten pretty free-hand-drawing like.‚Äù Aro said he‚Äôs hopeful people will not feel like their communities have been ‚Äúcarved 16 different ways.‚Äù\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shortage of bus drivers in the city‚Äôs public schools has been raising concern among parents who fear some students could be left behind when the district starts a new year Thursday. Acting Mayor Kim Janey and Superintendent Brenda Cassellius have told families to expect significant delays or bus cancellations, but details were not being provided to families until Thursday morning, The Boston Globe reports. The shortage is so severe that a union for bus drivers last week urged the district to postpone the start of classes. The district‚Äôs bus fleet was short more than 60 drivers at the time, and few had been added by this week. Families and advocates worry some students could end up stranded at home or at bus stops Thursday. The Boston Special Education Parent Advisory Council has raised concerns about students who need special education services including door-to-door transportation or individual bus monitors. ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know what to expect now and am concerned for families that don‚Äôt have the work flexibility, income, or resources to secure alternative transportation,‚Äù said Roxi Harvey, who chairs the council.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday proposed spending $200 million in federal pandemic relief funding to replace lead water pipes across the state, where aging underground infrastructure was exposed by Flint‚Äôs disaster. The plan, if approved by the Legislature, would set aside $20 million to replace all the lines in Benton Harbor in five years. The majority-Black city in the state‚Äôs southwestern corner has been exceeding the federal lead limit since 2018. That year, Michigan began enforcing the nation‚Äôs strictest rules for lead in drinking water in the wake of the crisis in Flint, another impoverished city with a majority-Black population. The regulations will result in replacing every lead service pipe statewide by 2041 unless a utility can show regulators it will take longer. The proposal would expand upon a water plan Whitmer announced nearly a year ago, including $102 million to replace lead service lines in disadvantaged communities. In June, Republicans who control the Senate unveiled a $2.5 billion water infrastructure proposal that would be funded primarily with federal COVID-19 aid. Their plan includes $600 million for pipe replacements, triple what the governor is seeking. Whitmer said more money is needed to replace all pipes but noted an infrastructure agenda pending in Congress.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A prominent GOP donor who is charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking is now being sued by an underage girl who says he used her for sex acts, then offered her money to keep her from talking about it. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court alleges that Anton Lazzaro‚Äôs attorneys offered $1,000 in hush money to the girl and her parents to keep them quiet and asked them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The girl‚Äôs father refused and instead went to law enforcement, said their attorney, Jeff Anderson. The lawsuit, which also lists the girl‚Äôs parents as plaintiffs, alleges Lazzaro used his ‚Äúpower, wealth, influence, connections, and resources to recruit children ‚Ä¶ so that he could prey on them. When it became clear that Lazzaro had committed serious crimes, he attempted to coerce his victims and their families into keeping silent.‚Äù Lazzaro, 30, was charged in August with five counts of sex trafficking of minors, one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor, one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and three counts of obstruction. His attorney has said he is being falsely accused. St. Thomas University student Gisela Castro Medina, 19, the former chairwoman of the school‚Äôs Republican Party chapter, also faces criminal charges for allegedly recruiting girls for Lazzaro.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: An exhibit about blues legends and juke joints is opening soon, designed to appeal to the eyes, hands and ears. A Cast of Blues will be on display starting Saturday and running through Oct. 9 at the Historic Eureka School in Hattiesburg. It features 15 resin-cast masks of blues legends and photographs of blues performers and juke joints made by Mississippi artists. Sharon McConnell-Dickerson created the resin-cast masks, and the photographs were taken by Ken Murphy. McConnell-Dickerson, who is visually impaired, said the casts are like 3-D photographs for people who are blind. ‚ÄúIt captures the flesh, muscle, bone, hair and subtle expressions of emotion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI wanted to discover the faces behind the music I love, so I went to Mississippi to map out the visages of the real Delta blues men and women.‚Äù The exhibit features Braille labels, a music playlist and a closed-captioned film about the Cast of Blues project. Visitors are encouraged to touch the masks, McConnell-Dickerson said. Among the artists spotlighted are Bo Diddley and Bobby Rush. The exhibit is also accompanied by the 2008 documentary film ‚ÄúM for Mississippi: A Road Trip through the Birthplace of the Blues.‚Äù\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Several people have been treated in emergency rooms after taking the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, even as experts warn of dangerous side effects and a lack of proof that it helps treat COVID-19. Dr. Steven Brown told KMOV-TV that cases of ivermectin toxicity have occurred at Mercy hospitals across the state. ‚ÄúPeople who are relying upon ivermectin and remaining unvaccinated are under a tremendous false sense of security,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúI have seen people with ivermectin toxicity in the emergency room from taking the animal formulation. I‚Äôve seen people who relied on ivermectin to prevent themselves from getting COVID who are on ventilators and who have died.‚Äù This week, the American Medical Association and two pharmacist groups urged physicians, pharmacists and other prescribers to warn patients against using ivermectin, a decades-old drug used to killed worms and other parasites in humans and animals. Large studies are underway in the U.S. and overseas to determine if the drug has any effect on preventing or reducing the effects of COVID-19. Ivermectin has been promoted by GOP lawmakers, conservative talk show hosts and some doctors, amplified via social media to millions still resistant to vacines. It has also been widely used in some other countries such as India and Brazil.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state‚Äôs Republican attorney general is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood last month seeking to block four new laws that would restrict access to abortion in the state. The laws, set to take effect Oct. 1, would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation; restrict access to abortion pills; require abortion providers to ask patients if they would like to view an ultrasound; and prohibit insurance plans that cover abortion procedures from being offered on the federal exchange. The lawsuit filed in Yellowstone District Court names Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen as a defendant. The state is represented in the case by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. The state asked Tuesday for the court to reject Planned Parenthood‚Äôs request to block the laws before they take effect, saying the laws will ‚Äúhelp minimize the medical risks‚Äù during pregnancy. But medical experts and abortion advocates broadly dispute that the new laws would make the procedure safer. The suit claims the laws violate the Montana Constitution, which protects access to abortion before the fetus is viable, generally at 24 weeks gestation. It says the laws will reduce the number of locations where abortion services are offered and threaten providers with civil and criminal penalties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A segment of the Henry Doorly Zoo was cleared out and visitors were warned to remain inside buildings after a 5,000-pound rhinoceros briefly escaped its enclosure, officials there confirmed. The incident happened Tuesday afternoon, when zookeepers spotted an Indian rhino named Jontu outside his enclosure grazing on grass in an area adjacent to the rhino barn that‚Äôs not open to the public, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Visitors were asked to leave the area or shelter in buildings, and the zoo‚Äôs carousel and aviary were cleared of guests as a precaution. Dan Cassidy, the zoo‚Äôs vice president of animal management, said staff quickly pulled in trucks to serve as a barricade around the area to keep the rhino from wandering and used apples and leafy greens to lure him back in the barn. In all, the rhino was outside the enclosure for about 40 minutes, Cassidy said. The animal never showed any signs of aggression while outside the barn, and the public was not in danger, Cassidy said. Vets were on hand with tranquilizer guns to be used as a last resort if needed. Zoo officials believe Jontu used his nose to push open a latch on a door that wasn‚Äôt locked properly. Cassidy said staff will critique the process of corralling the rhino and are considering changing the lock on the door from which he escaped.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The president of the school board for metro Las Vegas says she‚Äôs received death threats since the district approved a requirement for employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Clark County School District Board of Trustees President Linda Cavazos said on Twitter that the threats had ‚Äúvery disturbing images‚Äù but that she and her colleagues were continuing to do their jobs, KVVU-TV reports. ‚ÄúWe have no time for hate,‚Äù she said. The district board voted Sept. 1 for a vaccination requirement that the district superintendent will draft and implement. The district hasn‚Äôt yet released details of the mandate. As approved by the board, the plan will include a process for requesting accommodations for medical conditions or for sincerely held religious beliefs. Amid talk of a protest against the mandate, the district said Tuesday that staff member absences were about double from the day after Labor Day in 2019. The district said the callouts accounted for less than 5% of the CCSD workforce and noted that staff could have called out for a variety of reasons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A family that lost a nearly 185-year-old barn on their farm that‚Äôs been the backdrop for political events for Republican politicians has sunflowers in the spot for now and recently celebrated a grand reopening. The fire burned down a four-story, 80-foot-long barn at the Scamman Farm in Stratham in May. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so beautiful, and we‚Äôve been getting a lot of phone calls through the summer asking if they can come take photos in the sunflower patch,‚Äù farm manager Sue Fernholz said. ‚ÄúIt shows that there‚Äôs beauty in life after tragedy.‚Äù Fernholz said the sunflowers were planted to pay tribute to the sister of a family friend who died last year. The farm, which reopened last week, also features corn mazes, hayrides, pumpkin patch and other attractions. The family still plans to rebuild the barn once two other buildings are repaired. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to take the winter to figure out what our needs are (for the new barn),‚Äù Kirk Scamman said. Former Presidents George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, had visited the farm. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, launched his campaign there, and Republican Scott Brown announced his U.S. Senate run there in 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFair Lawn: One school district is getting creative with ways to allow students to get mask-free fresh air during the day. The Fair Lawn district has set up 32 tents at its 10 schools for outdoor lunch, and at Fair Lawn High School, two additional tents are available for outdoor classes, said Superintendent Nicholas Norcia. The first day of school last Friday had a delayed start because of flooding, and the schools have been closed this week until Thursday for the Rosh Hashana holiday. The principals will be working with teachers to determine a schedule for outdoor classrooms so that everyone can get a chance to use them, Norcia said. On Friday, Norcia visited a few schools. ‚ÄúThe students were excited to be outside in beautiful weather, eating lunch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey were having the best time ever, and it was so great to see.‚Äù As of now, the schedule will allow for half the students to eat lunch outside while the other half are inside, and they will rotate. While in the tents, students don‚Äôt need to wear masks, Norcia said. Meanwhile, some school districts along the Jersey shore have been lifting mask mandates, citing excessive heat and insufficient air conditioning in classrooms.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expansion of nonmerit scholarships to college and greater spending to safeguard abandoned oil wells in the state are among the governor‚Äôs new spending priorities, amid a windfall in income linked to federal pandemic relief and petroleum production. September marks the outset of the Legislature‚Äôs grueling budget-writing process for the year beginning July 1, 2022. Several executive agencies overseen by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are making the case for expanded services. Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said Tuesday that the inclination is to ‚Äúaim high‚Äù and ‚Äúmake the most of the opportunity we have to finish the work of rebuilding state government services after so many years of forced austerity.‚Äù The Human Services Department is suggesting a $100 million spending increase on Medicaid and related mental health services alone, for total annual general fund spending of $1.26 billion on the program. State income for the coming fiscal year is expected to outpace routine annual spending obligations by $1.4 billion, or 19% of annual general fund spending obligations. That leaves lawmakers more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The remains of two people who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack at the World Trade Center were positively identified this week, as officials continued the difficult and heart-wrenching task of returning victims to their families. The announcement came days before the 20th anniversary of an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people when hijacked commercial jets flew into the twin towers, struck the Pentagon and crashed into a Pennsylvania meadow. ‚ÄúNo matter how much time passes since Sept. 11, 2001, we will never forget, and we pledge to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure all those who were lost can be reunited with their families,‚Äù said Dr. Barbara A. Sampson, the chief medical examiner of the city of New York. Technicians in the medical examiner‚Äôs office have been working for years to match thousands of body fragments recovered from the World Trade Center rubble with known victims but haven‚Äôt been able to extract useable DNA in many cases. The identifications announced Tuesday were the first since October 2019. One set of remains was linked to Dorothy Morgan, of Hempstead, New York, who was a broker for Marsh & McLennan. Officials also matched remains recovered in 2001, 2002 and 2006 to a single victim, whose family asked that his name be withheld.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden approved a request Wednesday for federal funds to be made available to residents of western North Carolina who saw major flooding last month due to Tropical Storm Fred. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper sought the emergency declaration for federal assistance to seven counties nearly two weeks ago. ‚ÄúThis federal disaster declaration will help provide assistance for Western North Carolina communities to rebuild stronger and smarter, and I appreciate the president‚Äôs approval of our request,‚Äù Cooper said in a statement. The storm claimed the lives of six people in Haywood County, caused major damage to more than 200 homes and led to nearly $19 million in estimated damages to public infrastructure. The Cruso community was among those hardest-hit by the flooding. Wednesday‚Äôs approval from Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency frees up money to residents of Buncombe, Haywood and Transylvania counties. State, tribal and eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations also qualify for federal funds on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work performed in the three areas, as well as Avery, Madison, Watauga and Yancey counties.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State health officials took to an internet town hall Tuesday to promote certain treatments for COVID-19 and discourage use of an anti-parasitic medicine. Ivermectin has a limited scope for human treatment, sometimes prescribed for worms, scabies and head lice. It is more popular in veterinary form as a treatment for parasitic infections and infestations in cows and horses. North Dakota health officials say data on ivermectin sickness is limited, and poison control has only documented a couple of such cases. But Dr. Joshua Ranum of West River Regional Medical Center said the stories are out there. ‚ÄúThe ivermectin issue is interesting,‚Äù Ranum said. ‚ÄúWe of course live out in farm and ranch country. I‚Äôve had a lot of people tell me that the cows didn‚Äôt get their full dose of ivermectin because some of it accidentally went down the hatch.‚Äù The veterinary form of ivermectin has high concentrations of the drug because of the high body mass of horses and cows. Adverse effects in humans include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma and death. There are better and safer options, according to Ranum and state Health Department spokesman Kirby Kruger. They pointed to monoclonal antibody drugs, steroids and antivirals like remdesivir.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers plan to unveil their version of a newly drawn map of legislative districts Thursday morning, with a vote planned later in the day on a final version, the state Senate president said. The Ohio Redistricting Commission, charged with drawing a map good for as long as 10 years, missed its Sept. 1 deadline, triggering an extension until the middle of the month. Senate Democrats submitted their proposed map last week. The map to be presented Thursday morning was created by House and Senate Republicans, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. Some of the GOP map is almost identical to the Senate Democrats‚Äô version, he said. The commission will vote on a final version of its proposed map Thursday afternoon, Huffman said. The commission held nine public hearings around the state earlier this month looking for input on a new map, which is meant to end the current gerrymandered maps. Voters approved constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018 that created a new process for drawing both state legislative and congressional district maps this year and set up the independent commission. Creating a 10-year map requires a majority vote of the commission, including both Democrats. Creating a four-year map requires a simple majority without both Democrats.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has removed the only two physicians from the board that oversees the state‚Äôs Medicaid agency, just a week after the board voted 7-1 to delay implementing rules on Stitt‚Äôs plan to privatize some Medicaid services. Dr. Jean Hausheer said Tuesday that both she and Dr. Laura Shamblin, an Oklahoma City pediatrician, were informed Saturday by a staffer in the governor‚Äôs office that they were being removed from the governing board of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Hausheer, an ophthalmologist from Lawton, said neither she nor Shamblin was told why they were being removed, and Stitt spokeswoman Carly Atchison didn‚Äôt immediately respond to questions about his decision. ‚ÄúThe governor has my cellphone number ‚Ä¶ it is kind of odd that he didn‚Äôt contact me himself,‚Äù Hausheer said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to presume it was because of our last board meeting.‚Äù Hausheer and Shamblin were among seven members of the board who voted last week to delay implementing rules on Stitt‚Äôs plan to outsource case management for some Medicaid recipients to private insurance companies. Stitt‚Äôs managed care proposal has faced bipartisan opposition in the Legislature and was ruled unconstitutional in June by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Because of new guidance, city officials may need to exempt the police bureau from an order that all employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk losing their jobs. The city attorney‚Äôs office said Tuesday that the order requiring police to be inoculated is now legally dubious because of new guidance from the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Under state law, local municipalities can only issue vaccine mandates for police officers if a federal or state rule requires it. The city believed Gov. Kate Brown‚Äôs vaccination mandate issued last month for state health care workers covered officers because they receive some medical training. But the new guidance related to Brown‚Äôs vaccine mandate said law enforcement was ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù subject to the governor‚Äôs orders, as providing medical care was ‚Äúlikely not a fundamental part of their job.‚Äù The city‚Äôs police union previously said a vaccine requirement would lead to mass resignations. The Portland Police Bureau has said it does not track vaccination rates for its officers. The city as of Tuesday had not publicly announced any change in policy regarding the vaccination mandate. Multnomah County, like Portland, has ordered all employees to be vaccinated by Oct. 18, including the sheriff‚Äôs office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A statewide mask mandate for schools went into effect Tuesday, with some districts in open defiance of the Wolf administration, while GOP leaders in the state House planned to come back to Harrisburg early to mount a legislative response. The state health secretary‚Äôs order that students, staff and visitors at K-12 schools and child care facilities are required to wear masks while indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, has provoked outrage from some parents, students and school board members who say the decision should remain local. Some districts faced anti-mask protests as students returned to class after the long Labor Day weekend. Meanwhile, the Tamaqua Area School Board in Schuylkill County flouted the mask mandate by voting to keep face coverings optional. The superintendent of Hamburg Area School District in Berks County said masks would remain optional pending the outcome of a special school board meeting to discuss the statewide mandate. Late Tuesday, the board voted 5-3 to adhere to the Department of Health order and require masks, WFMZ reports. In central Pennsylvania, the Central York School Board expressed disdain for the mask mandate and said it would give a ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù for students to come into compliance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Local police organizations are questioning Mayor Jorge O. Elorza‚Äôs judgment after he hired a civilian with no experience in law enforcement to be the city‚Äôs first-ever police major instead of considering the Black officers who applied for the position. Elorza chose Michael Stephens, who has no experience in law enforcement, aside from graduating from the citizens academy in 2016. Stephens was a recreation director and NCAA referee before his appointment as police major, The Boston Globe reports. The National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers Chairman Charles Wilson said the mayor‚Äôs decision in appointing a civilian without experience over qualified Black law enforcement officers was demeaning. Stephens is also Black. Stephens will manage oversight on police training and be responsible for the recruitment and training of police recruits. According to Wilson, three Black officers applied for the major‚Äôs position. The mayor chose Elorza instead. Providence City Council President John Igliozzi proposed that the mayor change the job title from police major to public safety community-police liaison because of the backlash from the police organizations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Authorities shut down a road for more than an hour Tuesday to investigate a bomb threat that turned out to be a wedding dress, Charleston Police said. Someone who saw a woman cram an oversized package into a mailbox called 911, Charleston Police spokesman Charles Francis said in a statement. Officers responded and determined the package contained a wedding dress that a woman was trying to return by mail, Francis said. The road was reopened after more than an hour. The statement did not say if the wedding dress was damaged.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has capped the number of retail stores that can sell medical marijuana at five. The council signed off Tuesday night on a proposal coming from Mayor Paul TenHaken‚Äôs office. But council members halved the $100,000 license fee that City Hall wanted and will allow the licenses to be sold on the secondary market. ‚ÄúThe Sioux Falls City Council, by making a license worth $50,000 and transferrable, has just made dispensary licenses into liquor licenses,‚Äù Drew Duncan, a Sioux Falls attorney and lobbyist for clients in South Dakota‚Äôs gambling and alcohol industry, said via social media following the 7-1 vote. A new liquor license in Sioux Falls costs about $200,000, but a state-set cap on the number of them has driven up the price on the secondary market to $300,000 or higher. TenHaken and supporters of barring the transfer of dispensary licenses worry that allowing them to be sold on the secondary market will give them an artificial value, just as has happened with liquor licenses. But the majority of the council decided without allowing a license to be owned outright, the city‚Äôs medical marijuana rules would unduly restrict a retailer‚Äôs ability to grow their business.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel has approved $65 million in state incentives for Oracle Corp. as the company plans to bring 8,500 jobs and an investment topping $1 billion to the fast-growing capital city over the coming decade. The State Funding Board‚Äôs approval of the FastTrack grant came during a meeting Tuesday. In April, Nashville Mayor John Cooper‚Äôs office announced that the Austin, Texas-based computer technology company plans to build the new campus with 1.2 million square feet of office space. Documents show the jobs will have an average salary of $110,000. Oracle paid $254 million for 60 acres and is offering $175 million upfront for public infrastructure, including a pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River, environmental cleanup, a sewer pump station and a riverfront park, the mayor‚Äôs office has said. Half of Oracle‚Äôs future property taxes ‚Äì which the company estimates will be roughly $18 million annually when the project is fully built ‚Äì would reimburse the company for the upfront investment, without interest payments, with the other half going into the city‚Äôs general operating fund, Cooper‚Äôs office has said. The move would surpass the expansion of Amazon, which in 2018 announced it would bring 5,000 jobs through a $230 million investment.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday defended a new state law banning most abortions that also does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, saying it does not force victims to give birth ‚Äì even though it prohibits abortions before many women know they‚Äôre pregnant. Abbott, a Republican, said Texas would strive to ‚Äúeliminate all rapists from the streets‚Äù while taking questions during his first press conference since the law took effect last week. The comments drew new criticism from opponents of the biggest curb on abortion in the U.S. since the medical procedure was legalized a half-century ago. The Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Though abortion providers in Texas say the law is unconstitutional, they say they are abiding by it. ‚ÄúHis comments are confusing to me because they certainly do not seem to reflect the realities of this law,‚Äù said Amy Jones, the chief executive officer of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. Recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice found that most rapes go unreported to police. ‚ÄúCertainly it is in our mission statement to work to end sexual violence ‚Äì that is why we exist ‚Äì but we are also very aware that that is an aspirational goal that yes, we do believe that this is a preventable crime, but it if it were that easy, rape would no longer exist,‚Äù Jones said.\n\nUtah\n\nBrian Head: In the midst of record tourism statewide, Gov. Spencer Cox helped park staff and charity partners break ground Tuesday on a new visitor center at Cedar Breaks National Monument. The center has been a decade in the making, built with a combined $6 million in funds from fees, donations, and funding from Iron County, the National Park Service, the Zion Forever Project charity and organizations. Superintendent Kathleen Gondor did a ‚Äúhappy dance‚Äù as she opened the groundbreaking ceremony near the popular Point Supreme overlook, which is currently closed to the public because of the construction. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to give us that sense of place instead of a bunch of pullouts along the road,‚Äù she said, echoing a sentiment that Cedar Breaks is a ‚Äúdrive-thru‚Äù park. Cox said there was ‚Äúevery right to be excited,‚Äù and he was glad to see partnerships work as visitation soars in the lesser-known park. ‚ÄúSo many people even in Utah don‚Äôt know about it, still,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAmericans are rediscovering America, and Utahns are rediscovering Utah.‚Äù But with increased visitors comes an increased responsibility to make sure those visitors have a good experience and recreate responsibly, something Cox said he hopes the visitor center will help people to do.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: Three state troopers who are accused of being involved in a scheme to create fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards have resigned, state police said Tuesday. Troopers Shawn Sommers and Raymond Witkowski resigned Aug. 10, a day after a fellow trooper told supervisors about the alleged scheme. Trooper David Pfindel resigned Sept. 3 following further investigation, according to a state police news release. The three ex-troopers are suspected of having varying roles in the making of fraudulent vaccination cards, according to the release. ‚ÄúThe accusations in this case involve an extraordinary level of misconduct ‚Äì a criminal violation of the law ‚Äì and I could not be more upset and disappointed,‚Äù Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in the release. ‚ÄúIf these allegations are proved to be true, it is reprehensible that state troopers would manipulate vaccination cards in the midst of a pandemic, when being vaccinated is one of the most important steps anyone can take to keep their community safe from COVID-19.‚Äù Sommers and Witkowski both joined the Vermont State Police in July 2016. Pfindel was hired in January 2014, police said. Federal authorities are investigating the allegations.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A part of southside Virginia that has relatively lower rates of vaccination against COVID-19 is seeing increasing interest in the shots. The Danville Register & Bee reports that it appears the most recent surge in infections has spurred more residents to roll up their sleeves in the Pittsylvania-Danville Health District. Data from the Virginia Department of Health shows that inoculations jumped about 50% in August compared to July. Nearly two-thirds of the almost 5,700 shots were first doses. ‚ÄúNumbers of vaccinations are increasing as of late, which we welcome and consider a positive step by the community,‚Äù Dr. Scott Spillmann, director of the local health district, told the newspaper. ‚ÄúWe ask everyone who is not yet fully vaccinated to do so as soon as possible.‚Äù Southside Virginia trails the rest of the state when it comes to vaccination rates. As of Friday, 51% of adults in Danville were fully inoculated. In Pittsylvania County, 47% of adults were fully vaccinated. Statewide, more than two-thirds of adults have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series. Meanwhile, Danville and Pittsylvania County combined are seeing about 52 new coronavirus infections a day because of the delta variant.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: A recent increase in COVID-19 deaths has overwhelmed a southwest Washington county‚Äôs storage capacity, prompting the coroner to ask the commissioners to declare an emergency to allow the county to bring in a refrigeration trailer. Cowlitz County commissioners agreed Tuesday to the request to help expand capacity until the new morgue is ready for staff to move into in about a month. The Daily News reports Cowlitz County Health and Human Services data for the past week is incomplete, but at least eight county residents died due to COVID-19 between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6. The residents ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and seven of the residents had been hospitalized. Coroner Tim Davidson said the morgue and the county‚Äôs funeral homes are maxed out on capacity, and they are ‚Äúbeing creative‚Äù to maintain cold storage. All together, the facilities can typically hold 45 bodies and right now have about 65, he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just doing our best that we can to preserve the dignity of the deceased from this point forward until they can be processed for their families,‚Äù Davidson said. The morgue can hold 10 bodies but is currently ‚Äúway above that,‚Äù using gurney tables in the cooling rooms to handle the increase, he said. The new morgue under construction will be able to hold 50 in cold storage.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: The state‚Äôs largest annual festival will require most people in attendance to wear masks when Bridge Day is held this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic in America‚Äôs newest national park. Tens of thousands of people typically show up on the third Saturday of October to watch parachutists, zip liners and rappellers on the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville. Masks will be required at the festival regardless of vaccination status, and social distancing must be observed whenever possible, the Bridge Day Commission said in a statement. People come from across the world to attend the event. Festivalgoers typically line the center of the 3,000-foot-long bridge shoulder-to-shoulder trying to get a good look at parachutists catapulting themselves off the nation‚Äôs third-highest bridge. Exceptions to the mask mandate include those at the time of their participation ‚Äì be it in the air, during a 5-kilometer run, while rafting in the New River or on a zip line. But they‚Äôll have to mask up before and after, the statement said. Social distancing will be next to impossible on the crowded bridge itself, but organizers said it will be required on the festival‚Äôs perimeters. Bridge Day is the only day of the year the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. The pandemic forced last year‚Äôs event to be canceled.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A new report suggests people are buying dramatically more alcohol as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. Revenue from state excise taxes on alcohol during the fiscal year that ended June 30 totaled $73.8 million, up almost 17% from $63.3 million the previous year, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Revenue cited in the report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. If the preliminary data holds, the increase would be the biggest proportional increase the state has seen since 1972, the report said. The rise in alcohol tax collection exceeded 2.4% in only one year between 2009 and 2020, the report said. Alcohol excise taxes in Wisconsin are based on the volume sold, not price. Beer is taxed at about 6.5 cents per gallon. Wine is taxed at 25 cents per gallon if it has an alcohol content of 14% or less. The report did not examine sales tax revenue on alcohol. Most states have seen a bump in alcohol tax revenues during fiscal year 2021. The report said increased alcohol consumption is ‚Äúperhaps unsurprising‚Äù given rising stress related to personal health, job losses, school challenges and a lack of leisure activities during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Michael K. Davis plans to retire in January, opening the way for Gov. Mark Gordon to make his first appointment to the high court. Davis plans to retire Jan. 16 after a decade on the state‚Äôs highest court, Chief Justice Kate M. Fox said in a statement Tuesday. Davis served as chief justice for three years, stepping down from that role July 1. He was a state district judge for four years before being named to the Supreme Court. He previously was an attorney in private practice. He graduated with honors from the University of Wyoming law school in 1980. Former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican, named all five current justices over his two terms in office. Gordon, also a Republican, will choose the next justice from a list of three names submitted to him by the state Judicial Nominating Commission. The commission plans to accept expressions of interest from qualified people through Oct. 1. Wyoming requires Supreme Court justices to be at least 30, ‚Äúlearned in the law,‚Äù a judge or attorney for at least nine years, a U.S. citizen and a Wyoming resident for at least three years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}]}

Mayor meets with community on solutions", "text": "The brazen killing of a 14-year-old boy during the early evening hours Tuesday followed by a series of shootings in the days that followed prompted Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki to meet with area residents Friday to discuss ways to combat the surge in gun violence.\n\nDespite only one of the 21 people shot so far this month in Wilmington occurring in the northeastern section of the city, Purzycki and other officials gathered with residents of the city‚Äôs 1st District to discuss ways to tackle the spike.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of roughly 150 people ‚Äì including children, religious and community leaders, elected officials and residents from throughout the city ‚Äì Purzycki said that the shooting of 14-year-old Christopher Smith while riding his bike was particularly poignant, but the discussion Friday extended to all the shootings in Wilmington.\n\n\"We are never going to rid the world of violence, but if we can do the basics, we can make a much safer city but it‚Äôs not just up to me and the chief and the people who work for me, it‚Äôs up to all of us,\" Purzycki said after outlining some of the steps the city is taking to address the root causes of the violence.\n\nThose steps, the mayor said, include regular street cleaning across the city, stronger code enforcement to improve building conditions for renters, upgrading to LED lighting with the capability to add surveillance cameras, and using the majority of the $55 million slated for Wilmington from the American Rescue Plan to improve neighborhoods.\n\nPurzycki also stressed that the community can put pressure on state lawmakers to change gun laws, suggesting that Delaware doesn't need an open carry law.\n\n\"We do not have to be an open carry state,\" he said, remarking that it creates a culture that glorifies guns. \"We don‚Äôt have to be Wyoming.\"\n\nThe crowd gathered outside the pool house at P.S. du Pont Middle School on West 34th Street, less than a block away from where Smith was gunned down Tuesday evening while hanging out with a friend near Riverview Cemetery.\n\nAt times, emotions ran high during the roughly hour-long discussion, with some attendees expressing frustration with Purzycki's focus on improving housing quality and overall living conditions for the city's poorer residents.\n\n\"I came here today thinking you were going to talk about gun violence, not about your financial plans,\" one attendee said after Purzycki finished his opening remarks. \"I‚Äôm not worried about L&I and I‚Äôm not worried about picking up no damn trash. I‚Äôm worried about young kids not being shot. What are you going to do about that Mr. Mayor?\"\n\nWith another week left in June, Delaware‚Äôs largest city has seen 21 people shot, the most in a single month since September when 23 people were shot. This brings the tally of people shot in Wilmington this year to 73, 14 fatally, the most people shot this early in the year since 2017, the city‚Äôs record year for shootings and homicides.\n\nYOUNG TEEN KILLED:14-year-old boy killed in Wilmington shooting Tuesday\n\nVIOLENT CRIME SPIKES:Shootings plague Wilmington hours after 24-year-old man shot in busy park\n\nMORE SHOOTINGS:Teen shot in Wilmington's Hilltop neighborhood\n\nShootings across the country have become more brash, with violent incidents occurring in the afternoon and early evening hours rather than late at night under the cover of darkness.\n\nMore than half of all incidents statewide occurred between 5:00 p.m. and midnight, according to a Delaware Criminal Justice Council Statistical Analysis Center report on shootings in 2019. Wilmington accounted for 57 percent of shooting incidents statewide occurring between 6 a.m. and midnight, with 19 occurring between noon and 5 p.m., 27 shooting incidents each happened between 5 and 9 p.m. and 9 p.m. to midnight, according to the report.\n\nThe fact that the latest shootings in Wilmington occurred during daylight hours in parks and other places where large crowds gather further stress this trend ‚Äì one that city officials say requires the community‚Äôs help to address.\n\nCity officials say shooters no longer care if they are seen, expecting witnesses to remain mum for fear of retaliation. Few people come forward to help capture suspects and secure justice for the victims and their families.\n\n\"It‚Äôs as if the perpetrators of the crimes are not afraid that anybody is going to call them out,\" Purzycki said. \"This is not a police issue. This is society‚Äôs problem. We‚Äôve screwed this up fairly well, and somehow we have to figure out how to solve it.\"\n\nWilmington activist the Rev. Derrick ‚ÄúPastor D‚Äù Johnson called on the mayor to include people who have developed a rapport with residents in discussions of solutions, remarking that those who are considered \"community partners\" aren't the ones who are on the street interacting with the community.\n\nJohnson stressed that Wilmington officials need to focus on the culture that attracts youth to gang life and eliminate the political back-and-forth that holds back progress. Purzycki pledged to call Johnson on Monday to work together toward a solution.\n\nThose attracted to gang life are looking to feel significant and important, Johnson said.\n\n\"The streets tell them they are significant, and murder tells them they matter,\" he said.\n\nContact Amanda Fries at afries@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2014/07/20/reports-shooting-haynes-park-wilmington/12919467/", "title": "Shots halt event at Haynes Park in Wilmington", "text": "Sean O'Sullivan\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON ‚Äì Shots interrupted a charity basketball tournament Sunday evening at Haynes Park, according to police.\n\nIt appears no one was wounded in the chaotic situation, Cpl.

His condition was not available, but he was described as stable.\n\nThe place where police say evidence of his shooting was found is not part of the Riverfront area, but west of I-95 where residential Marshall Street comes to a T at Oak Street.\n\nPolice have not said how the shooting victim arrived at the movie theater or why he was there instead of seeking medical attention.\n\nThe situation echoed a shooting on Nov. 30, 2013, when an injured Philadelphia man told police he was shot at the Riverfront.\n\nThe 33-year-old was driving near West Fourth and North Van Buren streets shortly after 2:30 a.m. when he flagged down a city officer. He said he was standing outside the Chase Center, heard gunfire, realized he was hit in the arm and was trying to find a hospital, police said. The officer escorted him to Wilmington Hospital, where he was treated for the minor injury and released, they said.\n\nResidents, business people and visitors were shocked by what was labeled as the first gun violence at the Riverfront, a relatively safe area where tens of millions of dollars have been poured over many years into housing and business development.\n\nWeeks later, there was relief on the Riverfront.\n\nThe taxpayer-supported Riverfront Development Corp. announced it had conducted an unprecedented independent investigation of the incident, concluding there was no evidence the shooting occurred at the Riverfront, calling the area an ‚Äúextremely safe destination for shopping and recreation.‚Äù\n\nFollowing the RDC announcement, Wilmington Police Department also issued a statement saying its own investigation also found no evidence of the shooting having occurred at the Riverfront ‚Äì and concluded the injured man had lied.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a duty to thoroughly investigate any alleged shooting incident, and lacking any physical evidence, our starting point is where the victim claims the incident occurred,‚Äù then-police spokesman Cpl. Mark Ivey said.\n\nPolice, who routinely report victim accounts of shootings‚Äô circumstances, also revealed a search warrant executed on the Philadelphia man‚Äôs vehicle turned up $116,000 in cash.\n\nBy that time, however, news of the alleged Riverfront shooting had alarmed Wilmington residents, leadership and business leaders, especially coming as the city struggled with a year of record gun violence.\n\nBetween the initial report of the Philadelphia man‚Äôs shooting and the time his account of where it happened was labeled a lie, Wilmington City Council voted unanimously to urge the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù of gun violence in the city.\n\nThe injured Philadelphian was the 147th person shot in the city that year.\n\nEmphasizing that the city‚Äôs Riverfront is a safe area, RDC Executive Director Michael S. Purzycki said at the time, ‚ÄúWe are absolutely committed to making sure it stays that way.‚Äù\n\nTuesday night‚Äôs shooting victim was the 60th person injured in gunfire in the city this year, including 14 who were killed.\n\nPolice ask anyone with information about the shooting to call Detective Michael Gifford at (302) 576-3640. Information also may be given by calling the Wilmington Police Confidential Tip Line at (302) 576-3990 or sent in texts starting with TIP WILMINGTON to 888777.\n\nContact robin brown at (302) 324-2856 or rbrown@delawareonline.com.

The combination of a quick-loading, high-powered weapon and extra ammunition is the reason so many shootings have multiple bullets fired ‚Äì and unintended victims in densely populated neighborhoods are being killed.\n\nWilmington police Chief Bobby Cummings said even novice shooters with such a gun can wield incredible firepower, able to scattershot rounds in a wide path. Some shooting scenes are littered with dozens of bullet holes and shell casings, which Forensic Services Unit investigators mark with orange cones or chalk circles as evidence to be tested.\n\n‚ÄúObviously, the extended magazines are creating a significant threat, not only to the intended target, but people who may be in the general area at the time of a shooting incident,‚Äù Cummings said.\n\nMore than 20 casings, for example, were found in the 400 block of North Monroe Street after an Oct. 14 shooting that killed a man in the crossfire. It was one of 20 shootings citywide during the month.\n\nIn another case about three weeks later, police found 21 bullets pumped into a white Honda near a Southbridge bar, one of 11 shootings for November.\n\nWilmington ranks third in violence among 450 cities of its size, according to FBI, and has averaged 118 shooting victims each year for the past decade. Last year, there were 127.\n\nThe sound of multiple gunshots are a regular occurrence in places like the West Center City neighborhood, where residents compare scenes to something out of the ‚Äúwild, wild west.‚Äù\n\nBrooke Allison, who moved her family out of West Center City two years ago after the spike in violence, said she's seen the way bullets take apart a family and a home. Her mother's back patio door was shattered in a shooting earlier this year and bullet holes still dot the wooden fence behind her house.\n\n‚ÄúI used to hear bullets all the time ... one hit my screen door and I would be ducking to cover my kids,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, my kids are going, ‚ÄòOh there's a shooting ... and running to see the action.‚Äô Gunshots don't mean anything to these kids nowadays. They run to the scene and pull out their phones.‚Äù\n\nA study released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was asked to study Wilmington crime by City Councilwoman Hanifa Shabazz, pointed to ‚Äúepidemic levels of urban gun violence‚Äù in the community. Last year, Wilmington ranked third among 450 cities of comparable size for most violent crimes behind Saginaw and Flint in Michigan, according to the FBI.\n\nThe state General Assembly and Gov. Jack Markell last year also established a special panel, the Wilmington Public Safety Strategies Commission, to make recommendations to the city and Police Department for combating crime, including better tracking firearms.\n\nMayor Dennis P. Williams has been criticized for not implementing all the suggestions, most recently on Tuesday in a letter by Assembly members who represent Wilmington in Dover.\n\nSo far, 123 shootings have happened this year in Wilmington . The city is on track to have the deadliest 12 months since 2013, with 141 victims and 24 killed.\n\nOne of the 2015 victims was Shurkri Brown, 32, whose arms, chest and face were hit by nine bullets, during a shooting near West Seventh and North West streets on April 3. A father of six, he still battles intense pain, depression and nightmares of the violence he endured.\n\n‚ÄúI still relive it,‚Äù he said.\n\nScars map his body ‚Äì‚Äì reminders of bullets that tore through his skin, one just centimeters above his heart. Brown was in a coma for three days and hospitalized for weeks after the shooting. Even though Brown had prior experience with guns and knew plenty of people who had been shot, he couldn't imagine being hit nine times.\n\n\"I never had beef in the hood,\" Brown said. \"I could go anywhere. But I guess he wanted to get me before I got him, even thought I wasn't trying to get him.\"\n\nWilmington police would not disclose what type of weapons are most commonly used in crimes, but Cummings and other officials said semi-automatic pistols with extended magazines are a favorite of criminals. In Philadelphia, for example, 65 percent of firearms recovered last year were semi-automatics, said Philadelphia police Department Officer Leeloni Palmiero.\n\nThe appeal is that semi-automatics are simple to use and relatively easy to obtain.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the gangster gun,‚Äù said Jeremy Moore, who works at Starquest Shooters & Survival Supplies in Brandywine Hundred, as he held a Glock 19 semi-automatic, a black model weighing about 1.8 pounds when loaded with the standard 15 rounds.\n\nHe said the gun is the most popular in America ‚Äî light, easily concealable and straightforward to operate. The magazine holding the ammo has a spring that pops a new round into the firing chamber each time the trigger is squeezed. The bullet explodes from the barrel while a casing is expelled out the top of the weapon.\n\nEven a shooter without much skill can unload all 15 bullets in less than 30 seconds, Moore said. Add an extended magazine, and the semi-automatic‚Äôs capacity can grow to 30 rounds.\n\nOnce emptied, a magazine ‚Äî also known as a \"ladder\" ‚Äî can easily be replaced with another fully loaded.\n\nUnlike fully automatic weapons, which can fire a continuous stream of bullets and are illegal in Delaware, a semi-automatic discharges only when the trigger is pulled. But Cummings said the addition of the high-capacity magazines are being used by criminals to beef up semi-automatics to make them more like assault weapons.\n\n\"They can't get the weapons that can get them the firepower,\" he said, \"so they're grabbing ladders instead.\"\n\nBy contrast, the weapon most commonly traced to criminal acts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2000 ‚Äì the .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver ‚Äì has a capacity of eight rounds.\n\nThe ATF has not conducted a similar national study on specific firearms since then, but the agency has tallied gun types tied to crimes in each state. In Delaware, pistols are overwhelmingly the top spot, with 522 recovered in 2014, compared to 187 revolvers.\n\nThe one constant is that the weapons are getting more and more powerful, especially with the addition of the detachable magazines, police said.\n\nPolice and gun sellers say the vast majority of firearm purchases are legal. Delaware also requires background checks for private parties selling or transferring firearms.\n\nCriminals typically secure firearms through \"straw purchases,\" in which a third-party person is paid to buy a gun. He or she passes the background check and makes the purchase legally, only to hand it over to the criminal.\n\nA basic semi-automatic pistol retails for about $150, a price Moore speculated is a factor in their popularity with criminals.\n\n‚ÄúGuys don‚Äôt want to buy something expensive because they‚Äôre going to buy it, shoot someone with it and get rid of it,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe Crime Commission report, which examined the gun trade in Wilmington, said ‚Äúthat most, if not all, of the firearms are the result of straw purchases.‚Äù The report said buyers can be a ‚Äúsingle mother or drug addict who purchases the firearms for shooters in exchange for money, narcotics, or both.‚Äù\n\nSome guns come from break-ins, said Wilmington police Sgt. Andrea Janvier.\n\n‚ÄúThey get them a lot of ways, whether it be through robbing a home where they‚Äôre stored or through straw purchases,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey do what they need to do to get their guns.‚Äù\n\nMost of Delaware's guns were traced back to the First State purchases, though many were also linked to Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. ATF data shows some came from as far as Texas and Florida.\n\nRon Palimere, owner of the Starquest gun store, said his employees see about one attempted straw purchase a month. Often a woman accompanied by a man will try to purchase a cheap gun. Employees suspecting this often offer alternatives to the buyer, as well as note the ramifications ‚Äî and 10-year jail sentence ‚Äî they may face if their purchased gun is used in a crime.\n\n‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt feel comfortable with a sale, we don‚Äôt have a give a reason why we deny the purchase,‚Äù he said, adding that the ATF supports gun shop owners in their decisions. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre essentially the last line of defense before people get their hands on guns.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt affects me, too,‚Äù Palimere said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the bad guys running around with guns, either.‚Äù\n\nDelaware has no laws regulating large-capacity ammunition magazines, though anti-gun activists are pushing to ban the arms. A 2013 bill to prohibit the sales failed in the General Assembly.\n\nNine states prohibit or severely limit the use and possession of extended magazines, which generally are considered anything more than 15 bullets.\n\nLos Angeles also banned the extended magazines in July, following a sharp increase in gun crime. The law went into effect in November, and the L.A. Police Department doesn‚Äôt have data yet to indicate the impact on the number of shootings.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from gun owners who challenged a ban on semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines in Highland Park, Illinois, near Chicago.\n\nCalls for more stringent gun control rules also recently spread in the aftermath of the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting that left 14 dead.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in a televised speech Dec. 6 said, ‚ÄúI know there are some who reject any gun safety measures. But the fact is that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies ‚Äî no matter how effective they are ‚Äî cannot identify every would-be mass shooter.\"\n\nObama previously called for tighter gun control laws in light of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December 2012 that killed 26.\n\nRobert J. Cottrol, a George Washington University law professor and gun expert, has studied semi-automatic weapons and said they‚Äôre far more of a threat than rifles and other guns used in mass shootings.\n\n\"For all gun crimes, we are really talking about pistols rather than rifles of one sort or another,\" Cottrol said. \"Obviously, you get the spectacular mass shooting occurring with rifles. But my reading of the statistics is something in the order of 100 people a year are killed, in those events as opposed to 10,000-15,000 homicides a year (by pistols), depending on the year.\"\n\nHe said criminals prefer semi-automatic pistols because they get the effectiveness and ability to conceal the hardware ‚Äì the same reason people carry them for self-defense.\n\nThe popularity, however, does not mean the criminals getting the guns understand the power, said Master Cpl. Mark Hoffman, of the Dover Police Department, which also is grappling with violence. The city has had 18 shootings this year, seven of which were fatal.\n\n\"We're seeing people who don't know how terminal gunfire is,\" he said.\n\nAdditional rounds fired mean more evidence for law enforcement to use for tracing weapons and linking crimes. Wilmington police scan shell casings using Match Point technology, an ottoman-sized black box in the evidence control room.\n\nThe machine analyzes and matches shell casings to others entered into a nation-wide database. When a shell casing is tied to another case, police can use that as evidence and link it to other crimes.\n\nPolice hope the machine will help determine whether four semi-automatics found in a white BMW following a high-speed car chase through the city on Nov. 3 were involved in other shootings around the city. Officials are awaiting results from the firearms examiner in Dover.\n\nA MasterPiece Arms .45 Automatic Colt Pistol with an extended magazine sat next to the car's driver, Willie Brothers Jr., in plain view and within easy reach, police said. It was able to spit out nearly a round a second with a skilled shooter.\n\nBrothers was charged in connection with a shooting on Oct. 29 along Jensen Drive, as well as a slew of other charges.\n\nPolice put out an alert earlier in the evening about the vehicle, adding that the vehicle and its probable driver were wanted in connection to multiple shootings in the city. Two Smith and Wesson .40 caliber handguns and a .45 caliber Sig Sauer 1911 were also found in the car, as well as .45 caliber, .40 caliber and .380 caliber ammunition.\n\nWilmington police won‚Äôt get into the details of how they analyze shell casings because they don‚Äôt want shooters to know what they do.\n\nThe Police Department in 2014 recorded 363 firearm recoveries, the most in Delaware, followed by Newark at 118 and Dover at 76, according to the ATF.\n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams and Cummings have said the Police Department is aggressively working to address crime and build better relationships with the community.\n\nLast month was the first November in five years in which no one died of gun violence. The month had 11 shootings, down from a record 21 from November 2014.\n\nCummings also said police staff are equipped to handle the high-capacity weapons. While officers carry a standard-issue Smith and Wesson .40 caliber pistol with 15 rounds, members of the city's SWAT team have much more powerful weapons at their disposal in a moment‚Äôs notice, Cummings said.\n\n\"I‚Äôm not going to say that we are evenly matched, but we still have the ability to do our jobs,\" he said.\n\nThe CDC report released last month also recommended increasing collaboration between schools, hospitals and courts and sharing data in a risk assessment tool, ultimately used to determine how at-risk a child may be to commit violence, as well as wrap-around services combining mental health, mentoring, counseling and more.\n\nData shows the majority of shootings involve younger people, often between the ages of 13 and 17, in arguments that escalate from social media to physical altercations, according to the commission's report. Many locals note that instead of fighting with their fists, young people turn to guns.\n\nCummings said authorities aren‚Äôt backing down from seizing firearms and stopping violence, and are working with other agencies. So far this year, the Police Department has gotten 241 guns through patrols and investigations, 42 of which came from West Center City.\n\nBut there is plenty more work to do, he said.\n\n\"We are taking guns off the streets every day, and we are not the only ones,‚Äù Cummings said, ‚Äúso there have to be a lot of them out there.‚Äù\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Police made arrests in three others but none of them involved a gun.\n\nShootings remain the most difficult to solve.\n\nIn Berry-Shivers' death, because of the video, detectives were able to search social media and found Fletcher-Hargrow's picture through associates in previous investigations, court documents said.\n\nFingerprints on a car he touched in the video matched Fletcher-Hargrow's prints, according to court documents.\n\nState and federal agents arrested him on June 13 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe families of victims in 11 other shooting deaths this year have yet to see that kind of closure.\n\nSome other 2018 homicides have pending indictments, said a Wilmington police spokesman. That means suspects are identified, but not charged.\n\nDover police made arrests in all three of its 2018 homicide cases. New Castle County Police made arrests in or otherwise solved four of its six 2018 homicide incidents. Middletown police had one homicide this year and have made an arrest. State police made arrests or otherwise solved 86 percent of its seven 2018 homicide incidents.\n\nSome homicide incidents had more than one victim, such as the two double shootings New Castle County Police have yet to solve. Others, such as any of the three murder-suicides committed in Delaware this year, don't require arrests for police to solve them.\n\nOnly three of this year's 18 homicide events outside Wilmington don't have a suspect in custody. Wilmington police made arrests in four of its 14 homicide events, 10 of which are shooting deaths.\n\n\"Wilmington is, unfortunately, a good place to commit murder,\" said Thomas Hargrove, founder of the Murder Accountability Project. \"You're probably going to get away with it.\"\n\nHargrove was looking at Wilmington data reported to the FBI from 2012 to 2016. The Project is designed to track unsolved killings nationwide and make murder data public.\n\n\"In 58 percent, the killer walked,\" Hargrove said of Wilmington's 2012-16 clearance rate. \"That's not good. When that happens, you should expect the murder rate to rise.\"\n\nIt did.\n\nLast year was the worst on record for Wilmington gun violence ‚Äî 197 shot, 32 fatally.\n\nThen the fever broke.\n\nShootings declined this year over last by 55 percent, according to Wilmington police data up to July 29. By that date last year, 103 people had been shot. This year, it was 46.\n\nMurders reported by the department by July 29 fell from 21 last year to 15 this year.\n\n\"If the murder rate is down this year, that might suggest Wilmington police have done something important,\" Hargrove said. \"It's possible that they've turned a corner.\"\n\nWILMINGTON POLICING\n\nAs Wilmington crime stats fall, some feel it, some don't\n\nAside from the Fletcher-Hargrow arrest, Wilmington police this year cleared three other homicides, none of which involved guns.\n\nA suspect was still on the scene when police arrived for a stabbing that injured several and killed one. In another stabbing, police followed a trail of blood to the suspect. Police also charged two adults with beating a 15-month-old to death in February.\n\nThough there were fewer shooting deaths this year, solving them still is a challenge.\n\nWilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy has said efforts to keep officers more closely tied to their neighborhood beats is working, but he hasn't declared the mission complete.\n\nHe's said ending the killings will take a long time. He's said the community doesn't speak up when it doesn't trust police to solve crimes or keep its witnesses safe.\n\nCol. Vaughn Bond, who leads New Castle County Police, said silence leaves families without justice, as he says it has for his agency's two unsolved 2018 homicide cases.\n\nNEW CASTLE COUNTY\n\nBond angry about Belvedere double homicide\n\n\"There is a certain segment of the community determined they are not going to work with police,\" Bond said. \"It's not about, necessarily, the police department. This is about providing answers to people who have lost their loved ones.\"\n\nCounty police have six homicide incidents on the books so far this year.\n\nTwo were domestic killings, according to police. There was a murder-suicide on Aug. 7 in which the suspected killer is, obviously, dead. And there's a May 5 case in which police believe a man stabbed his girlfriend, leaving identifying evidence at the scene.\n\nIn another case, a homeowner shot a man police believe was in his house intending to burglarize it. The homeowner was not charged with a crime.\n\nThe March shooting in Ogletown that killed William Laws has four suspects in custody.\n\nNo one has been arrested for the May 24 gunfire killings of Thessalonians Berry and Isabel Cooper on Kiamensi Road or the June 24 shooting deaths of Vincent DiMenco and 15-year-old Doris Dorsey, who died in front of her own house in Belvedere.\n\nBond says there are people of interest in the case, but still wants people to speak up.\n\nSolving gun crimes is difficult, Bond said, especially in gangland-style killings where a shooter may leave little evidence and fades into a crowd of possible suspects.\n\n\"You may get lucky and get some DNA, but many times you don't,\" Bond said. \"Oftentimes, you have to rely on your investigation, and your investigation is going to rely on you being able to canvas an area to come up with witnesses to the incident.\"\n\nThere have been 31 homicide incidents statewide this year, some of which have more than one victim. Thirteen, all of which are shootings, don't have a suspect in custody.\n\nTen of them are in Wilmington. Two are double murders under New Castle County Police jurisdiction. And state police have one from July 6 in which they're trying to identify three people they believe were involved in shooting a man to death in Laurel.\n\nMurder clearance rates are on the decline nationwide. The national murder clearance rate fell to 59.4 percent in 2016, the lowest since the FBI started tracking it.\n\nHargrove said clearance rates are falling largely because of limited police resources.\n\n\"By resources, I mean people, I mean technology, I mean laboratory capacity, I mean time for prosecutors to prosecute,\" Hargrove said. \"Most of the time when you see a declining clearance rate it is a direct function of the fiscal health of the government.\"\n\nHe pointed to money crises in Illinois, with the country's lowest clearance rate, and in New Jersey, where police departments have shrunk and clearance rates have tumbled.\n\nHe said the average homicide victim is now a black man in an urban area, a setting where Hargrove said community police is required to make up for past failures.\n\n\"A police department that is on a first-name basis with the gangs, has regular communication with the gangs, are very much aware of who the leaders are and who the killers are within the groups, these are police departments that do a much better job of containing murder,\" Hargrove said.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 319-1855 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com\n\nUnsolved 2018 homicides\n\nWilmington Police Department:\n\nSean Spencer - shot in the 800 block of W.
