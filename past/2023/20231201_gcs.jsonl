The money went to the Los Angeles-based Catamaran Consulting LLC, which the group has also contracted with in previous election cycles, and is marked in opposition to Trump.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a billionaire-financed network with an active chapter in Iowa, through its super PAC spent almost $87,000 here in recent weeks on \"message research\" against both President Joe Biden and Trump, according to a separate filing.\n\nThe payments mark the first major spending in Iowa this cycle from the groups, which are among the heaviest Republican spenders in the country and have indicated their opposition to Trump in 2024. Both groups combined to spend almost $140 million in the 2022 midterms.\n\nMore:GOP presidential candidates roast Biden & 'woke' left but not Trump at Iowa Roast and Ride\n\nIf the two organizations choose to continue investing in Iowa, it could mean significant resources dedicated to chipping away support for Trump, who remains the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.\n\n“We’re getting involved earlier than ever in the presidential primary process — and that all begins right here in Iowa,\" said Drew Klein, adviser to the campaign arm of Americans for Prosperity's Iowa chapter.\n\nAFP has for several weeks been running ads targeted at \"key voters throughout the state,\" he said, with the message that \"Donald Trump cannot win a general election, and America can't afford four more years of Joe Biden.\"\n\nKlein said the ads were \"part of AFP Action’s commitment to support a candidate in the Republican presidential primary who can lead our country forward, and who can win.”\n\nClub for Growth did not respond to a request for comment. The groups have not endorsed in the Republican presidential primary.\n\nClub for Growth, which was established as an anti-tax group based out of Washington, D.C., was largely aligned with Trump during his time in office.\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nBut since his 2020 defeat, it has clashed with the former president in proxy battles, including U.S. Senate primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania (Trump's endorsed candidates won both primaries), and now appears prepared to try and stop him from securing the Republican nomination for 2024.\n\nThe Club for Growth president and Trump, once close allies, were not speaking after their 2022 collision course, The Washington Post reported last year. The group released a TV advertisement in May attacking Trump and Biden over Social Security, airing it alongside a LIV golf event played at Trump's course.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, one of several entities founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is based in Virginia and describes itself as a grassroots organization that prioritizes limited government and free markets. It has 36 state chapters, including one in Iowa, which has already begun to knock on doors ahead of the 2024 caucuses.\n\nIn 2022, the group focused its efforts and dollars on electing a slate of Republican U.S. Senate candidates across the country. It has pledged to back an alternative to Trump as the nominee in 2024.\n\n\"The American people have shown that they’re ready to move on, and so AFP will help them do that,\" the group's CEO wrote in an internal memo in February.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers politics for the Register.

Moore\n\nUSAToday\n\nIt didn't take long for Jeb Bush to find out what he'll be debating with his fellow Republicans if he runs for president in 2016.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Bush announced he will \"actively explore\" a presidential bid, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — also a potential candidate — shot back with a one-line online ad from RandPAC, his political action committee: \"We need leaders who will stand against Common Core,'' the ad said.\n\nThe quick response shows how controversy over educational standards that have their roots in the education policy of President George W. Bush could affect a campaign by his younger brother.\n\nThe GOP's bumper crop of potential presidential candidates is split on the Common Core, a set of academic guidelines introduced in 2010 by the National Governors Association and adopted by 46 states. Since leaving the Florida governorship in 2007, Bush has spent much of his time advocating for education reform, including Common Core and school choice. He created the Foundation for Excellence in Education as a vehicle for the cause.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie supports the standards, as do mainstream Republican-leaning groups including the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which see educational improvement as a necessity for American competitiveness.\n\nBut the Common Core standards have become a target of opposition among conservatives, who see them as unwarranted federal intrusion into state and local control of education. Opponents have dubbed the standards \"Obamacore.''\n\nTo the conservative wing of the GOP, Common Core is anathema. Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all oppose the standards. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called for repeal of the standards during his re-election campaign this year. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed legislation opting out of the standards in in March. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, also considering a presidential campaign, has sued the Obama administration for allegedly coercing states into adopting the standards.\n\nIn Iowa, where the first presidential primary contest is held, GOP activists \"see it as a complete loss of control,'' says Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa conservative. \"They believe it is a complete government takeover of the education system.\"\n\nThat position is shared by Americans for Prosperity, the political action group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch. \"We oppose expanded federal interference in education,'' says AFP spokesman Levi Russell. \"Our activists are interested in hearing directly from potential candidates on the positions they support, and will be evaluating them based on those issues.\"\n\nBush can emphasize his support for school choice, which unlike Common Core is popular among conservatives, says Craig Robinson, former political director for the Iowa GOP. \"He has a record that would appeal to a lot of Iowans on education. He's put together policies that expand educational choice and at the end of the road, that's what a lot of Iowans want.\"\n\nCommon Core standards resulted in part from fears that testing under No Child Left Behind — George W. Bush's signature education overhaul — had encouraged states to lower their standards to more easily meet NCLB progress goals. When the Obama administration offered Race to the Top grant money as an incentive to adopt Common Core standards, states leaped to do so.\n\nMany are now having second thoughts. Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Carolina and South Carolina have all dropped Common Core standards after initially adopting them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures — though Missouri, North and South Carolina are still using the standards while they develop alternatives. Alaska, Nebraska, Texas and Virginia never adopted the standards.\n\nControversy began to grow last year, when schools actually began teaching curricula aligned with the Common Core, says Mike McShane of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \"Kids for the first time were starting to come home and say, 'We've got these new math lessons and my teacher says it's because we're doing the Common Core,' '' McShane says. \"That's when it hit Facebook.''\n\nIn 2014 there were 77 bills introduced in state legislatures to limit or halt implementation of Common Core — with more expected next year — including in Iowa and New Hampshire. When the GOP candidates show up in earnest for the first nominating contests of 2016, they will be stepping into the battleground where state-level fight may turn into a presidential one.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/07/koch-group-turns-up-heat-on-gop/1972449/", "title": "Koch group turns up heat on GOP state lawmakers", "text": "Chris Sikich, The Indianapolis Star\n\nGroup plans aggressive media campaign to back Indiana governor%27s tax cut proposal\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been lukewarm to the plan\n\nGroup founded by the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Gov. Mike Pence will get a little help from his conservative friends to push his tax cut through the Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly.\n\nSo far, the proposed 10 percent cut to individual income taxes has received a lukewarm reception from Pence's fellow Republicans in the legislature. But the conservative Americans for Prosperity group announced Thursday it will launch an aggressive media campaign to back the governor -- and browbeat reluctant GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe national group was founded by the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas and is known for opposing President Barack Obama and some of his programs. But Thursday, group President Tim Phillips said the organization and its 32 local chapters would be focusing more attention on state governments.\n\n\"We see a debate going on at the state level that is really going to define the nation,\" Phillips said during a news conference at the Indiana Statehouse.\n\n\"In Washington, it's gridlock and really that's not where the action is. The action about how we get our economy moving again, how we get job creation and prosperity and incomes up, that real debate is happening at state capitals like here in Indianapolis.\"\n\nPhillips said Indiana is at the forefront of the group's effort because of its conservative governor and Republican-dominated state legislature.\n\n\"I think a lot of Indiana families, and I think the nation really, is watching to see what they are going to do with this power,\" he said. \"Are they going to kind of float around with the comfortable status quo, or is it going to be a genuinely bold attempt to get this economy moving again.\"\n\nAmericans for Prosperity has been increasingly involved in state politics. In North Carolina, the group successfully fought proposed tax hikes. In Michigan, it rallied for the passage of a right-to-work law. In Wisconsin, it's supporting the deregulation of mining.\n\nThe Indiana chapter, founded in October 2011, will launch a six-figure marketing campaign to back Pence, including TV, radio and online spots, largely in the Indianapolis market. Volunteers also will go door to door in targeted areas.\n\nOne ad, posted on YouTube, flashes a series of newspaper headlines that note the House Republicans' failure to embrace Pence's tax cut despite the state's expected budget surplus of $518 million in 2014. The ad urges Hoosiers to sign a petition supporting the tax cut at www.fightforindiana.com.\n\nPence's proposed income tax cut was a keystone of his campaign, but he's had little success persuading fellow Republicans to pass it. The cut would return $251 million to taxpayers in 2014 and $521 million in 2015. He estimates that would amount to a reduction of $228 annually for a family of four or $1,000 annually for a small business with net income of $300,000. Certain businesses can file an individual income tax return instead of a corporate return.\n\n\"We believe this tax cut is critical to keeping our state competitive and growing our economy\" said Chase Downham, president of the Indiana chapter.\n\nPence was traveling in Terre Haute on Thursday and did not attend the news conference just outside his office doors.\n\n\"Governor Pence appreciates any effort by anyone to support Hoosier taxpayers and the 10 percent tax cut,\" said his spokeswoman, Christy Denualt.\n\nIn lieu of cutting the income tax, House Republicans proposed increased spending for education and roadwork. Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma reiterated Thursday that lawmakers would consider the tax cut after the state releases its revenue forecast April 17.\n\nBosma pointed out lawmakers have made 10 cuts on various taxes during the past decade and are proposing an inheritance tax cut this year. He said he would do what is best for the state and did not feel pressured by the Americans for Prosperity, which he described as an ally, to cut income taxes.\n\n\"It's easy to kind of bang a 'Hey, let's cut taxes' drum, but you have to make sure it's a smart cut and it's sustainable in the long run, not in an election cycle.\"\n\nThe Senate now is debating the budget. But like Bosma, Republican Senate President Pro Tempore David Long has openly questioned whether the state can afford a tax cut in the long term.\n\nNow the lawmakers' positions will be publicly questioned in a media campaign by Americans for Prosperity, a group launched by Charles and David Koch, billionaires and influential conservative leaders who supported Pence's campaign for governor.\n\nDavid Koch contributed $200,000 to Pence's campaign, and the brothers' Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries donated $5,000.\n\nThe brothers are each worth $34 billion, according to a recent estimate by Forbes. That ranks them at No. 6 on the magazine's list of the world's billionaires.\n\n(Contributing: Mary Beth Schneider)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2012/09/10/post-convention-ad-crush/1408835/", "title": "Post-convention ad crush to get even heavier", "text": "Beth Fouhy, Associated Press\n\nWith candidates in a virtual dead heat ad buys key\n\nRomney free to spend millions in general election\n\nObama campaign outspent Romney through Aug. 30\n\nNEW YORK — Now the campaign ad crush and TV spending spree really begins in the presidential race.\n\nThe TV ad campaign, with total spending expected to swell to $1.1 billion, starts up again now that the party conventions are over and the two-month sprint to the general election is under way.\n\nJust over one-third of that amount has been spent so far, according to the Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks campaign ad spending.\n\nThat means the campaigns and independent groups will spend more on the air in the final eight weeks of the presidential contest than they did in the first five months.\n\nThe biggest change is on the Republican side, with Mitt Romney now free to tap millions in general election funds he had collected but could not spend until becoming the party's official nominee. That means the GOP's significant spending advantage over President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies will grow, making it the first time that an incumbent will have been outspent on the air.\n\nNational polls show Obama and Romney in a virtual dead heat, but only eight states are considered true battlegrounds: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Obama carried them all against Republican John McCain in 2008, but they are too close to call for now.\n\nFlush with new cash, the Romney campaign poured nearly $5 million into ads in those states beginning this weekend. A series of state-specific ads hit Obama on defense spending, business regulations and housing; another ad uses President Bill Clinton's words from the 2008 primary race against Obama.\n\nRepublican-leaning independent groups led by the American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS kept Romney in the game throughout the summer while he regrouped from a tough GOP primary contest. Priorities USA Action, the only significant pro-Obama super PAC, has been far outpaced by the conservative-leaning groups.\n\nThose and other independent groups emerged after a 2010 Supreme Court decision loosened campaign finance laws, allowing wealthy individuals to spend unlimited sums on political activity as long as they stay separate from the campaigns themselves. The Crossroads groups are backed by former President George W. Bush's longtime political counselor Karl Rove. Americans for Prosperity, another pro-Romney group, was founded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\n\nTogether, the Crossroads groups spent about $66 million on ads through the end of August. Of that, $58 million came from Crossroads GPS, which is organized as a social welfare group under tax laws and thus does not have to disclose its donors. AFP, which also does not disclose its donors, spent $35.2 million during that time.\n\nThe Obama campaign spent $166 million on ads through Aug. 30, compared with $74 million by the Romney campaign and $22 million by the Republican National Committee. But now, with Romney's general election resources available and the Republican-leaning groups continuing to air ads, the Obama campaign seems set to be swamped on TV.\n\n\"It will be no holds barred on the Republican side. All that money the Obama campaign has been expecting Romney to spend on ads will finally start to flow,\" Kantar/CMAG vice president Elizabeth Wilner said. \"The Obama campaign is betting on their message, while the Romney campaign is betting on tonnage.\"\n\nObama campaign officials acknowledged Friday how outmatched they are by Republicans on TV but said they had enough money to compete. They said their ability to identify voters and get them to the polls would help offset the advertising disadvantage.\n\nRomney and the independent groups spent $245 million on ads through the end of August while Obama and his allies spent $188 million, according to information from media buyers provided to The Associated Press. Obama's team front-loaded its ad spending in the spring, but Republicans caught up in June and began outspending Obama by mid-July, often by a 2-1 margin.\n\nRepublicans abandoned their efforts in Michigan and Pennsylvania after hoping to make those Democratic-leaning states competitive for Romney.\n\nThe GOP hopeful was born in and grew up in Michigan, where his father served as a popular two-term governor. Pennsylvania has a large population of white, working-class voters, which has long been one of Obama's weakest demographic groups. A significant shift in momentum for Romney could put those and other states back in play.\n\nCarl Forti, a top adviser to the Crossroads groups and Restore Our Future, another pro-Romney super PAC, said the battleground map \"absolutely\" could expand and that, if it does, the Republican-leaning groups will be eager to take advantage.\n\n\"For people who have only partially been paying attention until now, we have an opportunity to win them over,\" Forti said. \"As long as they're disgruntled with the current president, they'll continue to look elsewhere.\"\n\nBoth sides are looking at Wisconsin as a potential new battleground after Romney named Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate. Americans for Prosperity and Restore Our Future each spent about $2 million there earlier in the campaign after Republicans beat back a Democratic- and union-backed effort to recall GOP Gov. Scott Walker. Priorities USA Action has recently begun airing ads in Wisconsin, where polls still show Obama leading Romney.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jack Gillum in Washington and Jim Kuhnhenn in Portsmouth, N.H., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Beth Fouhy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/bfouhy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/03/missouri-us-senate-republican-election-results-primary-2022/10222825002/", "title": "AG Eric Schmitt wins Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Missouri", "text": "Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate on Tuesday night, according to Associated Press projections, emerging the victor from a packed and prominent primary field and positioning himself as the likely favorite entering the November general election.\n\nSchmitt, who ran a campaign defined by frequent and headline-grabbing litigation against political opponents, was propelled in the final weeks of the campaign by a storm of outside spending and criticism against one of his chief opponents, former Gov. Eric Greitens. He came out on top against Greitens, U.S. Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long, and a slew of other GOP candidates.\n\nIn his bid to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, Schmitt will face the Democratic nominee and independent conservative candidate John Wood in November. He will be the favorite to win in a Missouri that has trended increasingly toward Republicans in recent statewide races.\n\nSchmitt represented St. Louis County in the state Senate before a stint as state treasurer. He was appointed attorney general by Gov. Mike Parson in late 2018 after his predecessor and soon-to-be senior U.S. senator, Hawley, won election. Schmitt won another four-year term in 2020 before announcing his run for Senate.\n\nTrump's backing:Donald Trump endorses 'Eric' in Missouri Senate race - but doesn't say which one\n\nAs attorney general, Schmitt has filed a flurry of lawsuits that have garnered headlines. He touts the litigation as evidence that he is a \"conservative fighter\" who will \"take a blowtorch to Biden's socialist agenda.\" He has sued school districts over curriculum transparency requests, the Biden administration over COVID-19 vaccine requirements, and the nation of China for liability over early infections from the virus. Moments after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, he issued an opinion activating the state's ban on abortion.\n\nThroughout the campaign, he has frequently derided Democrats, proponents of pandemic guidelines and climate scientists and advocates alike, mocking \"the experts (tm)\" on social media and arguing that they were manufacturing crises to gain power.\n\nSchmitt was the beneficiary of significant outside spending during the primary. He saw over $7 million spent in support of his campaign, according to OpenSecrets — the most of any candidate, while super PACs backing him attacked Greitens and Hartzler. He has received the most money of any candidate in the country from Americans for Prosperity Action, a PAC extension of the libertarian conservative group founded by the Koch brothers. The group has backed him to the tune of $4.3 million.\n\nSchmitt was one of the beneficiaries of a last-minute \"endorsement\" from former President Donald Trump, who simply backed \"ERIC\" and said he \"trusts the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds.\" Both he and Greitens claimed the vague endorsement as their own.\n\nGreitens, who entered the race with the highest name recognition in the field, resigned the governorship in 2018 facing allegations of sexual misconduct and potential campaign finance violations. New accusations from his ex-wife of domestic abuse toward her and their children brought a new wave of criticism and scrutiny that led to millions of dollars of outside spending from Republican officials and donors around the country, airing frequent television, online and mail ads that center around his litany of scandals.\n\nHartzler, who has represented west-central Missouri in the House since 2011, ran a campaign touting herself as the reliable conservative choice with a proven record in Washington. She was endorsed by soon-to-be-senior U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and touted a platform defined by \"faith, family and freedom,\" but was publicly rebuked in the final weeks of the campaign by former President Donald Trump and was unable to break through the top contenders.\n\nHawley congratulated Schmitt on his victory on Twitter, writing \"now on to victory in November.\"\n\nLong, who frequently touted his early support for Trump in an effort to earn his endorsement, failed to receive it or gain momentum throughout the race. Before the winner was officially called Tuesday night, he conceded on Twitter.\n\n\"I just called (Eric Schmitt) and congratulated him on a big victory tonight and offered my full endorsement and cooperation going forward,\" Long wrote. Anything I can do to help I will and he and his great team know that. On the (sic) November!\"\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. John Danforth, who is backing independent conservative candidate and former Jan. 6 House committee lawyer John Wood, said in a statement Tuesday evening that \"the choice is clear — more of the same, divisive politics as usual or something totally new.\"\n\n\"If you think that politics is broken, that each party is off-track, that by pandering to its extremes, it has polarized America, then you can do something about it,\" Danforth said. \"You can send politicians a message that we are one united country.

The group has spent more than $19 million in support of Warnock, according to the FEC. This week, Georgia Honor announced another $5.83 million in TV ads.\n\nMajority Forward, another group affiliated with the Senate Majority PAC, is teaming up with the America Votes coalition to spend $11 million on door-to-door knocking, with a goal of knocking on 4 million doors during the runoff. In the days following the midterm election, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Democrats' fundraising arm, announced $7 million on direct voter outreach in Georgia.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dished out more than $15 million during the runoff on Walker's behalf.\n\nmore than $15 million during the runoff on Walker's behalf. The conservative advocacy group Americans For Prosperity Action used $4.5 million on the runoff. Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, said the group launched a seven-figure digital campaign, distributed more than 4.7 million pieces of mail, and knocked on nearly 500,000 doors since the runoff began.\n\nA left-leaning PAC tied to American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research group, that gets some funding from billionaire Stephen Mandel, spent more than $4 million opposing Walker. Jessica Floyd, the group's president, called the organization \"the largest opposition research and rapid response organization on the left.\"\n\nWhat is a PAC? The major engines behind election fundraising and spending explained.\n\nWhat groups are giving the most money to oppose Walker and Warnock?\n\nThree super PACs – Georgia Honor, American Bridge and VoteVets, a progressive veterans group – have spent more than $24.6 million in opposition to Walker.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Leadership Fund, Americans for Prosperity Action, 34N22, a pro-Walker PAC, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee spent nearly $21.8 million in opposition to Warnock.\n\nHow is the money being spent?\n\nThe super PACs are mostly spending money on TV ads, digital and online communications and on-the-ground canvassing.\n\nJ.B. Poersch, president of the Senate Majority PAC, said much of the ad buys emphasize Walker's \"disturbing conduct\" because it's a motivating factor for voters. In a \"Hurt So Many\" ad from Georgia Honor, Walker's ex-wife describes him holding a gun to her head and his son Christian saying Walker \"threatened to kill us.\" Walker has been accused of paying for the abortions of two ex-girlfriends, claims he denies. He has also been accused of repeatedly threatening his ex-wife’s life.\n\nFloyd, from American Bridge, said the PAC spends money performing opposition research and then putting out advertisements, including in smaller communities outside the Atlanta area.\n\nJon Soltz, head of VoteVets, said the group has spent $1.2 million on the runoff election – $850,000 on TV ads, $300,000 on digital marketing and $50,000 going to talking to veterans and military families in Georgia. VoteVets is targeting roughly 200,000 to 250,000 veterans and military families who identify as Democrat or independent in Georgia. Its TV ads focus on allegations against Walker and abortion.\n\nPete Maysmith, senior vice president of campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters, said his organization is spending more than $1.6 million targeting voters who are less motivated to vote during the runoff. “We've identified about 319,000 voters in Georgia who are not necessarily likely to turn out for the runoff and who care more about climate and environmental issues than some of the other voters in Georgia who may be less likely than not to turn out,” he said. The targeting is part of their climate voters mobilization program, which includes digital ads that tout Warnock’s support for the Inflation Reduction Act – historic legislation from the federal government that tackles climate change.\n\nthe Inflation Reduction Act – historic legislation from the federal government that tackles climate change. BlackPAC, which focuses on Black voter turnout, has spent about $2.4 million in the runoff, including on media and digital advertising. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, said her group is spending nearly $400,000 on educating Black voters about voting laws in Georgia. \"A lot of our outreach is really about raising awareness,\" Shropshire said. \"So that people have the correct information about when they need to vote.\" Shropshire said the group spends money on Black radio \"particularly outside of the Atlanta Market. \"\n\nBlackPAC and its affiliated nonpartisan Black Progressive Action Coalition have knocked on 2 million doors in Georgia during the runoff campaign, Shropshire said. By the time the runoff happens Tuesday, they will have attempted to knock on 3.5 million doors.\n\nHow impactful will money be in the runoff?\n\nAndra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said that Warnock could be seeing more support because he is an incumbent, and because he has essentially been campaigning since he was first elected, not necessarily because he’s going to win.\n\n“I wouldn’t trace any future Warnock victory to this spending,” she said. “This is a highly competitive race and there are people who care about the stakes of the election.”\n\nGillespie also pointed to Walker being a weak candidate, due to allegations he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortions.\n\n“I think some people are speaking with their dollars in terms of sort of a recognition of the weaknesses and the challenges he faces as a candidate and a reluctance to invest money in his candidacy,” she said.\n\nCharles Bullock, a longtime political scientist at the University of Georgia, said spending millions of dollars on digital ads retelling Walker’s abortion allegations isn’t new for Georgia voters who have made it through the general election.\n\nBut Bullock said for some voters, Walker’s scandals could persuade them to vote for Warnock.\n\n“Perhaps a finely tuned message that you then direct at a specific component of the electorate might then be the element that prompts some of those recipients to say, ‘Gee, I hadn't planned to vote, but now that I've heard this, I think I will go and vote,'” Bullock said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/10/12/donald-trump-ron-desantis-nikki-haley-organizing-ground-game-iowa-republican-caucus-2024/71072208007/", "title": "Trump, DeSantis, Haley: Who has the strongest Iowa Caucus ...", "text": "Florida Gov.

In both, a nefarious man attempts to trick his new wife into thinking she’s losing her mind, in part by telling her that the gaslights in their home, which dim when he’s in the attic doing dastardly deeds, are not fading at all.\n\nBoth the play and film were wildly popular, with a renamed version of the play running for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway, and the 1944 film earning a best picture nomination and an Oscar for Ingrid Bergman. Partly due to the film’s popularity, the noun “gaslight” became a verb, too.\n\nIn the context of the film, “gaslighting” refers to the “psychological manipulation of a person over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question” their reality, according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nGaslighting in politics, media and entertainment\n\n“Gaslighting” has in the last few years become a ubiquitous term, particularly in the “age of misinformation,” Merriam-Webster said. In 2017, a CNN opinion writer said President Donald Trump was “‘gaslighting’ all of us” after he denied making several statements he’d made in public. CNN’s Chris Cillizza used the word again in 2021 to describe the way Trump downplayed the severity of the January 6 insurrection.\n\nIt’s also a legitimate and “extremely effective form of emotional abuse,” according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has resources for survivors on recognizing gaslighting. The New York Times also this year wrote about “medical gaslighting,” when patients, especially women and people of color, are dismissed by physicians who downplay the severity of their symptoms.\n\nThis year in particular, interest in the word “gaslighting” has surged, per Merriam-Webster, with a 1740% increase in searches for the term.\n\nThe word continued making its way into popular media this year: “Gaslit” is the name of a limited series starring Julia Roberts set during the Watergate scandal of the ’70s. The young, rich cast of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” accuse each other of gaslighting when tensions run high. HBO’s “The White Lotus,” as well as recent film “Don’t Worry Darling” (both properties of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) also feature characters gaslighting each other.\n\nWhile other commonly searched words, including “omicron” and “queen consort,” reflect specific events or episodes of 2022, “gaslighting” refers to a phenomenon that isn’t fleeting but rather an ingrained part of our lives, per Merriam-Webster.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/28/merriam-webster-gaslighting-2022-word/10788960002/", "title": "Merriam-Websters selects 'gaslighting' for 2022 word of the year", "text": "Merriam-Webster has announced its 2022 word of the year: \"gaslighting.\"\n\nGaslighting – defined broadly as \"the act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one’s own advantage\" – gained significant interest throughout the year.

It was first used to mean 'ghost,' 'specter,' or 'wraith,' and then developed the meaning \"one who returns to a former place after prolonged absence\"; both meanings seem to fit the film’s story.\"\n\n\"Icon\" also appears on the list, and spiked in search in April after the death of Prince. \"Icon means 'a person who is very successful and admired,' and is the root word of iconic and iconoclastic, both of which also showed smaller spikes during the same period,\" the dictionary wrote. \"It’s interesting that Prince should be described both with the words icon and iconoclast, which originally meant 'one who destroys religious images'— or, in a sense, 'one who destroys icons.'”\n\nSee the full list here.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/us/merriam-webster-new-words-slang-cec/index.html", "title": "Yeet!

The term became the go-to way of describing former President Donald Trump’s devotion to creating false realities through repeated lies all the way back in 2016. As one of the first people to apply the term to Trump’s rejection of reality (in a viral piece for US News & World Report in March 2016), I’ve paid attention as the word entered the political lexicon and broadened until it became, essentially, a synonym of “lying.”\n\nNicole Hemmer Courtesy Nicole Hemmer\n\nBut in that broadening, something has been lost. A particular moment spurred me to think of Trump’s habitual dissembling in gaslighting terms.

Lewandowski denied touching Fields.)\n\nThe incident was filmed and the video widely circulated. Yet when I came home and turned on the news that night, there was Trump, denying that it had happened. I was so confused that I hopped online to make sure I hadn’t mistaken what I had seen (I was not yet acclimated to Trump’s steady stream of lies).\n\nThe disorientation I felt in that moment reminded me of gaslighting, a term derived from the 1938 play “Gas Light” (later turned into a film), which depicted a husband psychologically torturing his wife to the point that she questions her own grasp of reality. In the cases of both “Gas Light” and the Lewandowski incident, the core question was one of men menacing women. Those connotations made the term especially apt for Trump, who has faced dozens of allegations of sexual harassment and assault (which he has denied) and regularly attacked women in his speeches.\n\nBut that aspect of gaslighting did not make it into the popular understanding of the word. The team at Merriam-Webster argues that it caught on because it describes a particular type of lying that defined the past several years in US politics: “The idea of a deliberate conspiracy to mislead has made gaslighting useful in describing lies that are part of a larger plan.” That it has roots in domestic abuse is relegated to part of what Merriam-Webster describes as the word’s “colorful” origins.\n\nCharles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman in 1944 film, \"Gaslight.\" Everett Collection\n\nThis loss of context for a single word might not feel urgently important – after all, words evolve as they work their way from novel to commonplace to, eventually, trite (as the word “gaslighting” now feels after years of overuse). But in a culture where histories of abuse are regularly erased – even five years into the #MeToo movement – the erasure feels significant.\n\nGaslighting describes a particular type of psychological abuse, where the abuser repeatedly undermines and contradicts the victim’s perception of the world, to the point where she questions her own experiences and memories. In the play “Gas Light,” the goal was to swindle the woman out of money. But the broader purpose is to make women uncertain and dependent, to render them unreliable narrators of their own experiences — especially experiences of abuse, harassment and assault.\n\nGaslighting, then, is a fundamental element in the infrastructure of a culture that does not believe women. That’s why the phrase “believe women” became such a powerful rallying cry during the #MeToo movement — not because women cannot lie or make mistakes, but because undermining women’s credibility had been a key tool of abuse.\n\nWhile women are gaslighting’s main victims, its consequences extend much further. The space where domestic abuse most quickly disappears is around public violence, in particular mass shootings. Studies show that domestic violence is deeply entwined in mass shootings: The majority of perpetrators have histories of domestic violence. Domestic homicide or attempted homicide often precedes mass shootings (as was the case in Uvalde and Sandy Hook) and domestic violence-related mass shootings are deadlier than other mass shootings.\n\nAnd yet when it comes to public debate about mass shootings, addressing domestic violence is seldom near the top of the list. That’s possibly because mass shootings, though relatively common in the US, are rare compared to rates of domestic violence: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 41% of women and 26% of men experience intimate-partner violence. Domestic violence in the United States is so common, it seems, that it quickly disappears from public consciousness.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe #MeToo movement focused less on domestic abuse than workplace abuse, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. As the movement emerged, many men were shaken that so many of the women they knew had experienced abuse. And yet even in a moment when abuse of women commanded national attention, a counter-movement quickly emerged asking whether #MeToo had gone “too far” (despite the relatively small number of abusers who experienced any sort of lasting consequences).\n\nSustained attention to abuse of women – and the patriarchal norms and structures that underwrite it – requires constant reminders of the way it shapes culture, politics and even language in the US. Yes, gaslighting is just one small word that has been stripped of its origins in domestic abuse. But it is a word that named a particular form of abuse, and gave women a way to talk about attacks on their credibility, that empowered them to claim their experience. That makes it a word whose origins deserve to be fully recognized. While gaslighting as a synonym for lying feels hackneyed in 2022, as a description of efforts to undermine women’s credibility, it is as relevant as ever.", "authors": ["Nicole Hemmer"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/30/pandemic-merriam-websters-top-word-year-2020/6461620002/", "title": "'Pandemic' is Merriam-Webster's top word of the year in 2020", "text": "Leanne Italie\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK – If you were to choose a word that rose above most in 2020, which word would it be?\n\nDing-ding-ding: Merriam-Webster on Monday announced “pandemic” as its 2020 word of the year.\n\n“That probably isn't a big shock,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster, told The Associated Press.\n\n“Often the big news story has a technical word that's associated with it, and in this case, the word 'pandemic' is not just technical but has become general. It's probably the word by which we'll refer to this period in the future,” he said.\n\nThe word took on urgent specificity in March, when the coronavirus outbreak was designated a pandemic, but it started to trend up on Merriam-Webster.com as early as January and again in February when the first U.S. deaths and outbreaks on cruise ships occurred.\n\nOn March 11, when the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, lookups on the site for pandemic spiked. Site interest for the word has remained significantly high through the year, Sokolowski said.\n\nSearches for \"pandemic\" on March 11 were 115,806% higher than look-ups experienced on the same date last year, Sokolowski said.\n\n\"Pandemic,\" with roots in Latin and Greek, is a combination of “pan,” for all, and “demos,” for people or population. The latter is the same root of “democracy,” Sokolowski noted. The word \"pandemic\" dates to the mid-1600s, used broadly for “universal” and more specifically to disease in a medical text in the 1660s, he said.\n\nThat was after the plagues of the Middle Ages, Sokolowski said.\n\nHe attributes the traffic for \"pandemic\" not entirely to searchers who didn't know what it meant but also to those on the hunt for more detail, or for inspiration or comfort.\n\n“We see that the word 'love' is looked up around Valentine's Day and the word 'cornucopia' is looked up at Thanksgiving,” Sokolowski said. “We see a word like 'surreal' spiking when a moment of national tragedy or shock occurs. It's the idea of dictionaries being the beginning of putting your thoughts in order.”\n\nMerriam-Webster acted quickly in March to add and update entries on its site for words related to the pandemic. While “coronavirus” had been in the dictionary for decades, “COVID-19” was coined in February. Thirty-four days later, Merriam-Webster had it up online, along with a couple of dozen other entries that were revised to reflect the health emergency.\n\n“That's the shortest period of time we've ever seen a word go from coinage to entry,” Sokolowski said. “The word had this urgency.”\n\n\"Coronavirus\" was among runners-up for word of the year as it jumped into the mainstream. \"Quarantine,\" \"asymptomatic,\" \"mamba,\" \"kraken,\" \"defund,\" \"antebellum,\" \"irregardless,\" \"icon,\" \"schadenfreude\" and \"malarkey\" also were runners-up based on search spikes around specific events.\n\nParticularly interesting to word nerds like Sokolowski, a lexicographer, is \"quarantine.\" With Italian roots, it was used during the Black Death of the 1300s for the period of time a new ship coming into port would have to wait outside a city to prevent disease. The “quar” in quarantine derives from 40, for the 40 days required.\n\nSpikes for \"mamba\" occurred after the death in January of Kobe Bryant, whose nickname was the Black Mamba. A mass of searches occurred for \"kraken\" in July after Seattle's new National Hockey League franchise chose the mythical sea monster as its name, urged along by fans.\n\nCountry group Lady Antebellum's name change to Lady A drove dictionary interest in June, and \"malarkey\" got a boost from President-elect Joe Biden, who's fond of using the word. \"Icon\" was front and center in headlines after the deaths of Rep. John Lewis and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster site has about 40 million unique monthly users and about 100 million monthly page views.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/12/10/merriam-websters-2019-word-year-they/4385969002/", "title": "Merriam-Webster's 2019 word of the year is 'they'", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK — A common but increasingly mighty and very busy little word, “they,” has an accolade all its own.\n\nThe language mavens at Merriam-Webster have declared the personal pronoun their word of the year based on a 313% increase in look-ups on the company's search site, Merriam-Webster.com, this year when compared with 2018.\n\n“I have to say it's surprising to me,” said Peter Sokolowski, a lexicographer and Merriam-Webster's editor at large, ahead of Tuesday's announcement. “It's a word we all know and love. So many people were talking about this word.”\n\nSokolowski and his team monitor spikes in searches and “they” got an early start in January with the rise of model Oslo Grace on top fashion runways.

In October, the American Psychological Association endorsed “they” as a singular third-person pronoun in its latest style guide for scholarly writing.\n\n“We believe writers should try to use a person's self-identified pronoun whenever feasible,” said Jasper Simons, chief publishing officer for the APA. “The singular ‘they’ is a way for writers to avoid making assumptions about gender when it is not known.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society, which is dedicated to the study of the English language in North America, named “they” its word of the year for 2015, in recognition of its emergence among people who reject “he” and “she.”\n\nIn September, Merriam-Webster experienced another big increase in look-ups for “they” when pop star Sam Smith wrote on social media that their preferred pronouns were “they” and “them.\" Smith said the decision came after a “lifetime of being at war with my gender.\"\n\nMore:Sam Smith says he is 'nonbinary, genderqueer,' describes 'war within'\n\nSokolowski told the Associated Press that “they,” one of a handful of nonbinary pronouns to emerge in recent years, is “here to stay.” Nick Adams, director of transgender representation for the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, said Merriam-Webster's choice is a positive step in acknowledging nonbinary people.\n\n“There is a long road ahead before language, policy and culture are completely affirming and inclusive,” Adams said.\n\nThe AP Stylebook allows the use of “they” as a singular or gender-neutral pronoun in some cases.\n\nAnd the Merriam-Webster runners-up to word of the year?\n\nThey include “quid pro quo,” “impeach” and \"crawdad,” the latter a word in the title of Delia Evans best-selling novel, “Where the Crawdads Sing.” The Top 10 also included “egregious,” “clemency\" and “the,” a shocker of a look-up spike when Ohio State University attempted to patent the word to protect its turf. It failed.\n\nAlso in the mix: “snitty,” which emerged on the lips of Attorney General William Barr in reference to a letter by Robert Mueller about a summary Barr wrote of the Mueller report.\n\nWe have Washington Post columnist George Will to thank for “tergiversation.” The word, meaning an evasion or a desertion, was Merriam-Webster's top look-up on Jan. 24 after Will used it in a column in reference to Lindsey Graham.\n\nThe words “camp” and “exculcate” rounded out the Top 10 list.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/27/most-used-slang-words-2023/71721288007/", "title": "Most used slang terms for 2023 include Sus, Bet, 'Yeet'.

But the move seemed to go largely unnoticed until this week, when the dictionary’s expanded definition of “woman” garnered backlash from conservative commentators on social media and was subsequently covered by right-leaning media outlets.\n\nWhile the Cambridge Dictionary’s primary definition for “woman” remains “an adult female human being,” a second definition refers to “an adult who lives and identifies as female though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.” Similarly, the British reference guide defines “man” as “an adult male human being” and also “an adult who lives and identifies as male though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.”\n\nExample sentences provided by the dictionary include “Mary is a woman who was assigned male at birth” and “Their doctor encouraged them to live as a man for a while before undergoing surgical transition.”\n\n“(Our editors) carefully studied usage patterns of the word woman and concluded that this definition is one that learners of English should be aware of to support their understanding of how the language is used,” a Cambridge Dictionary spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “The first definition at the entry for woman remains unchanged and continues to be ‘an adult female human being’.”\n\nThe definition of “woman” has become yet another frontier in the culture wars in recent years. Earlier this week, Scotland’s highest court dismissed a legal challenge brought by the group For Women Scotland, who argued that trans women shouldn’t be included in the definition of “women” under a law aimed at improving the gender balance on public boards. In the US, Republican politicians have repeatedly evoked the definition of “woman” in their attacks on transgender people.\n\nEarlier this week, Dictionary.com announced “woman” as its 2022 word of the year, citing how “the very matter of the definition of the word ‘woman’ was at the center of so many consequential moments, discussions, and decisions in our society.”\n\nDespite the outcry deeming Cambridge Dictionary’s new definitions to be a political statement, the spokesperson said that such changes are meant to provide an accurate depiction of how certain words are used in society.\n\n“Our dictionaries are written for learners of English and are designed to help users understand English as it is currently used,” the statement read. “They are compiled by analysing a large corpus of English texts (over 2 billion words in total) taken from all areas of writing and publishing, which allows us to see exactly how language is used. We regularly update our dictionary to reflect changes in how English is used, based on analysis of data from this corpus.”\n\nOther dictionaries have made similar changes to terms around gender and gender identity over the years.\n\nIn 2020, Merriam-Webster expanded its definition of “female” to include “having a gender identity that is the opposite of male” – that change also drew criticism from conservatives, though a similar addition was made to the word “male.” The year before, Merriam-Webster added a new definition to the pronoun “they” to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}]}

We know we still have to improve a lot and we know some areas where we have to really work on,” he said. “That’s not only on the car, but power-wise we need more. I hope we learn from the last few years, it’s not like we do it on purpose.”\n\nHe has earned plaudits during a season when he was the only driver to ever trouble Mercedes, even with a slower car.\n\n“Absolutely clinical,” team principal Christian Horner told Verstappen on the team radio.\n\nHamilton praised Verstappen and expects him to challenge more strongly in 2021.\n\n“We've obviously got a fight on our hands next year, no doubt,” said Hamilton, who was driving after recovering from the coronavirus. \"It was a really hard race for me physically. All year physically I have been fine, but today I definitely wasn’t. I am just glad it is over.\"\n\nAlexander Albon completed a good race for Red Bull by finishing fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, but it might not be enough for Albon to keep his place next year.\n\nNorris' fifth place was enough to clinch third place in the constructors’ championship ahead of Racing Point, causing McLaren's garage to cheer wildly after the finish.\n\nThe 23-year-old Verstappen had secured a brilliant pole position, and made a good start while Bottas comfortably held off Hamilton. The world champion looked off form and started to drift back after a few laps, and was nearly caught by Albon on the last two laps.\n\nThe race was briefly held up when the safety car came out after Sergio Perez's Racing Point pulled to the side of the track with engine failure on Lap 10. When it restarted a few laps later, Verstappen got away from Bottas cleanly and posted the fastest lap for the second time in 15 laps.\n\nHalfway through the 55-lap race, Verstappen looked comfortable as he led Bottas by about six seconds and Hamilton by nine and then increased the gap under the floodlights.\n\n“Red Bull were too quick today, surprisingly quick,” Bottas said. “Being beaten by Red Bull in the last race of the season, it motivates us even more to work harder over the winter.”\n\nHamilton won 11 races from the 16 he entered and finished with 347 points, compared to 223 for second-place Bottas and 214 for third-place Verstappen.\n\nHamilton missed last Sunday’s Sakhir GP in Bahrain after catching COVID-19, denying the seven-time F1 champion the opportunity to equal Vettel’s single-season record of 13 wins seven years ago.\n\nSeveral drivers were competing for the last time for their teams and possibly in F1.\n\nPerez drove brilliantly to win the Sakhir GP in Bahrain last Sunday but has no seat next year, and his race ended in frustration with his father wringing his hands as he watched from the team garage. Despite the disappointing finish, he secured fourth in the drivers' championship.\n\n“It is sad to be leaving the team this way, some of them were crying at the end,” the Mexican driver said. \"Whatever comes next I will be ready for it.”\n\nHaas driver Kevin Magnussen, who is also out of F1 now, was 18th.\n\nVettel’s last race for Ferrari saw him finish 14th. The four-time F1 champion is replacing Perez at Racing Point when it becomes Aston Martin next year.\n\nMcLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr., who will replace Vettel at Ferrari next year, finished sixth, while Daniel Ricciardo — who will replace him at McLaren in 2021 — crossed seventh and clocked the fastest lap in his last for Renault.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/19/motorsport/max-verstappen-canadian-grand-prix-f1-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Max Verstappen holds off Carlos Sainz to win Canadian Grand Prix ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMax Verstappen held off the challenge of Carlos Sainz to triumph at the Canadian Grand Prix for the first time in his career on Sunday, further extending his lead atop the Formula One drivers’ championship.\n\nThe reigning world champion prevailed in a nail-biting end-of-race fight with the Ferrari driver to secure his sixth win of the season and his second in a row after claiming a victory in Azerbaijan.\n\nThe victory moves him 46 points clear in the championship ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez, whose early retirement due to a mechanical failure provided a blemish on the team’s sixth consecutive race win.\n\nHaving surged into a commanding lead from pole, it had looked set to be yet another comfortable weekend for the Red Bull driver before AlphaTauri driver Yuki Tsunoda hit the wall on his exit from the pits on lap 49.\n\nWith the field bunched upon the exit of the safety car six laps later, an enthralling battle between Verstappen and Sainz ensued, the gap at just over half a second heading into the final lap.\n\nVerstappen keeps Sainz at bay.

He posted a time of 1:13.078 in 2019.\n\nWho won the F1 race in Canada last year?\n\nMax Verstappen won last year's Canadian Grand Prix. It was his first win in Montréal.

It's the first time F1 is in the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas since 1981 and 1982, when Alain Prost and Niki Lauda raced in the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in the resort's parking lot. Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg both finished fifth in the two races to claim their respective drivers' championships.\n\nThis year's track is much different as Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris will race on the famous Strip in a night race with the city's lights shining down. The championship is already wrapped up as Verstappen won his third straight title at the Qatar Grand Prix last month, but there is still competition among the rest of the grid. Amonst drivers, Fernando Alonso, Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz are all within six points of each other for fourth place; in the constructor's standings, Ferrari is within 20 points of Mercedes for second place.\n\nWith traffic jams and sky-high ticket prices, fans have been concerned about the cost of attending the race and what it actually means to the community. Beyond the racing, Formula 1 has embraced the culture of the city. Among the weekend's festivities, there is an F1-themed wedding chapel and the Bellagio is hosting a shoey bar for fans to celebrate like Daniel Ricciardo. Here is everything you need to know about the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix:\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix schedule\n\nPractice 1: Thursday, Nov. 16, 11:30 p.m. ET\n\nThursday, Nov. 16, 11:30 p.m. ET Practice 2: Friday, Nov. 17, 3 a.m. ET\n\nFriday, Nov. 17, 3 a.m. ET Practice 3: Friday, Nov. 17, 11:30 p.m. ET\n\nFriday, Nov. 17, 11:30 p.m. ET Qualifying: Saturday, Nov. 18, 3 a.m. ET\n\nSaturday, Nov. 18, 3 a.m. ET Race: Sunday, Nov. 19, 1 a.m. ET\n\nThe Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix will follow the traditional race weekend format with three practice sessions, qualifying and the race. The times are a little later than usual for a race weekend on American soil.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix start time\n\nThe lights will go out at the inaugural F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix at 10 p.m. local time Saturday (1 a.m. ET) on Sunday morning.\n\nThere are a few reasons why the race is so late. First, race organizers wanted to be fair to the sport's European viewers. That is, according to Las Vegas GP Ceo Renee Wilm.\n\n\"That was actually a compromise to make sure we are broadcasting at a time when our European fans can get up with a cup of coffee and watch the race six, seven in the morning, very similar to how we [in the US] watch the European races,\" Wilm said recently.\n\n\"So that was actually a very important component of planning out our sequencing for the race weekend.\"\n\nThe organizers also had to find time in order to close off Vegas' busy streets in order to make the race work. With the circuit driving through the Vegas strip,\n\nOrganizers also wanted to embrace the culture of Las Vegas, the entertainment capital of the world. While F1 has expanded to three races in the United States — Austin, Miami, Las Vegas — each one has been unique to the vibe of the location.\n\nHow to watch the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix\n\nThe Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix will air on television on ESPN.\n\nThe race will be live streamed on ESPN3 and ESPN+.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas ticket prices\n\nInitial entry fees for the Las Vegas Grand Prix were around $2,000 on the low end. The average price was around $7,000. Hotels saw their rates soar in anticipation of the global event, tailor-made for international high-rollers.\n\nKTNV Las Vegas reports that ticket prices have been cut by nearly 60 percent, but it hasn't just been tickets. Hotels near the event have slashed their prices up to 80 percent for nights leading up to the race.\n\nFurthermore, the Grand Prix initially charged fees to any business or hotel that had a view of the race, threatening to build statues in the sightlines of any building that had a view and did not pay. Those fees eventually came down, but it set a bad tone for the city. Never mind all the construction that took place as well near the end of the Strip, forcing large traffic jams across the city for weeks. — Jon Hoefling\n\nTickets for the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix on resale websites have been popular, as well.\n\nAs of Monday, the race was one of the top 10 sports events of the year on StubHub, per the resale company. The average price for a three-day pass to the race was $2,100.\n\nOn Thursday, a three-day pass for the race started at $759 on StubHub and $856 on SeatGeek.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix track details\n\nThe track for the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix runs along the famous Strip. The 17-turn circuit is 3.853 miles/6.201 kilometers around with the paddock located off the Strip at the intersection of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane. Drivers will wind around the Sphere before taking Sands Avenue to the Strip where they will pass The Venetian, The Mirage, Caesars Palace, The Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan.\n\nSafety issues on the Vegas track\n\nThe FIA is inspecting drain covers around the Las Vegas Grand Prix track after the concrete frame around one failed, bringing an early end to first practice.\n\nCarlos Sainz was running at high speed on the Strip when he approached a yellow flag, then hitting something that led to his engine switching off. The heavy impact was audible onboard, and the session was red flagged to allow for the Ferrari to be cleared. At the same time, FIA personnel went out on track to inspect the area, and soon confirmed the session would not be resumed.\n\n“Following inspection, it was the concrete frame around a manhole cover that has failed,” an FIA spokesperson said. “We now need to check all of the other manhole covers which will take some time – we will be discussing with the local circuit engineering team about the length of time it will take to resolve and will update with any resultant changes to the schedule.”\n\nRead the full story.\n\nHow weather affects Formula 1 cars\n\nThe weather does affect the performance of an F1 car. The colder the weather is, the less the tires stick to the track. The extended time it takes for the tires to warm up means more power is exerted. The cold also affects the brakes, which means the drivers will have a harder time controlling the cars and they could face lockups, and it will take longer for brakes to heat up.\n\nThat could spell trouble, as the Las Vegas Grand Prix has the potential to be the coldest race in Formula 1 history. Temperatures are expected to be 49 degrees Fahrenheit/9.4 degrees Celsius with a humidity of 65 percent.\n\nThe previous record for the coldest F1 race was the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal where temperatures dropped to 41 degrees Fahrenheit/5 degrees Celsius.\n\nWho will win the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix?\n\nMax Verstappen (-250) is the favorite to win the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, according to BetMGM Formula 1 odds. This would mean the Red Bull Racing driver won all three races in the United States in his historic season that at one point had a record 10-race win streak\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris (+900) has the second best odds to win the race followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (+1200), Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez (+1400) and Leclerc's teammate Carlos Sainz (+1400). Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton (+1800) has the sixth best odds of taking home the trophy.\n\nIf you’re new to sports betting, don’t worry. We have tips for beginners on how to place a bet online.

The Red Bull driver took a four-point lead over seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton in the standings.\n\n“That was master class and you’re leading the championship. Well done, mate,” Red Bull team principal Christian Horner radioed to Verstappen as he crossed the finish line.\n\nIt is the first time since the German Grand Prix in 2018 that Mercedes has not led the championship. Hamilton finished seventh on an uncharacteristically bad day for the usually reliable Mercedes team.\n\nBottas retired from the race after a right-front wheel stub axle was stripped during his pit stop and Mercedes could not remove the tire.\n\nVerstappen sprinted over to his team and jumped into their arms after the race.\n\n“It is so special to win here. Of course I’m very proud,” Verstappen said. “But I’m thinking ahead to the rest of the season.”\n\nHe was then greeted by tennis star Serena Williams, who waved the checkered flag and was an honorary guest at the event.\n\n“It’s so special around here to win. It’s my first time on the podium here,” said Verstappen, whose father Jos secured two podiums in 106 F1 races and was seven-time F1 champion Michael Schumacher’s teammate at Benetton.\n\n“I remember when I was very little, you always want to win this one.”\n\nVerstappen finished 8.9 seconds ahead of Carlos Sainz Jr. of Ferrari. Lando Norris scored his third career podium the same week he signed a contract extension with McLaren.\n\n“I don’t know what to say, it’s a dream to be on the podium here,” the 21-year-old British driver said. “I didn’t think it was going to happen. I’ll cherish it.”\n\nSergio Perez was fourth for Red Bull, which moved back on top of the constructors championship ahead of Mercedes.\n\nMercedes has won the last seven drivers’ and constructors’ championships, but Sunday marked the first time in five races this season that Hamilton and Verstappen did not finish 1-2.\n\nSergio Perez was fourth for Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel was fifth for his best finish of the season.\n\nLeclerc’s chances of winning his home race from pole position ended when he pulled off track with a gearbox problem. He crashed with 18 seconds remaining in Saturday qualifying and risked a five-place grid penalty if Ferrari changed his gearbox.\n\nThe team initially said Leclerc was good to go and the gearbox was fine, but about 20 minutes before the race Leclerc drove to the garage. Two years ago, Leclerc retired early in Monaco in his first season at Ferrari.\n\nThe race director decided not to move Verstappen up from second to pole and left that space blank, giving Bottas more room to overtake on the inside. He never got the chance as Verstappen pounced at the start.\n\nThe 3.4-kilometer (2.1-mile) course is the hardest in F1 to overtake on, and Hamilton found himself stuck in traffic for most of the race. Hamilton took a bonus point for the fastest lap toward the end, a rare bright spot on a dismal day for the defending champion and his team.\n\nMonaco Grand Prix Results\n\nSunday at Circuit de MonacoMonte Carlo, Monaco.

His run of 10 straight wins, an all-time F1 record, from May to September left him far ahead in the standings.\n\n“A fantastic feeling.

Both Ocon and Perez’s cars were left stuck in the gravel.\n\nF1 organized a light show in the pit lane to mark Verstappen’s title, but since it was a sprint race and not a full Grand Prix, there was no podium ceremony. Instead, Verstappen, Piastri and Norris were awarded plaques for placing in the top three.\n\nIt stood in contrast to the dramatic and controversial battle which saw Verstappen win his first title in Abu Dhabi in 2021. It also had clarity which was missing when Verstappen took the title at the Japanese Grand Prix last year amid confusion over how many points he should get after a red flag.\n\nBoth the venue in Qatar and the format are modern additions to F1. The Losail circuit and the sprint events — which Verstappen has opposed in the past — were both added to the calendar in Verstappen’s first title year in 2021.\n\nPerez seemed capable of challenging Verstappen when he won two of the first four races of this season, but hasn’t won since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April. Perez has been let down by frequent mistakes in qualifying. Eight times in 17 championship rounds, he has failed to reach the final qualifying session which decides the top 10 places, leaving him at a major disadvantage on race day.\n\nPiastri followed up his first Grand Prix podium in Japan two weeks ago with his first victory in an F1 race, even if the sprint doesn’t count as an official Grand Prix win. “It’s a bit of a weird feeling because it’s not a race win. It does feel a little bit strange,” he said.\n\nAhead of the Qatar Grand Prix race on Sunday, the sport’s governing body, the FIA, said Saturday it could mandate at least three pit stops with tire changes. That follows concerns that the side walls of the Pirelli tires have been damaged when cars run over the pointed “pyramid” kerbs used in Qatar.\n\nThe track has already been narrowed at one point to stop cars running quite as wide over the kerbs.

According to The Times, Durand approached her co-author Omid Scobie about writing a book at the time of the couple’s wedding in 2018.\n\nThe Times described her as “a far sterner royalist than her British co-author”, adding that she been working on the royal press circuit in the UK for almost 20 years, although is originally from the US.\n\nShe has reported on the royals for several American and UK outlets, including ELLE and Oprah Magazine, according to her publisher HarperCollins. She has also produced multiple interviews with members of the Royal Family, including Prince Harry.\n\nOmid Scobie\n\nScobie has covered the Royal Family for Harper’s Bazaar for the last eight years and is currently the magazine’s royal editor, according to his Twitter profile. He has travelled around the world reporting on royal events and has extensively covered the younger members of the Royal Family, “particularly Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle”, according to the Daily Mirror.\n\nHe hosts his own podcast, The Heir Pod, and is a contributor for ABC News on the popular breakfast television show, Good Morning America.\n\nAs Elite Daily notes, he has a significant following on Twitter, boasting 71,000 followers – “so he’s definitely solidified himself as a go-to source with royal fans”, the celebrity news website said.\n\nScobie was caught in a brief media storm himself last year, after claims he lied about his age during the interview in The Times with journalist Andrew Billen.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Scobie told Billen he was 33, but he later denied he had mentioned his age, revealing to Tatler that he was in fact five years older.\n\nScobie said Billen was “trying to insinuate” that he was the same age as author Andrew Morton when he wrote his controversial biography of Princess Diana, titled Diana: Her True Story. But Billen claims transcripts from the interview show that Scobie had given his age as 33, not 38.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/royals/960897/prince-harry-and-meghan-catastrophic-car-chase-under-the-microscope", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan: 'near catastrophic car chase' in the ...", "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s involvement in what they called a “near catastrophic car chase” with US paparazzi in Manhattan has been put under the microscope amid claim and counterclaim from those involved.\n\nHarry and Meghan were attending the Ms. Foundation’s Women of Vision annual gala at the Ziegfeld Ballroom, during which the Duchess of Sussex was honoured by Gloria Steinem for her “global advocacy to empower and advocate on behalf of women and girls”, reported Good Morning America.\n\nBut the night turned sour when, according to the couple’s spokesperson, they were “involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sukhcharn Singh, who drove the couple on part of their journey, said the description of the situation as “catastrophic” was “exaggerated”.\n\n‘Impossible not to think of Princess Diana’\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, the couple’s press secretary Ashley Hansen said: “I have never experienced their vulnerability as much as I did last night. They were incredibly scared and shaken up.”\n\nJournalist Omid Scobie, who has written biographies of the royal couple, told BBC Newsnight that it was “impossible not to think of Princess Diana when we hear about car accidents and this kind of aggressive paparazzi chase”.\n\nThe Sussexes’ account of “a relentless pursuit” is a “percussive succession of coincidences and details that will make the blood of every right thinking person boil”, agreed The Independent’s Samuel Fishwick.\n\n“Let us not forget the terms on which the prince began his campaign of retribution against the press in that infamous Oprah Winfrey interview back in 2021,” added Fishwick.\n\n“The clicking of cameras and the flashing of cameras makes my blood boil,” he told Winfrey. “It makes me angry and takes me back to what happened to my mum and my experience as a kid.”\n\n‘Cynical timing’\n\nA photographer familiar with the market for celebrity pictures in New York suggested to The Guardian that “the claims could be designed to play into the Diana, Princess of Wales narrative, given how popular she was in the US”.\n\nThey told the paper: “‘Americans are a bit more sympathetic to the couple than the Brits right now.’”\n\n“There are jokes, too, that photographers are tipped off by the couple themselves,” said The Guardian’s Edward Helmore, recalling the “sniping” of former TV anchor Megyn Kelly when Meghan was photographed going hiking with friends in California on the day of her father-in-law’s coronation.\n\n“A cynical observer might question the timing of their bombshell statement”, wrote The Telegraph’s associate editor Camilla Tominey. It came “just a day after Harry’s lawyers appeared in the High Court arguing that it was not only wrong of him to be stripped of his armed Metropolitan Police protection when he is back in the UK, but unfair for him to have been denied the right to reimburse the taxpayer for it”.\n\nThe events on the streets of Manhattan “don’t form part of the case against the tabloid press which Harry is fighting in London, but they neatly, some say conveniently, embolden his cause”, agreed Sky News’s US correspondent Mark Stone.\n\n“As is often the case with the British royal family,” said Intelligencer, “there’s still plenty of confusion and controversy surrounding the incident.”", "authors": ["Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/royals/960442/prince-harry-coronation-royal-rift", "title": "King's coronation: does Prince Harry's return signal end of royal rift ...", "text": "Prince Harry has confirmed that he will attend the King’s coronation next month, albeit without his wife Meghan Markle, amid growing hopes that father and son will be reconciled.\n\nAfter weeks of “delicate negotiations”, described by the Daily Mail as a game of “transatlantic ping pong”, Prince Harry will attend the coronation on 6 May, but Meghan and their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet will remain at their home in California.\n\nHarry’s trip to the UK will be little more than a flying visit, with the Duke of Sussex expected to attend just the Westminster Abbey coronation service and spend little personal time with the royal family.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Royal sources told the paper that his decision to attend has “pleased” the King, who is “keen to have the support of both his sons at the ceremony”.\n\nThe paper added that there had been “growing speculation that the pair may even have spoken in recent weeks”. But Prince Harry’s relationship with his brother William is still said to be “fraught”, with the heir to the throne understood to feel “deeply betrayed by the many personal family revelations the Duke has made in his memoir” and other media interviews.\n\nHarry had been said to be holding out for “peace talks” with his family over the royal rift, but has decided to attend the coronation “regardless”. His decision is said to have “prompted positive conversations that both sides hope will pave the way, in the longer term, for reconciliation between father and son”.\n\nOne source told The Telegraph: “It is about showing up, showing support and being there for his father. It was a very personal decision, not a PR one.”\n\nA source told The Sun that the King “is happy that Harry, his son, who he calls his ‘darling boy’ will be at the Abbey”. The King is “very disappointed that he won’t see Meghan or his grandchildren but understands the situation”.\n\n“The ‘Will they? Won’t they?’ question of whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would attend has hung over King Charles’s coronation for months,” said Caroline Davies in The Guardian. Organisers have been “increasingly impatient” with the pair, who were formally invited by email a month ago and missed the deadline for a response, which passed last week.\n\nBut the announcement that Harry will attend the ceremony, without Meghan, is just as likely to “fuel the narrative that difficulties between the couple and the palace remain very real, with some undoubtedly interpreting Meghan’s decision to stay away as a snub”.\n\nHarry’s solo trip could be down to a failure in negotiations, suggested royal historian and author Robert Lacey to the paper. With the invitation going out a month ago, “it seems the result of the best part of a month’s discussions and negotiations have not worked”.\n\nIngrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, suggested that Meghan’s non-attendance at the coronation is a “double insult” to her father-in-law who “walked her down the aisle in her hour of need” after her father, Thomas Markle, was too ill to attend her 2018 wedding. “I don’t think Meghan wanted to risk being sat in the hinterland at the Abbey,” she added.\n\nOmid Scobie, the royal commentator and author who is thought to be close to the couple and co-authored their biography Finding Freedom, tweeted: “I understand that Archie’s fourth birthday (also on May 6) played a factor in the couple’s decision. Expect it to be a fairly quick trip to the UK for Prince Harry, who will only be attending the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nYesterday’s announcement has finally put an end to months of speculation surrounding the highly anticipated event, allowing organisers to move forward with finalising arrangements. The Sun said it understood the seating plan had already been prepared and is now ready to be signed off.\n\nBut commentator Rob Jobson, author of the upcoming book Our King: Charles II – The Man and the Monarch Revealed, expressed doubt that Meghan will ever attend another official palace event.\n\nPraising Harry’s decision to attend the coronation as “the most pragmatic move in a difficult situation”, he also added that “the fact his wife is not attending means it is now highly unlikely we will ever see her attend an official or Palace event again – apart from maybe the King’s funeral”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/957026/the-pros-and-cons-of-a-total-smoking-ban", "title": "The pros and cons of a total smoking ban | The Week", "text": "Rishi Sunak's plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes appears to have gained cross-party backing, making a total smoking ban in the UK a real possibility.\n\nThe prime minister used his Conservative Party conference speech to announce plans to raise the age at which people can buy tobacco in England year by year until it applies to the whole population.

Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, stroke and heart disease, with smoking-related illnesses costing the NHS £17 billion a year, according to campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).\n\nAn independent government-commissioned review, which last year recommended proposals similar to those announced by Sunak, argued that tackling tobacco use and supporting smokers to quit would help prevent 15 types of cancer – including lung cancer, throat cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia. Recent data showed that one in four deaths from all cancers were estimated to be from smoking.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, the prime minister said his proposals represented the \"biggest public health intervention in a generation\", a claim backed up by England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, who stressed how beneficial the health improvements would be.\n\nCon: black markets\n\nSimon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, told the BBC that \"creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking\" but it will \"simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated\".\n\nThe illicit trade in tobacco products \"poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world\", according to the World Health Organization, which estimates 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit.\n\nWriting for The Conversation, Dr Brendan Gogarty, of the University of Tasmania, argued that \"laws that rely on prohibition to reduce the prevalence and harm from drugs generally fail to achieve their aims\".\n\nPro: avoiding poverty\n\nSmoking causes a disproportionate burden on the most disadvantaged families and communities, last year's independent review found. The average smoker in the North East of England spends over 10% of their income on tobacco, compared to just over 6% in the South East.\n\nThis mirrors research from 2015 conducted by University of Nottingham, which found parents who smoke were \"plunging nearly half a million children into poverty\", The Independent reported.\n\nAs smokers quit, said Sudyumna Dahal for The Conversation, household budgets \"become easier, facilitating what a study in the British Medical Journal describes as an income transfer from male smokers to females and other family members\".\n\nTherefore, argue anti-smoking campaigners, banning smoking would bring greater benefits to the less well-off.\n\nCon: risk to civil liberties\n\nSmokers and the groups who advocate on their behalf argue that their habit is a civil right, even if it kills the smoker. In a report published in 2019, the smokers’ group Forest argued that \"smokers are the canaries for civil liberties\".\n\nIt added that the call for a ban \"directly violates the harm principle that assumes a person has autonomy over their own life and body as long as they do not hurt other people\".\n\nAs The Spectator editor Fraser Nelson pointed out on Twitter, plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes could lead to the absurd situation where pensioners will have to produce ID to prove which side of the ever-moving line of legality they are on.\n\n\"I'd love to live in a smoke-free world,\" wrote Rachael Bletchly in the Daily Mirror. \"I wish people would stop wrecking their health with cigarettes. But I don't think it's the job of politicians to police other grown-ups' filthy habits. And I fear that Rishi Sunak's new smoking ban is just well-meaning, populist puff.\"\n\nPro: environmental protection\n\nCigarette smoking has several negative environmental impacts and banning smoking would bring these to an end. Smokers release pollution into the atmosphere, cigarette butts litter the environment, and the toxic chemicals in the residues cause soil and water pollution.\n\nTobacco is commonly planted in rainforest areas and has contributed to major deforestation, said Conserve Energy Future.\n\nA 2013 report in the journal Tobacco Control found that cigarette manufacturing “consumes scarce resources in growing, curing, rolling, flavouring, packaging, transport, advertising and legal defence” and “also causes harms from massive pesticide use”.\n\nCon: losing tax revenue\n\nTaxation on smoking raises more than £8.8 billion per year for the Treasury, noted Politics.co.uk. The TaxPayers’ Alliance rejected the argument that smokers also cost the taxman more due to their health burden, arguing that smokers who suffer major health problems are more likely to die prematurely, reducing expenditure on state pensions and other age-related benefits.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Jamie Timson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/953342/is-afghanistan-on-road-to-civil-war-us-troops-leave", "title": "Will US withdrawal from Afghanistan trigger civil war? - Taliban ...", "text": "The commander of the US mission in Afghanistan has warned that the withdrawal of international troops over the coming weeks threatens to plunge the country back into civil conflict.\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) reports that during “a rare news conference” at the headquarters of the US and Nato command in Kabul, General Austin S.

Once completed, the only military presence remaining in Afghanistan will reportedly be “around 650 troops” left “to protect diplomats at the US embassy and potentially assist in securing Kabul airport”.\n\nGeneral Miller told this week’s press conference that from a “military standpoint”, the departure is “going very well”.\n\nHowever, intelligence estimates are that “the Afghan government could fall in six months to two years after a final American withdrawal”, says the NYT.\n\nIn recent days, “Taliban fighters have overrun parts of three provinces, all just short drives from Kabul on highways running north and south”, The Washington Post reports. The insurgents have also “attacked security posts in a third area that hugs the city’s western border”, adds the paper.\n\nCiting the accelerating loss of territory amid a “countrywide offensive” by the Taliban, Miller warned that “the security situation is not good”, adding: “There are a lot of questions about why and how this is happening.”\n\nA UN report published at the start of June said that up to 500 al-Qaeda fighters were also believed to be in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintained a close relationship with the fellow Islamist extremist group.\n\nThese ties have prompted fears that an emboldened Taliban could provide “al-Qaeda space in which to rebuild and plan new attacks on US and other targets”, says Reuters.\n\nBlunted defences\n\nAs the withdrawal speeds ahead, images are emerging showing “Bagram airfield, once the heart of American military power in Afghanistan, being packed up by US forces”, The Times reports. “Often compared to a small city”, the base “will be taken over by the Afghan military to help them combat the chaos that is expected to follow”, says the paper.\n\nThe departure of Nato troops is also gathering pace, with the German Defence Ministry this week announcing the completion of its withdrawal of 1,100 troops that had been operating within the military alliance’s 9,600-strong training and support mission.\n\nBagram Airfield in northeastern Afghanistan (Image credit: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images)\n\nFor months, Pentagon chiefs have “argued for some sort of lasting American military presence in Afghanistan”, warning Biden of “counterterrorism concerns and the need to provide a check on the Taliban’s advance”, the NYT says. But the president has remained steadfast in his belief that the US’s longest war must come to a complete end.\n\n*Although the US military is “still providing what support it can to the Afghan security forces”, the paper continues, most “high-tech American communications equipment” has been removed, hindering efforts to continue responding to threats.\n\nAn unnamed official told the NYT that in at least one instance, bomber jets were unable to communicate to carry out an air strike on Taliban positions, forcing command to attack with an armed drone instead.\n\nExperts estimate that the Taliban already controls “as many as 140 of the country’s 370 districts and are active or influential in 170 others”, The Washington Post reports. And although peace talks are ongoing between the insurgents and the government, “more districts continue to fall to the Taliban almost daily”, in “violent clashes” or “peaceful surrenders”.\n\nRahmatullah Nabil, a former national intelligence director, told the paper that the Taliban’s tactic is to “surround” Kabul and other provincial capitals, “pushing closer and closer from all sides until they can stop, just short of entering Kabul, and say they are now ready to talk about peace”.\n\nTaliban insurgents have also begun seizing other strategic targets including areas along the border with Pakistan and key mineral mines and dams - prompting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan to add his voice to the growing chorus of warnings about a potential full-blown civil conflict.\n\nKhan told US news platform Axios that “there must be a settlement” before US troops leave his country’s northwestern neighbour, to prevent the Taliban going “for an all-out victory” that would cause “an incredible amount of bloodshed”.\n\nPakistan would also “suffer” as a result of this “civil war”, Khan said, adding: “A political settlement in Afghanistan would mean a sort of coalition government. A government from the Taliban side and the other side. There is no other solution.”\n\nHistory repeated\n\nWith the insurgents continuing to seize key targets, the “domino effect of falling districts has only served to demoralise the Afghan security forces”, the NYT says.\n\nMany have seen “comrades surrender, forfeiting their vehicles and equipment to an increasingly triumphant Taliban”, evoking memories of “the civil war in the 1990s” that saw “warlords and their fiefs of armed men” harass Afghans “to the point where the Taliban’s rise was welcome”.\n\nSurrendering Taliban insurgents pictured in 2004 (Image credit: Majid Saeedi/Getty Images)\n\nPakistani journalist Zahid Hussain predicts a repeat of those dark days, “when several mujahideen groups fought each other, plunging Afghanistan into a devastating civil war and killing thousands of Afghans”.\n\nIn an article in Pakistani newspaper Dawn, he recalls how “those events saw the rise of the Taliban movement” - and warns that the “withdrawal of the foreign forces and the looming threat of a Taliban takeover” has “compelled” militias to raise their own forces again.\n\nAlthough Biden has assured Afghan’s President Ashraf Ghani of “continued US financial, political and moral support, that may not be able to save Afghanistan from the looming civil war”, Hussain writes. And “it could be an unending war with no winner”.\n\nAt a White House press conference following talks with Ghani in Washington D.C. last week, Biden told a press conference that the “Afghans are going to have to decide their future, what they want”, adding: “The senseless violence has to stop.”\n\nBut “the violence is unlikely to come to a halt any time soon”, says the NYT, with peace talks in Doha stalled and “the insurgents’ gains on the battlefield” suggesting that “the Taliban is increasingly likely to only settle for an outright military victory”.\n\nAs commander of the US mission on the ground, General Miller knows the situation better than most. And his assessment is “bluntly pessimistic”, adds The Washington Post.\n\nThe war may be ending for the US, the paper continues, but Miller and other military chiefs fear that Afghanistan will “spiral into a state of violence”, triggering “a multifactional civil war” and a return to “old ethnic vendettas and abusive battlefield behaviour”.", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/13"}]}

He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/india/rishi-sunak-india-british-ties-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What do Indians think about Rishi Sunak's rise?

But 75 years since the end of the British Raj, many Indian commentators gleefully pointed out how times have changed.\n\n“Indian son rises over the empire.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it.

But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/uk/uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Rishi Sunak pledges to fix Truss' 'mistakes' after becoming third UK ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nRishi Sunak officially became Britain’s third prime minister in seven weeks on Tuesday, acknowledging that “mistakes were made” by his predecessor as he sought to bring stability to the UK after months of political and economic turmoil.\n\nHe was appointed by King Charles III at Buckingham Palace in London shortly after Liz Truss tendered her resignation to the monarch following a shambolic 50-day tenure which shook Britain’s economy to its core.\n\nSunak becomes the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead Britain after winning a fast-tracked Conservative Party leadership contest on Monday. At 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nAfter being invited to form a government by the King, Sunak returned to Downing Street where he made a speech aimed at alleviating some of the concerns of the public and laying out aspects of what his premiership will look like.\n\nIn his first speech as Britain’s new prime minister, Sunak said the nation was in “profound economic crisis,” before paying tribute to Truss.\n\n“I admired her restlessness to create change. But some mistakes were made. Not borne of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite in fact, but mistakes nonetheless,” he said. “And I have been elected as leader of my party, and your prime minister in part, to fix them. And that work begins immediately.”\n\nKing Charles III appointed Sunak as prime minister and invited him to form a new government on Tuesday. Aaron Chown/AP\n\nSunak highlighted his experience as finance minister during the pandemic to illustrate how he intends to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\n“You saw me during Covid doing everything I could to protect people and businesses, with schemes like furlough. There are always limits, more so now than ever. But I promise you this: I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today,” he said.\n\n“The government that I lead will not leave the next generation – your children and grandchildren – with a debt to settle that we were too weak to pay ourselves. I will unite our country, not with words but with action.”\n\nSunak added: “I will work day in and day out to deliver for you. This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Truss delivered her outgoing speech at the Downing Street podium before making the short car journey to Buckingham Palace.\n\nDespite a disastrous tenure which saw her become Britain’s shortest serving prime minister in history, Truss appeared full of confidence and smiling, as she called her time in office a “huge honor,” later adding that “brighter days lie ahead.”\n\n“We simply cannot afford to be a low growth country where the government takes up an increasing share of our national wealth, and where there are huge divides between different parts of our country,” Truss said on the economy. “We need to take advantage of our Brexit freedoms to do things differently. This means delivering more freedom for our own citizens and restoring power to democratic institutions.”\n\nTruss concluded by wishing Sunak “every success for the good of our country.”\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTuesday afternoon saw Sunak begin to form his new cabinet, bringing back lawmaker Dominic Raab as deputy prime minister, justice secretary and lord chancellor, and keeping Jeremy Hunt in the role of UK finance minister.\n\nHunt was appointed as chancellor earlier this month after Truss sacked his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng. Hunt subsequently reverted most of Kwarteng’s main policies proposed in September’s controversial “mini-budget.”\n\nSunak brought Suella Braverman back as Home Secretary, a role she resigned from last week under Truss’s government, hastening the end of the former Prime Minister’s term. James Cleverly and Ben Wallace will remain in their roles of Britain’s foreign secretary and defence secretary, respectively.\n\nChallenges ahead for new PM\n\nTuesday’s developments are a stunning turnaround for the man whose resignation as finance minister was instrumental in bringing down Boris Johnson’s government earlier this year, but then lost the summer leadership race. At that point, it appeared Sunak’s ambitions for the highest political role in the country were over.\n\nAnd yet, when Truss’ premiership imploded last week, Sunak quickly became a frontrunner to take over the party once more. Now in the top job, he faces an overflowing in-tray of challenges to steer the country out of crisis.\n\nHis own party is divided and has lost ground to the opposition Labour party in opinion polls following four months of political mayhem and financial market chaos. At the same time, Britain is facing major economic crisis, with many economists believing it is already in recession.\n\nHe is already under intense fire from opposition politicians, who are calling for a general election.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer congratulated Sunak on becoming the first British-Asian prime minister on Tuesday, but reiterated calls for a public vote.\n\n“The Tories have crashed the economy, with low wages, high prices and a cost of living crisis. The public needs a fresh start and a say on Britain’s future,” Starmer said.\n\nSunak, like Truss, has not had to win a general election to become prime minister because the Conservatives are still the largest party in the House of Commons, therefore their leader automatically becomes prime minister.\n\nIt’s not unusual for a prime minister to come into office without an election – four of the last five British prime ministers first entered the role without a general election. But the fact that Sunak is the UK’s third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 and the second to come into power without a public vote adds to the pressure.\n\nAccording to the law, the next general election must happen no later than in January 2025. With Labour way ahead in opinion polls, it is very unlikely he will take that step.\n\nSunak is under no obligation to call a vote and appeared to rule out the possibility in his Downing Street address when he said that he’d “always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements.”\n\nHe added: “I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual. It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us.”\n\nJohnson later offered his congratulations to the new prime minister in a post on Twitter, calling his appointment a “historic day.”\n\n“This is the moment for every Conservative to give our new PM their full and wholehearted support,” Johnson said.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Ivana Kottasová", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/africa/google-equiano-subsea-internet-cable-west-africa-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "Google Equiano: Internet giant bets big on Africa with latest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn July 1, a cable emerged from the Atlantic Ocean in Swakopmund, a small coastal city in western Namibia. Mostly known as a seaside resort, Swakopmund is used to visitors. But the giant ship out at sea, the string of buoys, and a fleet of smaller vessels manned by workers in hard hats and fluorescent bibs was an arrival of a different kind.\n\nRunning for thousands of miles along the bottom of the sea, the cable’s landing had been delayed for months by rough conditions and Covid-19. But now here it was, a couple of inches wide and already covered in sand. A welcome party stood on the beach and posed for photos before the cable continued inland. Equiano had finally arrived.\n\nEquiano is the latest subsea internet cable financed by Google. Starting in Portugal and eventually ending in South Africa, with branches to Nigeria, Togo, the islands of St Helena, and Namibia, the 15,000-kilometer (9,320-mile) cable is designed to deliver high-speed broadband along the west coast of Africa. Its capacity, a whopping 144 terabits per second, is 20 times that of the previous cable serving the region and could increase internet speeds more than fivefold in some countries.\n\nNamed after the Nigerian-born 18th century writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, the cable could prove life changing for some.\n\nBarney Harmse was among those on the beach in Swakopmund when the cable landed. He is the CEO of telecommunication company Paratus Group, which worked alongside Telecom Namibia to deliver the country’s 500-kilometer branch of the cable. “We’re excited as hell, I must say,” he told CNN prior to the landing. “It’s going to have an enormous impact on our part of the world.”\n\nClosing the digital divide\n\nTelecommunications has come a long way since the first subsea telegraph cable in 1858. As of 2021 there were over 1.3 million kilometers of subsea cable around the world, carrying over 95% of intercontinental internet traffic. But internet access is still highly uneven. In sub-Saharan Africa, internet use is the lowest of any region in the world, broadband coverage is significantly lower than global averages, and high data costs have proved a barrier to adoption, according to the World Bank.\n\nTo provide universal good quality, affordable broadband across Africa by 2030 would cost an estimated $109 billion, according to the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development. The economic impact of that investment would be profound. Fewer than 25% of Africans use the internet, but if the percentage was raised to 75% (roughly the same as Cuba or Moldova) it could increase job creation by nine percent, it says.\n\nGoogle will not disclose the total value of its investment in Equiano, but Paratus said the deal between Google, Telecom Namibia and itself was valued at 300 million Namibian dollars ($20 million). In October 2021, Google said it would invest $1 billion in Africa’s digital transformation, including connectivity and investments in startups.\n\nParatus Group CEO Barney Harmse poses with the Namibian branch of Equiano on July 1, 2022. courtesy Desert Pearl Photography/Paratus\n\nThe cable is scheduled to start carrying traffic at the beginning of 2023, says Paratus. According to a report commissioned by Google, Equiano will cause data prices to drop between 16% and 21% in South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria, and in the latter could lead to the creation of 1.6 million jobs, driven by the expansion of the digital economy and peripheral sectors.\n\n“With increased internet access, societies can modernize, people can acquire new skills and knowledge that can open doors to new job opportunities, and businesses and governments can increase productivity and uncover new revenue streams as a result of digital transformation,” said Bikash Koley, Google vice president of global networking, in a statement to CNN.\n\nAccess does not stop at coastal nations. Harmse says Paratus will connect the Namibian branch of Equiano to its network that spans Angola, Zambia, Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These countries will “experience an immediate benefit” when the cable comes online, he says.\n\n“We are investing daily to increase infrastructure and capacity going into our landlocked neighbors,” Harmse adds. “It’s not a single project with a specific start and stop (point) … it’s like a beast – an organism that you need to keep on feeding.”\n\nSome of the beneficiaries of that expansion are students. Paratus says it has installed internet connections in educational facilities collectively teaching over 10,000 students in Namibia as part of the EduVision program, which provides smartboards and e-learning technology to schools, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe race to connect\n\nThere are more cables to come – work is underway on 2Africa, a 45,000-kilometer subsea cable encircling the African continent and connected to Europe and Asia, funded by a consortium led by Meta (formerly Facebook). The cable landed in Genoa, Italy in April and in Djibouti in May.\n\n2Africa, a 45,000-kilometer (28,000-mile) subsea cable that will encircle Africa and connect to Europe and Asia, landed in Genoa, Italy earlier this year. courtesy Meta\n\nThe continent will need both cables and more as internet use grows, and older cables become obsolete or reach the end of their operational lifetime.\n\nAlan Mauldin, research director at telecoms market research firm TeleGeography, says demand for international bandwidth in Africa tripled between 2018 and 2021, and that by 2028, demand will be 16 times greater than it was last year.\n\nWhile intercontinental cables will continue to play a significant role in Africa’s internet future, so too will homegrown data centers. Storing more of the internet’s data in Africa and positioning data centers closer to end users will speed up response time and decreases data costs, explains Harmse. “It’s the next big thing,” he says, adding that Paratus’ latest data center, an $8 million project in Namibia’s capital Windhoek, will be completed in August.\n\nIn the meantime, Equiano continues its journey towards South Africa, its final destination, while engineers work to link its branches to Western Africa’s ever-growing network.\n\n“The race is on,” says Harmse. “Africa is the continent to connect.”", "authors": ["Tom Page"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-resignation-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: UK Prime Minister resigns after mutiny in his party ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBoris Johnson’s turbulent tenure as Britain’s Prime Minister came to an end Thursday after a historic party revolt over a series of ethics scandals forced him to step down.\n\nIt took the resignation of nearly 60 members of his government – almost half the payroll – for Johnson to finally abandon his attempts to cling on to power. Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/business/new-mms-character/index.html", "title": "M&M'S is adding a new character | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nEarlier this year, Mars shocked the internet when it unveiled new looks for its M&M’S characters. Gone were Green’s iconic go-go boots, replaced by sneakers. Online, mayhem ensued.\n\nNow, M&M’S is making another, bigger change — this time, it’s adding a brand new character to the mix. Meet Purple: She’s peanut, she sings, and she doesn’t wear high heels (she sports lace-up boots).\n\nThe purple peanut M&M is the first new character in 10 years, according to the brand.\n\n“Purple has been in the works for a very long time, for years,” said Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M’S. “This was about ensuring that the entire crew, the entire cast of spokescandies, were reflecting the world that we’re living in.”\n\nM&M'S\n\nPurple has a specific personality — quirky, confident and just a little awkward. Her debut comes with a song, “I’m Just Gonna Be Me,” which can be seen in a video online and streamed on platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that a purple M&M is coming to bags of Peanut M&M’S, however.\n\nThe new character will appear in stores, on the M&M’S website and on some limited edition packaging, said Hwang. And customers will be able to buy purple M&M’S online, an option that was already available. But when it comes to a regular bag of peanut M&M’S, purple fans are out of luck.\n\nThat could be a new source of outrage.\n\nIn the mid-90s, people voted for blue to replace tan in bags of the candy. In 2002, M&M’S once again asked people to vote, this time for a color that would be added for just a limited time. Purple won, but didn’t stick around for long.\n\nOnline, people frequently ask why there are no purple M&M’S. Some bemoan the missed opportunity in the 1990s to make purple a permanent addition to the lineup. Some even think the vote was rigged.\n\nStill, the new character, while not an actual new candy, is an acknowledgment from M&M’S that people are pining for purple.\n\n“We’ve heard for a long time that purple is certainly a consumer favorite,” said Hwang.\n\nBut the brand is really focusing on the characters, rather than the actual edible candies, she noted.\n\n‘Give green her boots back’\n\nWhen M&M’S made changes to its characters’ footwear early this year, the idea was to make them more current and relevant, with characters that, Mars hopes, will make people feel like they belong. The new footwear was supposed to help telegraph that message. Orange finally got a pair of shoes with tied laces, Brown got lower heels, and others also got subtle updates to their style.\n\nBut there was an outsized reaction to Green’s new kicks.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Washington Post declared “The M&M’S changes aren’t progressive. Give Green her boots back.” In a provocatively-headlined article, Rolling Stone described the change as “nothing more than tectonic.” Thousands have signed a petition to “keep the green M&M sexy.”\n\nPeople are known to have strong feelings about things online, particularly changes to beloved characters. When Lola Bunny got a new look for the new Space Jam movie, for example, fans were outraged.\n\nBut for M&M’S, reaction to the character makeover was “unprecedented,” said Hwang. “We were incredibly overwhelmed,” she noted. “Now we know for certain that M&M’S is a cultural icon.”\n\nSo when it came to the new purple character, Hwang said, M&M’S didn’t take the reaction to Green into account. Purple “had nothing to do … with the commentaries we saw about Green,” she said.\n\nAnd for now, at least, M&M’S has no plans to restore Green’s look.\n\n“The characters … are continuously evolving to reflect the times that we’re living in,” Hwang said, adding that the brand hopes consumers will “get to know our characters for much more than their footwear.”\n\nSo will the go-go boots ever make a comeback? Hwang answered slyly, “You never know.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/962228/frances-abaya-robe-ban-clothes-police", "title": "France's abaya robe ban in schools: overreach from the state? | The ...", "text": "The abaya has “no place in schools”, according to France’s education minister, announcing a ban on the loose, dress-like garment in state schools.\n\nThe clothing, popularly worn in many Gulf and Middle East countries, is “a religious gesture”, Gabriel Attal told French TV channel TF1. The ban, which will come into force at the start of the school year on 4 September, is in line with “laïcité” (secularism), a cornerstone of French policy, he said. “When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn’t be able to identify the pupil’s religion just by looking at them.”\n\nThe move comes after “months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools”, said France24. The right and far-right “pushed for the ban”, but many on the left argued it would “encroach on civil liberties”. The abaya robe is not “directly associated with Islam”, said Euronews, “as no text requires Muslim women to wear it”. Attal’s predecessor as education minister, Pap Ndiaye, “had ruled the abaya a grey area”, said The Times, “mixing cultural identity and religion”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The president “sends a signal to the right and divides the left”, but also “risks opening a Pandora’s box”.\n\n‘Obsessive rejection of Muslims’\n\nFrance has enforced a ban on religious symbols in state schools since 2004, including Islamic veils or hijabs, Jewish kippahs and large Catholic crosses. In 2010, the country banned full face-covering veils in public, “angering some in its five million-strong Muslim community”, said Sky News.\n\nBut the abaya “is a form of fashion”, not a religious symbol, said Abdallah Zekri, vice-president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. He was “surprised” that the abaya had “become a priority”, while teachers worried more about lack of funding and teachers.\n\nFrance is “hypersensitive to the visible displays of religiosity, especially when it comes to Islam”, Haoues Seniguer, an Islam specialist at the Institute of Political Studies in Lyon, told The National. This ban is “a perfect example of a storm in a teacup”, and “contributes to creating a sense of moral panic”. It is “shocking” and “sexist” that “women are being told by men how to dress”.\n\nThe ban is “unconstitutional” and anti-secular, said Clementine Autain, deputy of left-wing opposition party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed). It amounts to the “policing of clothing”, and reflects the government’s “obsessive rejection of Muslims”. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, party leader, said the return to school was being “politically polarised by a new absurd form of war of religion”.\n\nThis ban is “going to hurt Muslims in general”, sociologist Agnes De Feo told Reuters. “They will, once again, feel stigmatised.”\n\n‘A political attack’\n\nThe government spokesman Olivier Véran called the robes “a political attack”. They are an “obviously” religious symbol, he said: an attempt at “proselytising”, or converting people.\n\nUntil the start of this year, “my wife, a teacher in a state school in a deprived suburb of northern Paris”, said she had “never seen an abaya in her classroom”, wrote Gavin Mortimer for The Spectator. “Within weeks they became commonplace.” Although some are worn by body-conscious girls, “a way of concealing anxieties about their weight”, religion is “the main reason the abaya has taken off”. Its popularity spread on TikTok, “as part of a campaign aimed at challenging the Republic’s secularism”.\n\n“To dismiss the abaya as a mere ‘cultural’ fad ... is to deny that it is an expression of adherence to a political Islam that pursues a hegemonic goal,” wrote Jean-Éric Schoettl, former secretary general of France’s constitutional council, in Le Figaro.\n\nThe far-right National Rally – “which typically keeps its distance from the Macron administration” – saluted the move, said Politico. Socialist and communist parties also welcomed the ban, “in line with the parties’ secular past”.\n\nPublic opinion is “firmly on the side of keeping state schools secular,” wrote Caulcutt. According to a recent IFOP poll, 77% of French people are “opposed” to religious signs in secondary schools, with just under half the population “very opposed”.\n\n“We welcome it,” said Bruno Bobkiewicz, general secretary of the SNPDEN-UNSA union which represents head teachers. “The instructions were not clear, now they are.”", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-graham/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump calling Vladimir Putin a 'genius' was no ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn Wednesday, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham insisted that former President Donald Trump had made a “mistake” when he referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “genius” for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut a mistake implies that Trump did it once – unintentionally misspeaking in a way that didn’t represent his actual views.\n\nWhich is, um, not what Trump did.\n\nHere’s what Trump told conservative radio hosts Buck Sexton and Clay Travis last week: “I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine – of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.”\n\nThe day after he made those comments, he effectively doubled down on them. “They say, ‘Trump said Putin’s smart.’ I mean, he’s taking over a country for two dollars’ worth of sanctions,” Trump told a crowd at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, according to a recording of the event. “I’d say that’s pretty smart. He’s taking over a country – really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.”\n\nThen, in a speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, Trump, again, repeated his praise of Putin. “Yesterday reporters asked me if I thought President Putin was smart,” he said. “I said, ‘Of course, he’s smart,’ to which I was greeted with ‘Oh, that’s such a terrible thing to say.’” I like to tell them, ‘Yes, he’s smart.’”\n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times, well, I must be just plain clueless.\n\nAnd it’s not just these three times that Trump has praised Putin. Not even close!\n\nThere was the time on the campaign trail in 2016 when Trump said this: “The man has very strong control over a country. Now, it’s a very different system and I don’t happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he’s been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.”\n\nOr that time in 2017 when Fox’s Bill O’Reilly called Putin a “killer” and Trump responded: “There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent? Do you think our country is so innocent?”\n\nOr that time in 2018 when, after meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump took the Russian president’s side on the issue of meddling in the 2016 election. “I think that the United States has been foolish,” Trump said. “We’ve all been foolish. We’re all to blame.”\n\n(If you want more – and there is a LOT more – check out this KFILE timeline of Trump’s past laudatory quotes about Putin.)\n\nSee, the thing is, Trump’s praise for Putin is a feature, not a bug. He has long admired Putin’s strongman tendencies and the power he exerts over his people.\n\nWhich means you shouldn’t buy what Graham is selling here.

Trump’s praise for Putin’s invasion doesn’t fit that bill.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/fact-check-biden-midterms-2022/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Biden's midterms message includes false and ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been back on the campaign trail, traveling in October and early November to deliver his pitch for electing Democrats in the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nBiden’s pitch has included claims that are false, misleading or lacking important context. (As always, we take no position on the accuracy of his subjective arguments.) Here is a fact-check look at nine of his recent statements.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nSocial Security, part 1\n\nBiden said at a Democratic fundraiser in Pennsylvania last week: “On our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are going to get the biggest increase in their Social Security checks they’ve gotten.” He has also touted the 2023 increase in Social Security payments at other recent events.\n\nBut Biden’s boasts leave out such critical context that they are highly misleading. He hasn’t explained that the increase in Social Security payments for 2023, 8.7%, is unusually big simply because the inflation rate has been unusually big. A law passed in the 1970s says that Social Security payments must be increased by the same percentage that a certain measure of inflation has increased. It’s called a cost-of-living adjustment.\n\nThe White House deleted a Tuesday tweet that delivered an especially triumphant version of Biden’s boast, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged Wednesday that the tweet was lacking “context.” You can read a more detailed fact check here.\n\nSocial Security, part 2\n\nBiden said at a Democratic rally in Florida on Tuesday: “And on my watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting an increase in their Social Security checks.”\n\nThe claim that the 2023 increase to Social Security payments is the first in 10 years is false. In reality, there has been a cost-of-living increase every year from 2017 onward. There was also an increase every year from 2012 through 2015 before the payment level was kept flat in 2016 because of a lack of inflation.\n\nThe context around this Biden remark in Florida suggests he might have botched his repeat campaign line about Social Security payments increasing at the same time as Medicare premiums are declining. Regardless of his intentions, though, he was wrong.\n\nA new corporate tax\n\nBiden repeatedly suggested in speeches in October and early November that a new law he signed in August, the Inflation Reduction Act, will stop the practice of successful corporations paying no federal corporate income tax. Biden made the claim explicitly in a tweet last week: “Let me give you the facts. In 2020, 55 corporations made $40 billion. And they paid zero in federal taxes. My Inflation Reduction Act puts an end to this.”\n\nBut “puts an end to this” is an exaggeration. The Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of companies on the list of non-payers, but the law will not eliminate the list entirely.\n\nThat’s because the law’s new 15% alternative corporate minimum tax, on the “book income” companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. (There are lots of nuances; you can read more specifics here.) According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the think tank that in 2021 published the list of 55 large and profitable companies that avoided paying any federal income tax in their previous fiscal year, only 14 of these 55 companies reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion in that year.\n\nIn other words, there will clearly still be some large and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax even after the minimum tax takes effect in 2023. The exact number is not yet known.\n\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said in a Thursday email that the new tax is “an important step forward from the status quo” and that it will raise substantial revenue, but he also said: “I wouldn’t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.”\n\nThe debt and the deficit\n\nBiden said at the Tuesday rally in Florida: “Look, you know, you can hear it from Republicans, ‘My God, that big-spending Democrat Biden. Man, he’s taken us in debt.’ Well, guess what? I reduced the federal deficit this year by $1 trillion $400 billion. One trillion 400 billion dollars. The most in all American history. No one has ever reduced the debt that much. We cut the federal debt in half.”\n\nBiden offered a similar narrative at a Thursday rally in New Mexico, this time saying, “We cut the federal debt in half. A fact.”\n\nThere are two significant problems here.\n\nFirst: Biden conflated the debt and the deficit, which are two different things. It’s not true that Biden has “cut the federal debt in half”; the federal debt (total borrowing plus interest owed) has continued to rise under Biden, exceeding $31 trillion for the first time this October. Rather, it’s the federal deficit – the annual difference between spending and revenue – that was cut in half between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\n\nSecond, it’s highly questionable how much credit Biden deserves for even the reduction in the deficit. Biden doesn’t mention that the primary reason the deficit plummeted in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 was that it had skyrocketed to a record high in 2020 because of emergency pandemic relief spending. It then fell as expected as the spending expired as planned.\n\nDan White, senior director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics – an economics firm whose assessments Biden has repeatedly cited during his presidency – told CNN’s Matt Egan in October: “On net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, says the administration’s own actions have significantly worsened the deficit picture. (David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told Egan that the Biden administration does deserve credit for the economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues.)\n\nThe unemployment rate\n\nBiden said at the Florida rally on Tuesday: “Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5%, the lowest in 50 years.” He said at the New Mexico rally on Thursday: “Unemployment rate is 3.5% – the lowest it’s been in 50 years.”\n\nBut Biden didn’t acknowledge that September’s 3.5% unemployment rate was actually a tie for the lowest in 50 years – a tie, specifically, with three months of Trump’s administration, in late 2019 and early 2020. Since Biden uses these campaign speeches to favorably compare his own record to Trump’s record, that omission is significant.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in October; that number was revealed on Friday, after these Biden comments. The rate was 6.4% in January 2021, the month Biden took office.\n\nBiden’s student debt policy\n\nDuring an on-camera discussion conducted by progressive organization NowThis News and published online in late October, Biden told young activists that they “probably are aware, I just signed a law” on student debt forgiveness that is being challenged by Republicans. He added: “It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two, and it’s in effect.”\n\nBiden’s claims are false.\n\nHe created his student debt forgiveness initiative through executive action, not through legislation, so he didn’t sign a law and didn’t get it passed by any margin. Since Republicans opposed to the initiative, including those challenging the initiative in court, have called it unlawful precisely because it wasn’t passed by Congress, the distinction between a law and an executive action is a highly pertinent fact here.\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, the law narrowly passed by the Senate in August; the official said the Inflation Reduction Act created “room for other crucial programs” by bringing down the deficit. But Biden certainly did not make it clear that he was talking about anything other than the student debt initiative.\n\nGas prices\n\nBiden correctly noted on various occasions in October that gas prices have declined substantially since their June 2022 peak – though, as always, it’s important to note that presidents have a limited impact on gas prices. But in an economic speech in New York last week, Biden said, “Today, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39 – down from over $5 when I took office.”\n\nBiden’s claim that the most common gas price when he took office was more than $5 is not even close to accurate. The most common price for a gallon of regular gas on the day he was inaugurated, January 20, 2021, was $2.39, according to data provided to CNN by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. In other words, Biden made it sound like gas prices had fallen significantly during his presidency when they had actually increased significantly.\n\nIn other recent remarks, Biden has discussed the state of gas prices in relation to the summer peak of more than $5 per gallon, not in relation to when he took office. Regardless, the comment last week was the second this fall in which Biden inaccurately described the price of gas – both times in a way that made it sound more impressive.\n\nYou can read a longer fact check here.\n\nBiden and Xi\n\nBiden has revived a claim that was debunked more than 20 months ago by The Washington Post and then CNN. At least twice in October, he boasted that he traveled 17,000 miles with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n“I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping of China than any world leader has, when I was Vice President all the way through to now. Over 78 hours with him alone. Eight – nine of those hours on the phone and the others in person, traveling 17,000 miles with him around the world, in China and the United States,” he told a Democratic gathering in Oregon in mid-October.\n\nBiden made the number even bigger during a speech on student debt in New Mexico on Thursday, saying, “I traveled 17-, 18,000 miles with him.”\n\nThe claim is false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that the two men often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of his flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which, obviously, Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with” Xi as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of a boast about how well he knows Xi – and Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts\n\nBiden claimed at the Thursday rally in New Mexico that under Trump, Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax cut that “affected only the top 1% of the American public.”\n\nBiden correctly said in various October remarks that the Trump tax cut law was particularly beneficial to the wealthy, but he went too far here. It’s not true that the Trump policy “only” affected the top 1%.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center think tank found in early 2018 that Trump’s law “will reduce individual income taxes on average for all income groups and in all states.” The think tank estimated that “between 60 and 76 percent of taxpayers in every state will receive a tax cut.” And in April 2019, tax-preparation company H&R Block said two-thirds of its returning customers had indeed paid less in tax that year than they did the year prior, The New York Times reported in an article headlined “Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut.”\n\nThe Tax Policy Center did find in early 2018 that people at the top would get by far the biggest benefits from Trump’s law. Specifically, the think tank found that the top 1% of earners would get an average 3.4% increase in after-tax 2018 income – versus an average 1.6% income increase for people in the middle quintile, an average 1.2% income increase for people in the quintile below that and just an average 0.4% income increase for people in the lowest quintile. The think tank also found that the top 1% of earners would get more than 20% of the income benefits from the law, a bigger share than the bottom 60% of earners combined.\n\nThe distribution could get even more skewed after 2025, when the law’s individual tax cuts will expire if not extended by Congress and the president. If there is no extension – and, therefore, the law’s permanent corporate tax cut remains in place without the individual tax cuts – the Tax Policy Center has estimated that, in 2027, the top 1% will get 83% of the benefits from the law.\n\nBut that’s a possibility about the future. Biden claimed, in the past tense, that the law “affected” only the top 1%. That’s inaccurate.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Biden overstated his point about the Trump tax cuts. The Washington Post fact-checked him in 2019, for example, when he claimed “all of it” went to the ultra-rich and corporations.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}]}

That equates to about 1.7 cups daily for everyone in the U.S., or 2.8 cups daily per coffee drinker, amounts which have remained steady since 2020, the group says.\n\nThe U.S. imports the most coffee and is expected to import 20% of the world's volume of coffee in 2023-2024 (about 28.3 million bags, compared to 47.5 million in the European Union), the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.\n\nBut the U.S. doesn't even rank among the top ten countries in terms of per capita coffee consumption (324 cups per capita), falling far below Lebanon, which is No. 1 at 1,516 cups annually, according to research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nMany drink coffee for its caffeine content to help them wake up and remain alert; the Food and Drug Administration says healthy adults can have 4-5 cups daily and stay within the recommended caffeine limit of 400 milligrams a day. But think about the size of your cup: a 16-ounce cup of Starbucks coffee can have 260-360 mg of caffeine, depending on the roast; while a 14-ounce cup of Dunkin' Coffee has 210 mg, according to Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nMedical research has also suggested that moderate coffee intake (2-5 cups daily) coffee could help you live longer and help prevent some diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, heart disease and depression, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people with panic or anxiety disorders, research suggests.\n\nCoffee drinkers, over the last year, have increased spending on dry coffee, to brew at home, up 6.5%, while spending at Starbucks and other limited service restaurants is down 4.6%, during the 52-week period ending May 31, 2023, according to market research firm Numerator.\n\n\"Since the pandemic we have seen more consumers upleveling their coffee experience at home,\" Starbucks Coffee developer Leslie Wolford told USA TODAY. \"There are a lot of choices and a myriad of ways to enjoy coffee.\"\n\nTo get you to come have coffee at their place, many spots pouring, brewing and steaming coffee and coffee drinks have deals and specials for National Coffee Day on Friday, Sept. 29, and over the subsequent days including International Coffee Day on Sunday, Oct. 1.\n\nCoffee with sugar:Morning cup can be good for your health and help you live longer, study suggests\n\nCheese lovers rejoice:The CurderBurger is coming back to Culver's menu for a limited time\n\nDunkin' has free coffee on National Coffee Day\n\nDunkin’ Rewards members can get a free medium iced or hot coffee with any purchase Friday.

The Argentina captain scored an early penalty to put his side in the lead, but two second-half goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al Dawsari turned the game on its head.\n\nThe thousands of Saudi fans inside the Lusail Stadium couldn’t believe what they were watching as they celebrated their unexpected victory.\n\nSuch a comeback hadn’t looked remotely possible for much of the match. Argentina controlled the game after taking the lead but whatever Saudi manger Hervé Renard said at halftime worked. His team came out with a new-found belief and stood toe-to-toe with Argentina’s world-class team.\n\nSaudi Arabia players celebrate their shock win. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAl Dawsari’s incredible winner from distance – and subsequent acrobatic celebration – will become one of the moments of this or any World Cup and undoubtedly, in time, an ‘I-was-there’ moment for fans.\n\nAs full-time neared, fans cheered every tackle and save as if they were goals and, when the match did indeed end, Saudi Arabia fans reacted with frenzy.\n\nBoth sets of players sunk to their knees, from disbelief and exhaustion. Messi, who so many had come see play, looked distraught as he walked off with Saudi fans cheering his name ironically.\n\nAccording to sports data group Gracenote, which is a Nielsen company, Tuesday’s result was the biggest upset in the history of the competition.\n\n“The most surprising World Cup win ever according to Gracenote was USA’s victory over England in 1950 with a 9.5% chance of victory for the US team but Saudi Arabia’s chance of victory today was estimated at 8.7% so takes over at number one,” it said in a statement.\n\nAs much as this was a historic win for Saudi Arabia, it was a humiliating defeat for Argentina who capitulated on the biggest stage.\n\nSaudi players smiled and laughed with reporters as they left the stadium, a stark contrast to the Argentine squad who walked with their heads down onto the team bus. Messi was one of the few to stop and speak to journalists and even stopped for photos.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

At recess, all the playground talk revolved around comparisons of the loot in our stockings, and we would go home in the afternoon to gorge ourselves on red and green M&Ms, and try to crack the walnuts that we had only once a year. (I will admit, the oranges usually stayed at the bottom of our stockings to rot.)\n\nMy husband, who also grew up on the south side of Milwaukee, had similar stories to share with me when we met, and when we got married and started our own family, we inevitably continued the tradition, and our own daughters look forward to the holiday as much as we did.\n\nSo, when I started working at the Journal Sentinel, you can imagine how shocked I was to find out that St. Nick's isn't a thing everywhere. It's not even a thing everywhere in Wisconsin.\n\nKathie Devlin, who also celebrated St. Nick's growing up in West Allis, discovered that St. Nick's Day wasn't a thing for everyone long before I did. \"When I was in grade school at St Aloysius, we went around to all the different classrooms to learn how different countries celebrated,\" she said. She learned about Dutch people leaving out their wooden shoes, that oranges are a popular treat because they represent the gold St. Nicholas gave away when he became a bishop. And she learned that in the United States, the celebration of St. Nick's is a very German holiday, which is predominantly celebrated in cities with an especially German population — like Milwaukee.\n\nWhen I asked other Milwaukee-area parents how they celebrate the day, I got peppered with a lot of happy childhood memories of stockings full of oranges, candy, nuts and little toys. And I heard from parents who got married to spouses who weren't from around here, and, although baffled by their significant others' enthusiasm for the \"holiday,\" agreed to play along for their own children.\n\nI also learned that, although there are certain commonalities in the way the holiday is celebrated, each family has its own twists and quirks in its traditions.\n\nSt. Nick is flexible\n\nFull disclosure: I was well-acquainted with St. Nick's flexibility even before talking to other families. My own daughters, upon getting old enough to go to school, balked at the idea of waking up on St. Nick's morning, unloading a stocking full of treats and then having to leave them behind so they could go to school. When Dec. 6 falls on a school day, they've politely asked St. Nick to deliver their goodies the weekend before his actual feast day so they can eat their candy and play with their toys all day to their hearts' content. And St. Nick has kindly complied.\n\nJust as he has for other families.\n\n\"My husband starts work at 6 in the morning, so he's always gone by the time the kids get up,\" said Jamie Gray, mom to two daughters. \"So, if Dec. 6 falls during the week, our St. Nick will make an early appearance, and I'll tell the girls, 'Oh, I guess he just knew it was a school day so he came early!' \"\n\nThe receptacle varies\n\nThe original tradition is that St. Nicholas would leave treats in the children's shoes or socks that were left by the fire. That tradition has evolved into buying or making stockings especially for the occasion, which seems to be what most families do.\n\nSome families still do the shoe thing, though. Doug Bertrand, who grew up in Green Bay and now lives in Merton with his family, said, \"The kids put their shoes by the fireplace at night, and there's an apple in one and an orange in the other when they wake up.\"\n\nAlthough his own kids enjoy leaving their shoes out, when he and his siblings were younger, their loot was delivered differently — in a big brown grocery store bag (which admittedly holds more).\n\nKids look forward to specific stocking-stuffers\n\nInterestingly, even though the trinkets and treats brought by St. Nick are different depending on the family, those stocking-stuffers are not something that can be altered. So St. Nick had better remember what he brings each family because the kids depend on the same things every year.\n\n\"My brother and sister and I had apples and oranges in our grocery store bags, plus magazines,\" said Bertrand. \"And, always, we had the big giant plastic candy canes filled with red and green M&Ms.\"\n\nBertrand's own kids, who are now 6 and 9, get just one apple and orange each, plus a few wooden toys, and they also look forward to the candy-filled plastic candy canes every year — although the Bertrand boys prefer Skittles in theirs.\n\nThe story behind the tradition differs\n\nFor families who celebrate St. Nick's, the explanation for his yearly visit usually relates to Christmas in some way. After all, St. Nicholas is basically Santa Claus, right?\n\nMy own kids see the festivities of St. Nick's as a great way to temper the long wait for Christmas Eve, a sentiment that was echoed over and over by the families I talked to who said their kids love that the tradition is the start of the holiday season.\n\nAnd, for some families, it's even more related to Christmas than that.\n\n\"When my kids asked who St. Nick is and why he comes each year, I told them it's Santa Claus doing a dry run before Christmas, for all those kids who just moved or he's not quite sure how their chimneys work,\" Bertrand said. Oh, and for the Bertrand family, St. Nick doesn't do the reindeer and sleigh thing because that's just for Christmas Eve. \"He wears a big green suit and rides a moose,\" Bertrand said, laughing.\n\nAnother Christmas tradition that's related to St. Nick for some families? Elf on the Shelf. \"For my kids, our elf on the shelf arrives with St. Nick,\" said Gray. \"Her name is Ellie, and the kids are always so excited that St. Nick brings her. She stays at our house and then goes back to the North Pole with Santa on Christmas Eve.\"\n\nWhatever St. Nick brings, however he arrives and whatever receptacle he chooses to fill with treats, Milwaukee-area families who celebrate his feast day are universally on-board with continuing the tradition. \"Every year, my son looks forward to St. Nick's even more than Christmas,\" Devlin said. \"I think it's because it's just the start of all the excitement of the Christmas season for him.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/football/usa-netherlands-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "USMNT knocked out of World Cup in round of 16 by clinical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) was defeated 3-1 by the Netherlands and knocked out of the World Cup in the round of 16, despite a spirited performance.\n\nThe Netherlands had been underwhelming during the group stages but showcased its quality and clinical edge on Saturday, with three well-taken goals from Memphis Depay, Daley Blind and Denzel Dumfries.\n\nHaji Wright pulled one back for the USMNT late in the second half with his team trailing 2-1, but any comeback hopes were snuffed out by Dumfries’ 81st minute goal to all but confirm the Dutch victory.\n\nUS President Biden expressed pride in the USMNT’s performance in the World Cup following the team’s defeat , making a nod to the next World Cup in 2026, which will be held in the US as well as Canada and Mexico.\n\n“Fellas, you made us proud. We get up and keep going,” Biden tweeted. “Here’s to a bright future and 2026 back here at home.”\n\nThe USMNT have only reached the quarterfinals once since 1934 -- in 2002. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nDutch delight\n\nThe USMNT had more shots on goal than the Netherlands but once again, the lack of a proven goalscorer proved costly for Gregg Berhalter’s young team.\n\nThis was the USMNT’s youngest ever starting XI for a World Cup knockout match who lined up to face the Netherlands, aiming to reach the quarterfinals for just the second time in the modern era.\n\nBerhalter’s side controlled the opening exchanges, finding space in behind the Dutch defense and Christian Pulisic had an early chance, going one-on-one with Oranje goalkeeper Andries Noppert who deflected the Chelsea forward’s shot away from goal.\n\nHaving soaked up that early pressure, the Netherlands then counterattacked with lethal precision.\n\nAfter carving through the USMNT midfield, Cody Gakpo found Dumfries on the edge of the box who pulled the ball back to Depay perfectly positioned in front of the goal. The Barcelona forward finished off a sweeping move, firing the ball into the net.\n\nThe USMNT continued to press – a strike from Timothy Weah was batted away by Noppert and Sergiño Dest went on several mazy runs – but just could not find a way past the Dutch defense.\n\nAnd then, on the stroke of halftime, the Netherlands doubled its lead as Blind rifled in Dumfries’ cross in an almost identical move to its first goal.\n\nImmediately after the break, the USMNT almost pulled a goal back as the ball bobbled about in the box from a corner and Tim Ream guided it inches from the goal-line but the Netherlands cleared.\n\nUSMNT goalkeeper Matt Turner prrevent an almost certain goal as he made a double save, stopping two strikes in quick succession to keep his side’s fading hopes of reaching the quarterfinals alive.\n\nHis quick reflexes proved even more crucial minutes later when the USMNT finally scored as Wright latched onto Pulisic’s cross, with his effort looping over Noppert’s head.\n\nThe noise in the stadium, seemingly filled with American fans, briefly became deafening but just minutes later Dumfries hammered in Frenkie de Jong’s cross to confirm the Netherlands’ victory.\n\nWith that goal, Dumfries became the first Dutch player to be directly involved in more than three goals in a single World Cup match since 1978, according to the statistics website OptaJoe.\n\nUSMNT star Christian Pulisic said he was “really proud” of the team’s performances at the World Cup.\n\n“I hope we showed a lot of people what we can do,” Pulisic told FOX’s Jenny Taft. “We deserved more from this tournament. End of the day, we couldn’t get it done, but I think there’s a lot we can be proud of.\n\n“It hurts a lot right now,” added Pulisic. “We thought we could have advanced and done a lot more this time around, but I love these guys, and it’s a really special group that we have.”\n\nThe Netherlands now advances to the quarterfinals where it will face either Argentina or Australia on Friday.", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2023/07/26/usa-netherlands-womens-world-cup-live-updates/70465465007/", "title": "USWNT vs Netherlands highlights: Lindsey Horan header snags ...", "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Do not make Lindsey Horan mad.\n\nThe U.S. captain scored on a thunderous header after a collision with Lyon teammate Danielle van de Donk on Thursday, salvaging a 1-1 draw with the Netherlands and keeping the U.S. women’s national team's hopes of winning Group E alive.\n\nThe two-time defending champs can claim the top spot – and a road to the final that likely wouldn’t include England, Germany or France – by beating Portugal and maintaining their plus-2 goal differential against the Netherlands.\n\nThe Americans looked deflated after giving up a goal in the 17th minute, the first time since the 2011 quarterfinals they have trailed in a World Cup game. They appeared disorganized and tentative, showing none of the cohesion they had to start the game.\n\nBut a hard tackle by van de Donk early in the second half changed everything.\n\nHoran crumbled to the field and was down for several minutes. She was clearly angry when she finally got up. She had words with her Lyon teammate, and the two were pushing and shoving in the box after the USWNT was awarded a corner kick. Even the referee’s attempt to get the two to make nice didn’t calm Horan, who was still muttering when Rose Lavelle lined up in the corner.\n\nHoran got the last word.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nWhen does the USWNT play next?\n\nThe USWNT concludes group play next week vs. Portugal. The game will kickoff Tuesday at 3 a.m. ET in the U.S., which is 7 p.m. in Auckland, New Zealand. Bookmark our World Cup schedule hub so you don’t miss a game.\n\nUnited States vs. Portugal\n\nEven after getting only 1 point for a tie against Netherlands, the USWNT has an edge to win Group E because of goal differential. The U.S. won its opener against Vietnam 3-0, while the Dutch only beat Portugal 1-0.\n\nThat means Netherlands can only win the group by beating Vietnam in its next match and scoring three more goals than the USWNT scores against Portugal.\n\nThere can be no letting off the gas for the Americans.\n\nLindsey Horan World Cup goal vs. Netherlands\n\nMaybe the U.S. women should try to make Lindsey Horan mad before every game. That fight from Horan, and the resilience the young Americans had to show, could end up being a positive for the defending champions. A potentially defining moment, too.\n\n“I don’t think you ever want to get me mad, because I don’t react in a good way. Usually I just go and I want something more. I want to do more for my team and win these games,” Horan said. “We’re going to see more and more of this in the World Cup,” she added. “It’s great for us to have this in the group stage, to feel that kind of pressure and feel such a great opponent. So now we move forward. We learned a few lessons from this game and now we focus on Portugal.”\n\nThe USWNT is going to get pushed in the knockout rounds and is going to have to respond, and that isn’t something that can be taught in a video session or replicated in practice. It’s something that has to be experienced, so this game against the Netherlands was actually kind of perfect for the Americans.\n\nThe next challenge is for the USWNT to show this kind of grit from the opening whistle. And not need Horan to get in a cage match to spark it.\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands highlights: Alex Morgan almost scores game-winner\n\nThe goals were few and far between. The Dutch scored early and the Americans evened the game in the 62nd minute. It looked, briefly, like Alex Morgan scored a game-winner for the U.S., but the goal was called back for offside.\n\n(Still confused about what offside is? Let us explain.)\n\nUSWNT World Cup scenarios, Group E standings after draw vs Netherlands\n\nBecause of the USWNT’s awful first half against the Netherlands on Thursday, they have to win or draw with Portugal to ensure a spot in the knockout rounds. Lose, and the Americans could be going home after the group stage for the first time ever at the World Cup or Olympics.\n\nThere is a scenario where the Americans could lose and still advance if Vietnam beats the Netherlands and scores at least three goals. Given Vietnam has been outscored 5-0 in its first two games and was eliminated with its loss to Portugal, however, the chances of that are not good.\n\nWhich means the Americans need to win. Preferably by a large enough margin they maintain their advantage in goal differential – currently at plus-2 – over the Netherlands so they win the group and avoid the possibility of seeing England, Germany and France before the final.\n\nThe World Cup began in 1991, the Olympic tournament five years later, and not once has the USWNT failed to make it out of the group stage. In fact, with the exception of the 2016 Olympics, the U.S. women have gotten to the semifinals or better at every major tournament.\n\nWhy did Daniëlle van de Donk wear a swim cap at end of USA-Netherlands game?\n\nNetherlands player Daniëlle van de Donk went viral late in the 1-1 tie after a collision with USWNT midfielder Rose Lavelle left van de Donk with a gash on the side of her head.\n\nWhen the cut couldn’t stop bleeding, van de Donk reached for an interesting bandage: a swim camp. Videos and photos of her in the cap quickly circulated the internet and social media, leaving many to wonder what the heck was happening.\n\n“It just opened up and it's bleeding too much so I couldn't continue the game without it,” van de Donk said afterward.\n\n“Plus,\" she added with a laugh, \"it’s fashionable.\"\n\nWho was the USA vs. Netherlands referee?\n\nYoshimi Yamashita, a Japan official, was the referee during the USWNT’s 1-1 draw vs. Netherlands.\n\nThis is Yamashita’s second World Cup in as many years — last summer, she was one of six female referees to work the men’s World Cup in Qatar. The 37-year-old also regularly officiates games in Japan’s J League, the country’s top men’s league. Of course, she’s also one of the women’s games top officials. (This is her second women’s World Cup.)\n\nIn the U.S. vs. Netherlands’s game, Yamashita had to break up a heated argument and shoving match between U.S. midfielder Lindsey Horan and Netherlands’ midfielder Daniëlle van de Donk, after a hard tackle from van de Donk sent Horan to the ground in pain. Yamashita called the Lyon teammates together before she allowed the USWNT to take a corner kick.\n\n\"(Horan) came over, we just had a little talk,\" van de Donk said. \"The referee came in between us. It wasn’t very necessary. We just played football again after that.\"\n\nHoran had the last word, scoring on a header on the corner to tie the game.\n\nBut if anyone is thinking of putting Yamashita up for the Nobel Peace Prize, don't expect Horan to write the nomination.\n\n\"I don't know what (Yamashita) said,” the USWNT captain told reporters, rolling her eyes. “It was too long.\"\n\n2023 World Cup: USWNT stats\n\nLindsey Horan has arguably been the most reliable player for the USWNT through two World Cup games, scoring a goal against both Vietnam and Netherlands. Sophia Smith has tallied two goals also, though both of hers came against Vietnam in the Americans’ first win of group play.\n\nAdditionally, through two games Smith has notched one assist, as have Alex Morgan and super sub Rose Lavelle.\n\nAgainst Netherlands, the Dutch finished with just three shots on goal, which impressed USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski.\n\n\"That’s a good defense,\" Andonovski said. \"Anyone that can keep the Netherlands on three shots for 90 minutes is pretty good.\"\n\nUSWNT ties Netherlands 1-1 on header from Lindsey Horan\n\nA header from Lindsey Horan in the 62nd minute gave the UWSNT a goal it desperately needed, tying Netherlands 1-1.\n\nHoran had taken a hard foul from Danielle Van de Donk, and was still complaining to the referee about it when Rose Lavalle lined up to take a corner kick. Horan tracked it the whole way and outmuscled several Dutch defenders before burying it with a thunderous header.\n\nThe Americans had several other chances over the last 30 minutes, including a goal by Alex Morgan that was waved off for being offside. There was also a screamer by Trinity Rodman that went just wide and a shot by Sophia Smith that was cleared off the line.\n\nRose Lavelle subs in for USWNT, gets yellow card\n\nRose Lavelle, the 28-year-old midfielder who had a spectacular 2019 World Cup and scored the winning goal in the USWNT’s 2-0 win over Netherlands in the final, started the second half in place of Savannah DeMelo. The Americans trail 1-0 in the second game of group play.\n\nLavelle, who also came in as a sub vs. Vietnam, has been sidelined the last couple months with a knee injury. The Americans are hoping that like 2019, she provides a spark on the field.\n\nMinutes into the second half, Lavelle was issued a yellow card for a hard tackle on a Dutch player.\n\nWhat happens if US loses to Netherlands, are they out of World Cup?\n\nNo need to panic just yet. The US-Netherlands game is just the second of group play for the Americans. They’ve got Portugal next week. The top two teams from each group will advance to the knockout round — but the second place spot from Group E is a much tougher path to the World Cup final.\n\nIf Netherlands hangs on for a win tonight vs. the USWNT, that makes the game against Portugal a must win.\n\nUSWNT trailing Netherlands 1-0 at halftime\n\nThe USWNT couldn't equal Netherlands in the first half of play, trailing 1-0 as teams went to the locker room. The Americans look all out of sorts, and the stats aren't encouraging: The U.S. possessed the ball just 33% of the time, compared to 52% for the Dutch.\n\nThe Americans have just two shots on goal, while Netherlands is 1-for-1 in that category.\n\nExpect to see multiple U.S. subs in the second half.\n\nInstant analysis from Wellington: USWNT loses composure after early score\n\nThe USWNT was playing as well as it has in a long time early in the game. It was finding spaces, connecting passes and probing the Dutch defense, and it was working, with a couple of chances. But the Americans seemed to completely lose their composure after the Netherlands' goal. They looked tentative and disorganized, and they were out of sync when they did have chances.\n\nThat said, Sophia Smith was very active in the closing minutes of the half. The Dutch were manhandling her, but if she can shake them in the second half, a goal will come.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nCarli Lloyd questions USWNT's 'heart' vs. Netherlands\n\nCarli Lloyd did not hold back on the team she once played for. Nor did she forget from where she came from.\n\n\"I'm going to bring my Jersey bluntness,\" Lloyd said on the FOX halftime set in Sydney, Australia at the 2023 World Cup.\n\nAnalyzing the U.S. women's national team's first-half performance against the Netherlands, which left the Americans in a 1-0 deficit, Lloyd did that and then some: \"They look flat,\" said Lloyd, a member of the last two World Cup winning teams. \"I'm questioning their heart.\" — Chris Bumbaca\n\nJill Roord goal gives Netherlands early 1-0 lead on USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands took a 1-0 lead on the USWNT in the 17th minute after a whole lot of miscues by the Americans. A hard shot from Jill Roord found the corner of the net, just past Alyssa Naeher's hands. It was the Netherlands' first shot of the day.\n\nThe USWNT trails in a Women's World Cup match for the first time since the July 10, 2011 Quarterfinal match vs Brazil, according to ESPN.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nWellington, where the USWNT is taking on the Netherlands, is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWorld Cup standings\n\nIt can be hard to keep up with 2023 World Cup results given the time difference from the U.S., not to mention the different time zones across Australia and New Zealand. But we've got you covered, and you can check the standings right here.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup today\n\nWe've got the starting lineup for the USWNT's second group game of the 2023 World Cup, vs. the Netherlands, and it's the same as the other night vs. Vietnam.\n\nHere's the full lineup:\n\nGoalkeeper: Alyssa Naeher\n\nDefenders: Crystal Dunn, Naomi Girma, Julie Ertz, Emily Fox\n\nMidfielders: Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan, Savannah DeMelo\n\nForwards: Sophia Smith, Alex Morgan, Trinity Rodman\n\nUSWNT game tonight\n\nThe United States play their second Group stage game Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. They face Netherlands.\n\nUSA vs. Netherlands predictions\n\nNancy Armour, columnist: It will be another tight and physical game, as they always are when the USWNT and the Netherlands play. But the USWNT tends to respond when people claim they've lost their edge on the rest of the world, and I expect no different in this game. USWNT 3-0.\n\nLindsay Schnell, reporter: It’s time for Alex Morgan to join the scoring party, and you can expect the veteran forward to do just that. This game will be a mix of old and new, with both Morgan and Sophia Smith scoring — and I think both will come on assists from Trinity Rodman. USWNT 2-1.\n\nIs Alex Morgan playing tonight?\n\nYes, the forward is in the USWNT’s starting lineup, and looking to add to her 121-goal total. Morgan missed a penalty kick in the Americans' opener vs. Vietnam, but she's not stressed about it.\n\nUSWNT suits\n\nThe Americans wore their custom menswear-inspired “business” suits again for Game 2, arriving in style to Wellington Regional Stadium.\n\nWomen’s World Cup winners\n\nThe 2023 World Cup marks just the ninth time the event has taken place. (The men's World Cup, meanwhile, has been played since 1930.) The U.S. is seeking to become the first team, men’s or women’s, to win three consecutive titles. Germany, which won in 2003 and 2007, had a chance to do that in 2011 but couldn’t pull it off. The U.S. has won more women's World Cup titles than any other country. Here’s a list of every women’s World Cup winner.\n\n1991: United States\n\n1995: Norway\n\n1999: United States\n\n2003: Germany\n\n2007: Germany\n\n2011: Japan\n\n2015: United States\n\n2019: United States\n\nUSWNT missed opportunities vs. Vietnam: Why you shouldn’t be concerned\n\nWhen Sophia Smith has two goals and an assist in her first World Cup game, Lindsey Horan has a highlight reel’s worth of sick passes, and a roster full of newcomers get a much-needed dose of confidence, it’s hard to question the result.\n\nAnd yet, this is the United States women’s national team. Leave goals out on the field, as the USWNT did several times over in their 3-0 win against Vietnam on Saturday (Friday night in the U.S.), and those watching are going to be picky.\n\nThe good thing is, the USWNT isn’t satisfied, either.\n\nNetherlands starting lineup vs. USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands will be without two key pieces vs. the USWNT: Forwards Lineth Beerensteyn (ankle) and Vivianne Miedema (ACL) both started for the Dutch in the 2019 World Cup final, which the U.S. won 2-0. Many are looking at the 2023 meeting tonight as a rematch of sorts.\n\nBeerensteyn was injured in the Netherlands' opening game vs. Portugal, a 1-0 win for the Dutch. Miedema, 26, is one of the best players in the world. She tore her ACL in December.\n\nUSWNT jerseys and merch\n\nLooking for official the World Cup kits worn by Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and others?

The Southern California native was named a captain for this year's tournament where the team will attempt to make history with their third straight title. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow Alex Morgan grew from USWNT rising star to powerful advocate and disruptor\n\nMost of America knows Alex Morgan as the USWNT’s active leading goal scorer, No. 5 on the all-time list. Or as one of its most marketable stars: Attractive and wholesome-looking, appealing to both soccer diehards and those who don’t know the first thing about the sport.\n\nBut Morgan is also a disruptor. Keenly aware of the advantages her stardom has afforded her, she actively uses them to advocate for others.\n\n“She deserves a ton more credit than she gets in this regard,” said Becca Roux, executive director of the USWNT Players Association. “A lot of people talk,” Roux added. “She does a lot of work that people never see.”\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full feature here.\n\nHow Naomi Girma, Sophia Smith keep friend, late Stanford teammate Katie Meyer in hearts\n\nKatie Meyer’s parents joke that their daughter would have taken a plane, a ferry, even \"a trained dolphin\" to be in the stands at this World Cup, cheering on the Stanford teammates who were so close they were more like sisters than friends.\n\nGina and Steve Meyer are certain their daughter is still riding with the U.S. women, thanks to Sophia Smith, Naomi Girma and other players using the biggest moment of their careers to make sure Katie isn’t forgotten and no one else has to feel a similar loss.\n\n\"It is so heartwarming. And heartbreaking,\" Gina Meyer told USA TODAY Sports. \"We’re just so proud of them. They didn’t have to do anything but to remember their friend, but they really want to talk about this subject, which is usually brushed under the rug.\n\n\"It’s such a beautiful thing that this whole team jumped on board and said, 'We want to be a part of this.'\"\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full feature here.\n\nUSWNT: Why the Americans embrace the pressure of this World Cup\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the U.S. women are in sweats, training gear or those sharp-looking Nike x Martine Rose suits they're rocking at this World Cup.\n\nThey always wear a target on their backs. They're well aware of this. And they embrace it.\n\n“This is not team that does any sort of resting on its laurels,\" Megan Rapinoe said last month. \"That's what has been the fuel for this team always: To strive to be the very best.

Journal News\n\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — Ghouls, skeletons, witches and vampires have long figured at celebrations on Halloween. But this year a familiar and beloved fright figure — the Headless Horseman — is under new scrutiny because of sensitivities over terrorist attacks in the Middle East.\n\nThe change came in the wake of the beheading of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines by Islamic State militants. News of British aid worker Alan Henning's beheading was made public last week. The four Islamic State killings have prompted a national conversation over what constitutes appropriate Halloween decorations.\n\nMarketers of the Fox TV series Sleepy Hollow, which is loosely based on Washington Irving's 1820 short story, apologized after launching a \"National Headless Day\" ad campaign the same week terrorists released a video showing the beheading of Foley.\n\nAnd last month, The Associated Press reported Busch Gardens Williamsburg removed some props from a Halloween attraction called \"The Cut Throat Cove\" after people in Virginia complained about decapitated heads.\n\nBut here in the Lower Hudson Valley — Headless Horseman country, where Irving set his story, and home to The Blaze, one of the season's most popular tourist attractions — people take Halloween very, very seriously. And they're not planning to make any concessions.\n\n\"We have never censored the floats or costumes that participants bring to the parade; we don't plan on starting that practice now,\" said Scott Baird, president of the Nyack Chamber of Commerce, which organizes an annual Halloween parade attracting 25,000 to 30,000 people.\n\nFew places are as closely associated with the holiday as Sleepy Hollow, which changed its name from North Tarrytown in the 1990s.\n\nIrving's hellish horseman appears on street and store signs, police cars, municipal buildings and, most prominently, a steel statue of the headless horseman preparing to hurl his jack-o'-lantern not far from the Old Dutch Church.\n\nLocal merchants have embraced the holiday — and cashed in on the celebrations, which pump tens of thousands dollars into the local economy, according to Anthony Giaccio, the village administrator.\n\nSitting outside the Horseman Restaurant recently, Christian Keesey, 39, of Ossining, said the village should stick to tradition.\n\n\"Are people going to stop dressing up as zombies because of Ebola?\" he said. \"Of course they're not.\"\n\nSome Halloween event organizers said they already shy from the fake blood, guts and gore. They embrace more traditional scares like late-night ghost tours and haunted hayrides.\n\n\"It's not really an issue for us,\" said Howard Zar, executive director of Lyndhurst, home to Jay Ghoul's House of Curiosities. \"We don't have anything bloody. It's about the art and the decoration.\"\n\nOthers are adamantly against any changes, especially in reaction to terrorist activities.\n\nRob Schweitzer, director of public relations for Historic Hudson Valley, six historic sites that includes Philipsburg Manor, said it had no plans to alter its popular Horseman's Hollow event.\n\nThe fright-night attraction features costumed characters — some decapitated — elaborate sets, special effects and a \"twisted maze of horrors too terrible to describe,\" according to its website.\n\n\"That historic, iconic character has absolutely no connection to anything occurring in the Middle East,\" Schweitzer said in an e-mail.\n\n\"Our collective popular culture has a long history of flirting with violence, murder, mayhem and gore,\" he added. \"Playing a little bit of psychologist, I would say some people like haunted attractions because they are 'safe scares' that take them away from worrying about the really scary things in their own lives and the world at large.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/football/usmnt-wales-timothy-weah-gareth-bale-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Gareth Bale saves Wales to frustrate USMNT | CNN", "text": "Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan, Qatar CNN —\n\nThere was frustration for the United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) in its opening game of Qatar 2022 as Gareth Bale scored a late penalty for Wales.\n\nThe USMNT was dominant for much of the match, but as has so often been the case, it was LAFC star Bale who dug Wales out of a sticky situation as this Group B game ended 1-1.\n\nThe 22-year-old Timothy Weah, son of soccer great George Weah, had put the US ahead in the first-half with a fine finish but this young US side – with an average age of 25 years and 175 days – was unable to maintain its dominance and allowed Wales to snatch a draw.\n\nThere was no shortage of American fans inside the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on Monday and they made their voices heard, exchanging songs with the Welsh contingent behind the opposite goal.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

Canadian writer Esi Edugyan, who chaired the judging panel, said the book is \"a triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave\" in which Lynch \"pulls off feats of language that are stunning to witness.\"\n\nLynch, 46, had been the bookies' favorite to win the prestigious prize, which usually brings a big boost in sales. His book beat five other finalists from Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and Canada, chosen from 163 novels submitted by publishers.\n\n\"This was not an easy book to write,\" Lynch said after being handed the Booker trophy. \"The rational part of me believed I was dooming my career by writing this novel, though I had to write the book anyway. We do not have a choice in such matters.\"\n\nLynch has called \"Prophet Song,\" his fifth novel, an attempt at \"radical empathy\" that tries to plunge readers into the experience of living in a collapsing society.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n\"I was trying to see into the modern chaos,\" he told the Booker website. \"The unrest in Western democracies. The problem of Syria — the implosion of an entire nation, the scale of its refugee crisis and the West's indifference. … I wanted to deepen the reader's immersion to such a degree that by the end of the book, they would not just know, but feel this problem for themselves.\"\n\nThe five prize judges met to pick the winner on Saturday, less than 48 hours after far-right violence erupted in Dublin following a stabbing attack on a group of children.\n\nEdugyan said that immediate events didn't directly influence the choice of winner. She said that Lynch's book \"captures the social and political anxieties of our current moment\" but also deals with \"timeless\" themes.\n\nThe other finalists were Irish writer Paul Murray's \"The Bee Sting;\" American novelist Paul Harding's \"This Other Eden;\" Canadian author Sarah Bernstein's \"Study for Obedience;\" U.S. writer Jonathan Escoffery's \"If I Survive You;\" and British author Chetna Maroo's \"Western Lane.\"\n\nEdugyan said the choice of winner wasn't unanimous, but the six-hour judges' meeting wasn't acrimonious.\n\n\"We all ultimately felt that this was the book that we wanted to present to the world and that this was truly a masterful work of fiction,\" she said.\n\nFounded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to English-language novels from any country published in the U.K. and Ireland. and has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel.\n\nFour Irish novelists and one from Northern Ireland have previously won the prize. \"It is with immense pleasure that I bring the Booker home to Ireland,\" Lynch said.\n\nLynch received his trophy from last year's winner, Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka, during a ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London.\n\nThe evening included a speech from Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman who was jailed in Tehran for almost six years until 2022 on allegations of plotting the overthrow of Iran's government — a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups denied.\n\nShe talked about the books that sustained her in prison, recalling how inmates ran an underground library and circulated copies of Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" set in an oppressive American theocracy.\n\n\"Books helped me to take refuge into the world of others when I was incapable of making one of my own,\" Zaghari-Ratcliffe said. \"They salvaged me by being one of the very few tools I had, together with imagination, to escape the Evin (prison) walls without physically moving.\"\n\nHow 'Fahrenheit 451' inspiresBookPeople of Moscow store to protect books and ideas\n\nA.S.

The final field included six novels.\n\nThe award is open to any author, writing originally in English and whose book is published in the United Kingdom, irrespective of nationality. The six-book shortlist has been whittled down from 155 novels by five judges who are reported to read a book a day for six months. The victor usually sees a huge boost in sales and profile. This year, three Britons, two Americans and a Canadian are vying for the prize.\n\nBeatty will receive the prize from Prince Charles’ wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during a ceremony at London’s medieval Guildhall. Previous winners include Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Hilary Mantel. In 2015, the winner was Marlon James for A Brief History of Seven Killings, a book that revolves around an attempt to assassinate musician Bob Marley in 1976.

And see how your experience has changed. Is it better? Is it worse?”\n\nMusk repeatedly urged skeptics to use the platform while addressing questions about his proposal to offer blue check marks to users who agree to pay $8 a month — a plan whose rollout has been marred by uncertainty and abrupt changes.\n\nUsers who pay for Twitter Blue, the platform’s subscription service, will not be required to provide identifying information other than a credit card and a phone number, Musk confirmed. Twitter will eventually default to displaying tweets from Twitter Blue subscribers, while tweets from users who do not pay for a blue check mark, he said, would be relegated to a separate page on the site and effectively buried unless viewers sought out that material.\n\nBrands will be expected to foot the bill for their own verification on Twitter Blue, Musk said. He did not go into specifics about a separate, gray verification badge Twitter is developing for major brands, government accounts and media outlets — a feature the company has said will not be available for purchase but rather bestowed on high-profile accounts to distinguish them from those who paid for blue check marks. On Wednesday Twitter briefly appeared to have rolled out the grey check mark feature for some users, though Musk soon after tweeted that he had “killed it.” A Twitter product manager working on the feature left the door open for its eventual release.\n\nMusk also argued, contrary to some of his critics, that well-resourced purveyors of mis- and disinformation would not be able to game the system because they would quickly run out of phone numbers and credit cards, or eventually tire of the effort.\n\nMusk sought to distill many of the challenges of running a social media platform into a binary.\n\n“Thinking of it as an information problem, truth is signal and falsehood is noise,” he said. “And we want to improve the signal-to-noise ratio as much as possible.”\n\nMusk’s expansive plans for Twitter include adding financial products to the mix. It could begin, he said, with Twitter allowing users to pay each other through the platform, with the company setting up each user with an initial gift of $10 to test it out. Over time, Musk added, Twitter will offer the ability for users to transfer money out of its system to third-party banks — and then to market its own banking services.\n\n“The next step would be a money market account so you can get an extremely high yield on your balance,” Musk said, adding that debit cards and checks could also be a part of the plan.\n\nLast week, Twitter submitted registration paperwork to the US government that indicated its intent to join the payments industry, and to comply with certain banking regulations. A copy of the paperwork viewed by CNN showed that the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network received the registration filing by “Twitter Payments LLC” on Nov. 4. A FinCEN spokesperson declined to comment on Twitter’s filing, which had been first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nMusk acknowledged brands’ concerns about the presence of hate speech and other offensive content on the platform.\n\n“I don’t think having hate speech next to an ad is great, obviously,” he said with a chuckle.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s head of integrity and safety, said Twitter is increasing its investment in ideas to battle hateful content.\n\n“We think there’s a lot of other stuff we can do, from warning messages to interstitials, to reducing the reach of that content, that we haven’t fully explored in the past,” Roth said, vowing to implement those ideas quickly. Twitter has implemented many of these steps in the past, particularly in response to election and Covid-19 misinformation.\n\nMusk said he and his teams are at work changing much of Twitter’s existing codebase, partly to support new features such as longform video. That feature, he said, will initially allow paid users to download 10 minutes of high-definition video before gradually lengthening that time limit to 40 minutes and then several hours.\n\nAnd he emphasized the importance of Community Notes, formerly known as Birdwatch, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature that Twitter has been testing with some of its users.\n\nCommunity Notes, he said, “will obviate the need for a lot of the content stuff that’s currently in place, I think.”\n\nThe sprawling question-and-answer session occasionally delved into the metaphorical and philosophical.\n\nAt one point, Musk appeared to acknowledge that his commitment to “free speech” was not absolute.\n\n“There’s a giant difference between freedom of speech and freedom of reach,” he said.\n\nMusk also described Twitter’s existing verification system as a “lords and peasants situation” and compared it to the American Revolutionary War.\n\n“In the United States, we fought a war to get rid of that stuff,” he said. “Maybe this is a dumb decision, but we’ll see.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/tech/yoel-roth-twitter-elon-musk/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk: Twitter is less safe due to new owner's management ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk’s dictatorial management style risks driving the company headlong into unforced business blunders, content moderation disasters and the degradation of core platform features that help keep vulnerable users safe, according to a former top Twitter official who led the company’s content moderation before abruptly resigning this month.\n\nThe social media company’s botched rollout of a paid verification feature “is an example of a disaster that slipped through” amid the chaos Musk brought to Twitter, and the prospect of further disasters made it impossible to stay, said Yoel Roth, the company’s former head of site integrity, during an onstage interview with the journalist Kara Swisher Tuesday in his first public appearance since quitting Twitter on Nov. 10.\n\nRoth and other colleagues tried to warn Musk of the “obvious” problems in his plan to offer a verified check mark to any user who paid $8 a month. But Musk charged ahead anyway through sheer force of will, leading to a wave of new impostor accounts posing as major brands, athletes and other verified users that soon forced Twitter to suspend the feature.\n\n“It went off the rails in exactly the ways that we anticipated,” Roth said, speaking at a conference hosted by the Knight Foundation, a journalism nonprofit.\n\nThe public reflections of a senior Twitter leader who had close contact with Musk in the raw, early days of his ownership of the company — a period marked by internal tumult and a damaging advertiser revolt — provide the latest evidence of a billionaire CEO who leads by his gut at the expense of virtually everyone else.\n\nThere was no explosive confrontation with Musk that led to Roth’s resignation, and the episode involving Twitter’s paid verification feature was only one of many factors that drove Roth’s decision to leave, he said. But the experience exemplified the kind of damage Musk’s freewheeling approach can do, Roth added, likening his final weeks at the company to standing before a leaky dam, trying desperately to plug the holes but knowing that eventually something would get past him.\n\nIn the hour-long interview, Roth warned Musk’s laissez-faire approach to content moderation, and his lack of a transparent process for making and enforcing platform policies, has made Twitter less safe, in part because there aren’t enough staff remaining who understand that malicious actors are constantly trying to game the system in ways that automated algorithms don’t know how to catch.\n\n“People are not sitting still,” he said. “They are actively devising new ways to be horrible on the internet.”\n\nHe urged Twitter users to monitor the functioning of key safety features such as muting, blocking and protected tweets as early warning signs the platform may be breaking down.\n\n“If protected tweets stop working, run,” he said.\n\nFor two weeks after Musk closed his purchase of Twitter, Roth presented himself as a voice of stability and calm at the center of a company undergoing dramatic change. Roth knew that by remaining at the company, Musk was using him to help keep advertisers from abandoning the platform. But Roth also suggested that he and others who did not leave Twitter may have been able to influence Musk and keep him from making damaging unilateral decisions, which he had “multiple opportunities” to do.\n\nEven as he spent his initial days in the new regime battling a “surge in hateful conduct on Twitter” apparently meant to test Musk’s tolerance for racism and antisemitism on the platform, Roth sought to reassure the public that Twitter’s trust and safety work continued unhindered.\n\nHe shared data on the platform’s ongoing enforcement efforts, and downplayed the impact of Twitter’s mass layoffs on its content moderation team, saying the job cuts were less severe in that department compared to the wider organization.\n\nAs late as Nov. 9, Roth spoke alongside Musk during a public Twitter Spaces event intended to persuade advertisers not to flee the platform. In the hour-long session, which was attended by more than 100,000 listeners, including representatives of Adidas, Chevron and other major brands, Roth waxed optimistic about Twitter’s plans to fight hate speech.\n\nThe very next day, Roth abruptly resigned, joining a slew of other senior executives including Twitter’s chief privacy officer and chief information security officer.\n\nIn a subsequent New York Times op-ed, Roth said his reason for leaving came down to Musk’s highly personal and improvisational approach to content moderation. Roth’s essay accused Musk of perpetuating a “lack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-length pronouncements about Twitter’s rules.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Roth said the popular narrative that describes Musk as a villain is wrong and doesn’t reflect his own experiences with him. But, he said, Musk surrounds himself with those who rarely challenge him.\n\nBefore Musk took over Twitter, Roth wrote down several commitments to himself that would trigger the decision to quit. One limit, he said — one that was never reached — was that Roth would refuse to lie for Musk. Another limit, one that was ultimately reached and drove his decision to resign, was “if Twitter starts being ruled by dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.”\n\nRoth’s role at Twitter came under intense scrutiny in 2020 after the company appended a fact-check message to false tweets by then-US President Donald Trump.\n\nTweets that Roth sent in 2016 and 2017 that were critical of President Trump and his supporters were dug up and used to argue that Roth and Twitter were biased against the president.\n\nAmong Roth’s tweets was one he wrote on Election Day 2016 that read, “I’m just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.”\n\nTwitter defended Roth at the time, saying, “No one person at Twitter is responsible for our policies or enforcement actions, and it’s unfortunate to see individual employees targeted for company decisions.”\n\nWhen Roth was still working at Twitter in October, Musk was asked about Roth’s old tweets.\n\n“We’ve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs,” Musk tweeted.\n\nRoth also became the personal face of Twitter, and a target of harassment, after the company decided to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden, a decision then-CEO Jack Dorsey has since said was a mistake.\n\n“It’s widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden story. That is not true. It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue,” Roth told Swisher on Tuesday.\n\nRoth did not feel removing the content from Twitter was appropriate, he said, but at the time the story seemed to bear the hallmarks of a hack-and-leak information operation. Roth also said Tuesday that, in retrospect, suppressing the Hunter Biden story was a mistake.\n\n“They were on alert from what happened in 2016 and all the hacked emails and things,” Swisher told CNN Wednesday morning, reflecting on her discussion with Roth.\n\nWhile Roth may have disagreed with suppressing the Hunter Biden story, he defended Twitter’s other decisions to ban Trump for his activities around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, as well as a personal account belonging to Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and an account belonging to the satirical website Babylon Bee.\n\nAll three cases involved obvious violations of Twitter’s publicly accessible, written policies, Roth said, making them a much clearer case for enforcement.\n\nAmid the layoffs that have decimated Twitter’s content moderation team, Musk has said he intends to rely much more heavily on crowdsourced fact-checking of tweets to provide context to misleading claims. But Roth said that in doing so, Twitter risks abdicating its responsibility to the public, which should still apply despite it being a private company.\n\nPolicymakers should require platforms to share data with academics and researchers, he said, preempting privately owned platforms such as Twitter from shirking a duty to transparency.\n\nAsked to give a single piece of advice to Musk going forward, Roth paused for the briefest of moments.\n\n“Humility goes a really long way,” he said.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n- CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/tech/twitter-advertisers/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk said Twitter has seen a 'massive drop in revenue' as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk said Friday that Twitter has seen a “massive drop in revenue,” as a growing number of advertisers pause spending on the platform in the wake of his $44 billion acquisition.\n\n“Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he said in a tweet. “Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”\n\nThe remarks come as brands, including General Mills and the Volkswagen Group, pause advertising on the social network and as civil society organizations called on Twitter’s advertisers to halt all spending globally, citing uncertainty about the direction of the company under Musk.\n\n“We have paused advertising on Twitter,” Kelsey Roemhildt, a spokesperson for General Mills, told CNN in a statement, making it the first company that doesn’t compete with Musk’s Tesla to confirm such a move. “As always, we will continue to monitor this new direction and evaluate our marketing spend,” the spokesperson said.\n\nIn a separate statement, Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche and Bentley, confirmed it had recommended its brands “pause their paid activities on the platform until further notice.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the moves, also said Pfizer and Mondalez are pausing ads on Twitter. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe companies join General Motors, which had previously said it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates the platform’s “new direction.” Toyota, another Tesla competitor, previously told CNN that it is “in discussions with key stakeholders and monitoring the situation” on Twitter.\n\nOn Friday, organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, upped their pressure campaign for more brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to Friday’s mass layoffs of Twitter staff as a key factor in their thinking, citing fears that Musk’s cuts will make Twitter’s election integrity policies effectively unenforceable, even if they technically remain active.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about Musk’s pending acquisition, advertisers are now confronting questions around how Musk will change the platform, which is already an also-ran in the digital ad space despite its outsized political influence. Musk, known as both an innovative entrepreneur and an erratic figure, has promised to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies and undo permanent bans of controversial figures, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat creates a challenge for brands, which are sensitive to the types of content their ads run against, an issue made more complicated by social media. Most marketers bristle at the thought of having their ads run alongside toxic content such as hate speech, pornography or misinformation.\n\nAd buying giant Interpublic Group, which works with consumer brands such as Unilever and Coca Cola, earlier this week also recommended its clients pause advertising on the platform.\n\nMusk has said he’s not a fan of advertising and is currently working to boost Twitter’s subscription revenue to boost its bottom line and be less dependent on ad sales, which account for 90% of Twitter’s overall revenue. But this shift won’t happen overnight, if it happens at all. Musk said he plans to launch an $8 per month subscription plan that will provide users with a verification mark, as well as several other perks, but the plans has faced sharp backlash.\n\nIn the meantime, Musk is working to stave off a possible advertiser exodus. Musk’s team spent Monday “meeting with the marketing and advertising community” in New York, according to Jason Calacanis, a member of Musk’s inner circle.\n\nMusk also met earlier this week with a group of leaders of civil society organizations, including the ADL, Free Press and the NAACP, to address concerns about a rise in hate on the platform. Representatives who attended the meeting told CNN they were encouraged by Musk’s willingness to talk and his initial commitments not to change the company’s content policies ahead of the midterms, but called on him to take further steps to protect the platform.\n\nSince meeting with Musk, representatives of some of the same organizations said, Twitter’s new owner has demonstrated “erratic” behavior that has “betrayed” the commitments he made privately to the groups.\n\nShortly before news broke last week that his $44 billion Twitter acquisition was completed, Musk wrote an open letter attempting to reassure advertisers that he does not want the social network to become a “free-for-all hellscape.”\n\n“Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,” he wrote. “Let us build something extraordinary together.”\n\n– CNN’s Brian Fung, Peter Valdes-Dapena and Jon Passantino contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Catherine Thorbecke", "Clare Duffy", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/10/28/elon-musk-twitter-deal-closes-what-we-know/10617417002/", "title": "'Freed' bird: Day 1 of Elon Musk's Twitter and the social media ...", "text": "For most market watchers or even casual observers of headlines over the last several years, the last 24 hours have been big: Elon Musk, the celebrated space entrepreneur, prolific and provocative Tweeter and the world's richest man, has finally closed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter.\n\nElon Musk – who is also Tesla's CEO – confirmed the deal in less than 280 characters.

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), meanwhile, gained 18,679 new followers during the same period.

The post was then shared on several extremist Telegram channels, according to the ADL.\n\n“This strategic spread of hateful content on @Twitter warrants concern for how extremists view potential changes to Twitter's content rules,” the organization tweeted. “The campaign also follows weeks of #antisemitic discourse being spread by public figures.”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nMusk's many jobs: How many companies does he run now?\n\nWith the takeover of Twitter, Musk now runs five companies in multiple industries: electric vehicle maker Tesla, rocket and satellite company SpaceX, tunneling company The Boring Company and neuroscience startup Neuralink.\n\nInvestors worry that the competing demands on his time are stretching Musk too thin, particularly at a time when Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX all face challenges.\n\n'Burnt Hair':Elon Musk sells millions worth of new perfume within hours of its release\n\nLove for money:Elon Musk's ex-girlfriend auctioning off signed love note, emerald necklace for thousands\n\nTesla has acknowledged in regulatory filings that its dependence on Musk is a risk factor.\n\n“Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla,” the company said.\n\nBut Musk’s energizer-bunny pace has not appeared to put a damper on Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, and SpaceX, one of the U.S.’s most valuable startups.\n\nMusk acknowledges that the intense workload gets to him.\n\n“It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands, as opposed to just working day and night from when I wake up till when I go to sleep seven days a week.

How to shut down the hate, harassment\n\nHow to delete Twitter account? Step-by-step guide to permanently remove your account.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nHow to delete Twitter data\n\nTwitter handles some 500 million to 700 million tweets a day, which adds up to roughly 12 terabytes of data every 24 hours.\n\nThat's a huge risk if that data falls into the wrong hands, Arthur Herman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, recently wrote in Forbes – and Twitter had big data breaches before all of that information became Musk's.\n\nIn July, a breach exposed the email address and phone number of 5.4 million Twitter profiles. At that time, Twitter recommended anyone trying to stay anonymous should not link a publicly known phone number or email to their Twitter account.\n\nThen in August, whistleblower Peiter Zatko exposed what he said was lax security at Twitter, which could make the company’s data vulnerable to foreign infiltration as well as improper use and storage of user data.\n\nNow all that data – including your direct messages because they are not end-to-end encrypted – belongs to Elon Musk.\n\nThe data Twitter collects and saves includes your tweets, likes, direct messages, ad clicks, followers and those you’re following. If you’ve granted access, it can also collect information from your phone’s contact list.\n\nIf you’re concerned about your data privacy or considering leaving Twitter, here are a few things you can do:\n\nTo delete your account go to Settings → Your Account → Deactivate Your Account. This will not delete your data immediately because Twitter holds onto your data for at least 30 days in case you change your mind.\n\nBefore deleting, you may want to try a few other solutions:\n\nBack up your tweets by going to Settings → Your Account → Download an Archive of Your Data.\n\nYou can delete all your old tweets, but not through Twitter itself. Use a third-party app like Tweetdelete.net. It can also delete all your old likes. Twitter says deleted tweets are not publicly available but it’s unclear how long they’re saved on the company’s servers.\n\nIf you’ve used Twitter DMs for private conversations you want to remove, you can delete an individual message from your account, but it will still exist for the other people in the conversation.\n\nLock down your account completely so only your followers can see them:\n\nDo this by going to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Audience and Tagging, then select Protect Your Tweets. Or you can stay public but protect your account from harassment by muting and blocking certain types of profiles.\n\nGo to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Mute and Block → Muted Notifications and you can choose to mute, for example, new accounts which could be spam or bots.\n\n– Katie Wedell\n\nTrump says Twitter now in 'sane hands'\n\nFormer president Donald Trump also weighed in on the Twitter deal Friday, saying in a post on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that he considers Musk's takeover to have placed the platform in \"sane hands.\"\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nMusk will be 'digging in' on shadow bans as hate speech, slurs appear\n\nReports began surfacing early Friday that hate speech and racial epithets are flying on Twitter. Holocaust deniers were also reported on the platform.\n\nTwitter users were quick to note Friday that they were beginning to see changes in the way the platform worked and how it was removing bans on users previously limited on the site, sometimes as a direct result of tweeting Musk.\n\nIn answer to that, Musk tweeted Friday that he'll be \"digging in\" more today on lifting shadow bans and rolling back restrictions on users.\n\nFar-right commentators, including well-known YouTuber Tim Pool, also weighed in about changes.\n\nUsers who had either had their content moderated or knew people who had encountered Twitter bans or shadow bans also tweeted Musk directly asking to have those lifted and listed the names of people they felt should be brought back to the platform.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nWhen did Elon close his deal for Twitter?\n\nMultiple news outlets reported late Thursday that, after months of legal wrangling and public acrimony, Musk had closed the deal and fired top executives including the company's CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\nTwitter chairman Bret Taylor removed that title from his Twitter bio.\n\nA deal is done? Elon Musk takes control of Twitter, sources say\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nMusk may need to pay as much as $200 million to fired executives\n\nAgrawal; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; and Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive, all had strict contractual agreements in place for what might happen in the event of a takeover.\n\nMarketWatch reports that the three own about $65 million worth of Twitter stock and get another $119.6 million in stock if they are terminated.\n\n\"In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million.

Musk told workers at Twitter's headquarters on Wednesday \"that he doesn't plan to cut 75 percent of the staff when he takes over the company, according to people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg wrote.\n\nTwitter employees fret ahead of deal deadline:Musk reportedly wants 75% cut to Twitter workforce\n\n-- Jessica Guynn\n\nWhat did Elon Musk buy Twitter for?\n\nMusk wound up paying his original bid price: $54.20 a share, or roughly $44 billion.\n\nAt the time of his April offer, the amount represented a 33% premium to Twitter's stock price. But the company has since been caught up in a wider drop in tech stock prices, record-high inflation squeezing investors and increasing fears of a recession.\n\nMusk has been vocal about overpaying about the purchase, although Twitter had closed at $53.70 on Thursday, a marked upswing from its lowest point of $32.65 in July.\n\n\"Although obviously myself and other investors are overpaying for Twitter right now,\" Musk recently said, \"the long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude higher than its current value.\"\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nMore:Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming'\n\nWhy does Elon Musk want Twitter?\n\nThe deal gives the Tesla billionaire control of one of the world’s most powerful megaphones.\n\nIt also gives Musk access to the data of nearly 400 million users and the ability to bring back people and organizations previously banned or sidelined by Twitter, including former President Donald Trump\n\nWho will run Twitter now?\n\nFor now, it appears Musk is helming Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday he changed his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\" shortly before walking into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters carrying a porcelain sink, resurrecting a meme that has been internet lore for years. \"Let that sink in,\" he tweeted.\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nTwitter deal: Why 'Chief Twit' Elon Musk brought along a sink on his visit to Twitter headquarters\n\nIs Donald Trump coming back to Twitter?\n\nNow that Elon Musk is running Twitter, the Tesla billionaire is likely to reverse a permanent ban against Trump for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nMusk has indicated he would allow Trump back on the social media platform where the former president had more than 88 million followers.\n\n“Would be great to unwind permanent bans, except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence,” Musk texted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in April, according to court filings.\n\nAt a conference in May, Musk said: “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake.”\n\n– Jessica Guynn\n\nWill Trump return? Is Donald Trump coming back to Twitter now that Elon Musk bought the company?\n\nWill Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter mean more hate, extremism online?\n\nWhen Elon Musk first agreed to buy Twitter in April, he said the social media site has the potential to become “the platform for free speech around the globe” and he would unlock it.\n\nMusk, who closed the $44 billion deal after a months-long legal fight, has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and expressed concern over the way Twitter moderates its users.\n\nNow that Musk owns Twitter, will he make good on his promise to loosen content moderation rules in the name of “free speech?”\n\nMusk said Thursday he doesn’t want the site to become “a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences” in a message to advertisers, who analysts have said may be scared off by the Tesla CEO’s stance on free speech.\n\nExtremists cheer Musk Twitter deal: Oath Keepers trial heats up & more LGBTQ harassment\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” Musk said in a note posted on Twitter.\n\nCritics have expressed concern that Musk would allow harmful or extremist speech on the site and experts have warned that loosening content moderation could cause real-world harm.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, have celebrated Musk's Twitter takeover, as many accuse social media platforms of routinely censoring their voices, feelings further fueled earlier this year after former President Donald Trump was permanently banned from Twitter.\n\nMusk has indicated he would let Trump, who was banned for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, back on the site.\n\n– Amanda Pérez Pintado\n\nThings getting nasty on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? How to shut down the hate, harassment\n\nHow will advertisers respond to a Twitter with less moderation?\n\nElon Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has been advocating for less content moderation on Twitter since his plans to take over the company were first announced in April.\n\n\"We want to have the perception and the reality that speech is as free as possible,\" Musk said in April at the TED2022 conference. \"Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”\n\nThe idea seems to harken back to the early days of Twitter; former CEO Dick Costolo called the site the “free-speech wing of the free-speech party” in the early 2010s.\n\nSince then, Twitter has adopted stricter policies to combat disinformation, misinformation and hate speech. The platform’s rules prohibit targeted harassment, COVID-19 misinformation and election manipulation.\n\nA different Twitter Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming'\n\nMusk’s talk about softening some of Twitter’s rules to any speech has raised red flags for advertisers.\n\nShortly after the Wall Street Journal released a report about Madison Avenue’s concerns, Musk issued a statement on Twitter saying the social media platform \"obviously cannot become a free-for-all-hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nMusk’s tweet was addressed to advertisers, the company’s primary source of revenue.\n\n“Social networks are trying to do a better job removing hateful content, content that is antisemitic, content that’s blatantly misinformation,” said Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University. “That’s something that advertisers worry about.”\n\n– Bailey Schulz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/09/20/elon-musk-charge-x-twitter-users-monthly-fee/70905407007/", "title": "Making me pay for X will kill Twitter, just as Elon intended", "text": "So Twitter-slayer Elon Musk is thinking about making all users pay to access the site now known, dumbly, as X.\n\nHe said Monday he’s considering “a small monthly payment,” a move that will put on-the-bubble X users like myself in a bit of a quandary.\n\nDo I pay money to the world’s most annoying billionaire so I can still access a social media site increasingly populated by right-wing trolls, antisemites and middle-school-quality bullies? Or should I take that money and simply pay someone to repeatedly hit me in the face with a cast iron skillet?\n\nDo I shell out a recurring payment for a platform that, since Musk took over, has become increasingly useless and hate-filled, or do I use that money to buy deli meat I can rub on my body before jumping into the polar bear exhibit at a nearby zoo?\n\nElon Musk suggests we pay him money to suffer abuse on what's left of Twitter\n\nIt’s a tough call.

Musk acts vengeful toward liberals, routinely decrying the “woke mind virus,” whatever that is, and he gives off the vibe of someone rich enough to burn money just to make the lives of those he doesn’t like a bit worse.\n\nAnd hey, if being a villain to the left is his bag, if siding with objectively terrible people is what he wants to do, have at it, space man.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/tech/elon-musk-amnesty-poll/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk says he will broadly restore Twitter accounts which were ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk said Thursday that he will begin restoring most previously banned accounts on Twitter starting next week, in his most wide-reaching move yet to undo the social media platform’s policy of permanently suspending users who repeatedly violated its rules.\n\n“The people have spoken,” Musk tweeted on Thursday. “Amnesty begins next week. Vox Populi, Vox Dei.”\n\nThe announcement comes after Musk on Wednesday polled his followers about whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.”\n\nThe poll, which closed around 12:45 pm ET on Thursday, finished with 72.4% voting in favor of the proposition and 27.6% voting against. The poll garnered more than 3 million votes on Twitter.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how Musk and his team at Twitter will sort out which accounts had been banned for illegal or spam content versus other violations, nor how many total accounts will be restored.\n\nMusk announced last week that he would restore the account of Donald Trump after another poll he posted on the platform ended slightly in favor of returning the former President, who had been banned following the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, to the platform. Musk has also restored the accounts of several other controversial, previously banned or suspended users, including conservative Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee, comedian Kathy Griffin and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nShortly after acquiring Twitter, Musk said he would create a “content moderation council” with “widely diverse viewpoints,” and that no major content decisions would be made until it was in place. There is no evidence that such a group has been formed or was involved in Musk’s replatforming decisions. Instead, after Musk restored Trump’s account, he tweeted “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of god.”\n\nPrior to Musk’s takeover, Twitter typically imposed “strikes” that corresponded with suspensions for escalating periods of time when users repeatedly broke its rules against Covid-19 or civic integrity misinformation, giving users up to nine chances before they were booted from the platform. The platform also had other enforcement mechanisms — such as labeling a tweet or reducing its reach — for its additional rules including those prohibiting terrorism, threats of violence against individuals or groups of people, targeted abuse or harassment, publishing another person’s private information, and content promoting abuse or self-harm.\n\nMusk has previously said he disagreed with Twitter’s policy of permanent bans.\n\n“New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, not freedom of reach,” Musk said in a tweet last week, echoing an approach that is something of an industry standard. “Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.”\n\nThe decision to restore countless previously banned accounts could further alienate Twitter’s advertisers, many of whom have fled the platform in the wake of the chaos since Musk took over and out of fear that their ads could end up running alongside objectionable content. Musk has said the departure of key Twitter advertisers in recent weeks has led to a “massive drop in revenue” for the company.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Catherine Thorbecke", "Clare Duffy", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/tech/twitter-employees-ultimatum-deadline/index.html", "title": "After Elon Musk's 'extremely hardcore' work ultimatum Twitter ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAnother employee exodus appears to be underway at Twitter as many workers rejected Elon Musk’s terms for staying with the company, choosing instead to depart, according to multiple current and former employees.\n\nAs the deadline approached for Twitter employees to respond to Elon Musk’s ultimatum to commit to working in an “extremely hardcore” fashion at the company or leave, some employees appeared to publicly indicate they had chosen the latter option. On Thursday afternoon, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji, which has become a signal that someone is exiting the company. One Twitter employee said in a tweet that deciding to join the company was “one of the easiest decisions ever made. Deciding to leave today was 100% the opposite.”\n\nMeanwhile, an internal Slack channel at the company was filled with employees posting the salute emoji after the 5pm ET deadline, indicating they had chosen not to sign Musk’s pledge and depart the company, employees told CNN.\n\nTwitter’s remaining workforce had until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday to decide whether they wanted to be a part of the culture Musk wants to implement at the social media company, or else effectively resign, according to an email he sent to staff Wednesday.\n\nA former Twitter executive who recently exited the company described Thursday’s employee exits as a “mass exodus.”\n\nOn Thursday evening following the exits, employees remaining at the company received an email alerting them that the company’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN from a current Twitter employee. Musk’s team similarly shuttered offices during the mass layoffs earlier this month out of a concern for safety and an apparent fear that exiting employees could attempt to sabotage the company on their way out.\n\nTwo Twitter employees told CNN ahead of the deadline on Thursday that they planned to reject the ultimatum, citing a toxic work environment they say the billionaire has introduced. Another Twitter employee told CNN Wednesday they were still weighing the decision, saying the email from Musk “felt like a punch in the gut because no matter how you felt about wanting to stay or wanting to go, you were forced to make a decision and feel like you’re up against the time clock to make the best decision for you and your family.”\n\nThe employee added: “Those decisions are more than just 24 hours.”\n\nMusk told employees on Wednesday that his goal is to build “Twitter 2.0” and that employees who choose to stay will be required to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and presumably agreeing to Musk’s demand for Twitter employees, who have been largely working remotely, to return to in-office work. As of midday Thursday, employees still did not have clarity on which remote-work exceptions would be granted if they decide to stay, one employee said.\n\nLater on Thursday, amid an apparent scramble by management to avoid losing too many workers to the ultimatum, Musk sent an email to staff attempting to clarify his position on remote work, according to text of the email obtained by CNN from a Twitter employee who asked not to be identified.\n\n“Regarding remote work, all that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” Musk said in the email, adding that workers would be expected to attend in-person meetings no less than once a month.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Musk sent a follow up email saying: “At risk of stating the obvious, any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.”\n\nThe decision to issue an ultimatum came after Musk earlier this month fired half of Twitter’s staff, reducing its workforce to around 3,700 employees, and also reportedly cut many of Twitter’s contract workers. He also pushed out its top leadership and dissolved the board of directors. Musk also recently fired some employees for criticizing him in tweets or on internal Slack channels.\n\n“I don’t want to stick around to build a product that’s being poisoned from the inside and out,” said one of the employees who plans to reject the ultimatum, but requested anonymity to avoid putting the severance at risk. “Everyone has a price to a certain degree and this severance gives me some comfort into looking for a better environment in the time frame despite the economy.”\n\nThat employee said management now appears to have grown concerned about the number of people planning to depart and are “scrambling” to convince talent to stay. Twitter, which has reportedly eliminated most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Twitter employee, who asked not to be quoted, shared similar concerns and said they planned to also exit the company.\n\nA recently laid off employee who remains in touch with former coworkers told CNN that everyone they had spoken to plans to reject Musk’s ultimatum and exit the company. “People can’t overlook the public mockery and firing of other employees,” the former employee told CNN. “In the same vein, they can’t overlook or feel comfortable working for someone who has handled the last few weeks in the way Elon has.”\n\n“People don’t want to sacrifice their mental health and family lives to make the richest man in the world richer,” the former employee added.\n\nBut the decision may not be so easy for others. The ultimatum comes during a difficult period for the tech industry, following mass layoffs and hiring freeze announcements at many major firms including Meta, Amazon, Lyft and others. Employees working in the United States from other countries could also risk losing their work visas if they leave the company.\n\nA fourth employee told CNN Thursday they plan to stay at the company “because change is rarely influenced from the outside.”\n\nThe shakeup likely to come as a result of the ultimatum will be the last element of the “fundamental organizational restructuring” following Musk’s takeover, he told a Delaware court Wednesday during a trial over his Tesla pay package.\n\nMusk said in the Wednesday email that the “new Twitter” will be “much more engineering-driven,” leaving some non-engineering workers questioning whether their jobs could be at risk even if they opt to stay.\n\n“There’s no assurance in this, you’re just like, ‘I might be able to advocate for myself, I might not,’” the employee who expressed uncertainty about the decision said. “What’s behind this door? You don’t know. The only door you know that’s certain is the exit door.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Oliver Darcy", "Clare Duffy", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/twitter-layoffs/index.html", "title": "Twitter layoffs: Elon Musk's Twitter cuts jobs across the company ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nTwitter on Friday laid off thousands of employees in departments across the company, in a severe round of cost cutting that could potentially upend how one of the world’s most influential platforms operates one week after it was acquired by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nNumerous Twitter employees began posting on the platform Thursday night and Friday morning that they had already been locked out of their company email accounts ahead of the planned layoff notification. Some also shared blue hearts and salute emojis indicating they were out at the company.\n\nBy Friday morning, Twitter employees from departments including ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, wellness and other teams had tweeted about having been let go. Members of the curation team, which help elevate reliable information on the platform, including about elections, were also laid off, according to employee posts.\n\n“Just got remotely logged out of my work laptop and removed from Slack,” one Twitter employee said on the platform. “So sad it had to end this way.”\n\nAnother employee said that she and other members of Twitter’s human rights team had been laid off. The employee added that she is proud of the team’s work “to protect those at-risk in global conflicts & crises including Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, and to defend the needs of those particularly at risk of human rights abuse by virtue of their social media presence, such as journalists & human rights defenders.”\n\nSimon Balmain, a former Twitter senior community manager who was laid off Friday, said in an interview with CNN that he lost access to Slack, email and other internal systems around 8 hours before receiving an email Friday morning officially notifying him that he’d been fired. He added that the lay off email “still didn’t provide any details really” about why he’d been let go.\n\n“The waves of annoyance and frustration and all that stuff are absolutely mitigated by the extreme solidarity we’ve seen from people that are in the company, people that are in the same position, people that left the company in years gone by,” Balmain said. “It’s like a giant support network, which has been absolutely amazing.”\n\nOne Twitter employee who was laid off told CNN Friday that some workers are relieved to have been let go. “For me, being safe would’ve been punishment,” the employee said.\n\nWhile Twitter employees were posting about being laid off, Musk on Friday appeared for a friendly interview at an investor conference and spoke about making cheaper electric vehicles and his ambitions to go to Mars. During the interview, Musk said of Twitter, “I tried to get out of the deal,” but then added, “I think there is a tremendous amount of potential … and I think it could be one of the most valuable companies in the world.”\n\nThe interviewer said that Musk had laid off “half of Twitter” and Musk nodded, although he did not comment on the remark.\n\n(In a series of tweets Friday evening, Yoel Roth, head of Twitter’s trust and safety team, confirmed overall headcount was cut by roughly 50%. The layoffs eliminated 15% of the company’s trust and safety team, leading to reductions in customer service but little change to content moderation, according to Roth. )\n\nIn his interview, Musk appeared to frame the sweeping layoffs as necessary for a company that, like other social media firms, was experiencing “revenue challenges” prior to his acquisition as advertisers rethink spending amid recession fears.\n\nMusk also said “a number of major advertisers have stopped spending on Twitter” in the days since the acquisition was completed.\n\nElon Musk spoke at an investment conference Friday morning as employees at Twitter, which he now owns, were receiving notifications that they had been laid off from the company. Baron Capital\n\nTwitter had about 7,500 workers prior to Musk’s takeover, meaning roughly 3,700 employees were laid off. The cuts come as Musk attempts to improve the company’s bottom line after taking out significant debt financing to fund his $44 billion acquisition.\n\nThe email sent Thursday evening notified employees that they would receive a notice by 12 p.m. ET Friday that informs them of their employment status.\n\n“If your employment is not impacted, you will receive a notification via your Twitter email,” a copy of the email obtained by CNN said. “If your employment is impacted, you will receive a notification with next steps via your personal email.”\n\nThe email added that “to help ensure the safety” of employees and Twitter’s systems, the company’s offices “will be temporarily closed and all badge access will be suspended.”\n\nThe email concluded acknowledging that it will be “an incredibly challenging experience to go through” for the workforce.\n\nSeveral Twitter employees on Thursday night filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Twitter is in violation of the federal and California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) after laying off some employees already. The complaint was later amended to acknowledge that while several of the plaintiffs did ultimately receive sufficient notice of their termination under the WARN Act, Twitter still allegedly failed to give sufficient notice in the case of some employees.\n\nThe WARN Act requires that an employer with more than 100 employees must provide 60 days’ advanced written notice prior to a mass layoff “affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment.”\n\n“Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has made clear that he believes complying with federal labor laws is ‘trivial,’” Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement to CNN. “We have filed this federal complaint to ensure that Twitter be held accountable to our laws and to prevent Twitter employees from unknowingly signing away their rights.”\n\nWARN notices were filed by Twitter on Friday for nearly 1,000 impacted employees at the company’s various California offices.\n\nSeparately, other labor lawyers told CNN Friday they had begun receiving inquiries from Twitter employees questioning whether their terminations may have been unlawfully discriminatory or retaliatory.\n\n“Former Twitter employees have reached out to us regarding their layoffs and their circumstances, and so we’re looking at all the issues — beyond appropriate notice — and to make sure the employee wasn’t laid off due to their membership in a protected category,” said Chauniqua Young, a partner at the law firm Outten & Golden.\n\nBeyond the potential for lawsuits arising from the layoffs, other legal experts say Musk’s handling of the cuts may well create further problems for him down the road — whether in terms of attracting future talent or by keeping remaining workers satisfied.\n\n“Once you treat people like this, they remember that,” said Terri Gerstein, a fellow at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program and Economic Policy Institute. “Of the people remaining, it is a certainty that none of them feel secure in their job, and I would be shocked if the remaining people were not updating their resumes right now or talking with each other about starting a union.”\n\nMusk started his tenure at Twitter by firing CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision.\n\nAnd in less than a week since Musk acquired the company, its C-suite appears to have almost entirely cleared out, through a mix of firings and resignations. Musk has also dissolved Twitter’s former board of directors.\n\nMany staffers on Friday summed up their feelings with a hashtag, #LoveWhereYouWorked, a past-tense play on one previously often used by Twitter employees.\n\n- Brian Fung and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/tech/twitter-unbanned-users-returning/index.html", "title": "The mass unbanning of suspended Twitter users is underway | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThousands of previously banned Twitter users, including members of the far-right and users sharing blatant misinformation, have begun to have their accounts restored to the platform, according to an independent analysis.\n\nThe mass restoration of accounts comes after new owner Elon Musk said late last month that he would offer “general amnesty” to many who had been removed from the platform. In following through on that commitment, however, Musk risks further alienating other users and advertisers, and exacerbating concerns among watchdog groups about the rise of hate speech on the platform under his ownership (a fact Musk has attempted to refute).\n\nAmong those recently unbanned are a range of large and small accounts, including users promoting NFTs and cryptocurrencies, users tweeting about sports, many users tweeting in languages other than English, as well as both users that appear to be left-leaning and pro-Trump, according to observations by CNN.\n\nBut the restored accounts also include far-right figures such as Andrew Anglin, a self-professed white supremacist who founded the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, and Patrick Casey, who is associated with the far-right group “America First” and was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee for his involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nA number of accounts restored in recent days, including many with thousands of followers, used their first tweets in years to thank Musk for allowing them back on the platform, according to a review of their posts by CNN. Some also quickly began sharing conspiracy theories about issues such as Covid-19 and the 2020 US Presidential election.\n\nA data set of many of the unbanned accounts compiled by researcher and software developer Travis Brown, who worked for Twitter for a year in 2014 and last year began a project tracking hate speech on the platform, shows dozens of users who have had their bans reversed are using QAnon-related phrases or hashtags in their account bios. The dataset was built using Twitter’s API and a tool Brown had originally built to observe and track high-profile Twitter suspensions.\n\nThe accounts that have been restored includes “a really strange mix of accounts” that includes apparent far-right extremists and QAnon adherents, but also, for example, a Miley Cyrus fan account that has been repeatedly suspended and appears aimed mostly at growing a large following, Brown said.\n\nBut Brown added that other accounts he has observed as part of his hate speech tracking project have yet to be reinstated, raising questions about the criteria Twitter is using to restore previously banned accounts, although it’s possible Musk’s reinstatement process will take time. Many users on Twitter have also raised questions about Musk’s move last week to again suspend Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, while restoring the accounts of other white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. In another instance, Musk tweeted that he would not restore Alex Jones’s account because of a personal preference.\n\n“I’ve found it really hard … to generalize about how and why certain accounts are allowed back,” Brown said.\n\nTwitter, which has made substantial cuts to its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment and questions on the number of previously banned accounts restored or its process for doing so.\n\nMusk said last month that he would begin restoring most previously banned accounts to the platform, after having polled his Twitter followers about whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” The poll, which garnered more than three million votes, finished with more than 72% voting in favor of the proposition. It is not clear how Musk and Twitter’s remaining staff are sorting out which accounts were banned for spam or illegal activity.\n\nThe new Twitter owner had already begun to restore the accounts of some prominent, controversial users that had previously been banned or suspended from the platform, most notably former President Donald Trump, as well as conservative Canadian podcaster and all-beef diet promoter Jordan Peterson and the right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee.\n\nSome of the accounts restored in the latest wave have already raised concerns from civil rights groups. The Anti-Defamation League on Monday described as “deeply disturbing” Twitter’s decision to allow Anglin back on the platform.\n\n“The return of extremists to the platform has the potential to supercharge the spread of extremist content and disinformation, and this in turn could lead to the increased harassment of users,” Yael Eisenstat, vice president of ADL’s Center for Technology and Society said in a statement to CNN. “Musk’s actions to date show that he is not committed to a transparent process that incorporates the best practices we have learned from civil society groups.”\n\nBefore taking over Twitter, Musk said he disagreed with the platform’s policy of permanent bans, which were typically doled out only after a user had received a number of “strikes” for repeatedly violating Twitter’s policies, including those against Covid-19 or civic integrity misinformation.\n\nShortly after acquiring the company, Musk said he would create a “content moderation council” prior to making major changes, but there is no evidence such a group was ever formed or involved in the decisions to bring back violative accounts. Instead, Musk has appeared to make the decisions himself.\n\nMusk and Twitter have repeatedly stressed that the platform’s rules have not changed, despite restoring accounts that had repeatedly violated its rules and ceasing enforcement of the company’s policy prohibiting Covid-19 misinformation. In a blog post last month, Twitter said that its trust and safety team “remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.” Content that violates Twitter’s rules, it added, will be demoted on the platform.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who left the company following Musk’s takeover, criticized the billionaire Twitter owner’s top-down approach to content decisions in an interview with journalist Kara Swisher last month, suggesting that the platform had started to be run by “dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.” He also raised concerns about layoffs that hit Twitter’s safety teams.\n\nRestoring additional, previously banned accounts could exacerbate several big issues Twitter is currently facing. It could further alienate Twitter’s advertisers, many of whom have fled the platform in the wake of the chaos since Musk took over and out of fear that their ads could end up running alongside objectionable content. Musk has said the departure of key Twitter advertisers in recent weeks has led to a “massive drop in revenue” for the company.\n\nAds for major brands, including Kia, Amazon, Snap and Uber, have already begun to appear alongside tweets from reinstated accounts such as Anglin’s, according to reporting from the Washington Post and observations by CNN. (Kia told CNN it “continues to monitor the evolving Twitter environment and work closely with their teams on advertisement placement and usage.” The other brands did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.)\n\nIt could also draw more attention from Apple, which Musk previously tweeted had threatened to remove Twitter from its app store. Musk later said that the concern had been resolved following a meeting with Tim Cook, but Apple has previously shown a willingness to remove social media platforms from its app store over concerns about their ability to moderate hate speech and other potentially harmful content. Getting booted from Apple’s app store would be detrimental to Twitter’s business by making it harder for the iPhone maker’s more than one billion global customers to access the app, and difficult if not impossible for iPhone users to receive app updates.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}]}

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to a low of minus 14 on Thursday morning. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022.

Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Temperatures will be running 40 degrees below normal for these places. The combination of cold temperatures and windy conditions will send wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov.

The area saw blizzard-condition winds for nine consecutive hours and had zero visibility for 13 consecutive hours.\n\nPowerful winds instead blew loose snow from previous storms that winter from frozen Lake Erie onto land, creating huge snowdrifts and fully burying houses and cars alike.\n\n\"[The 1977] storm is the benchmark storm for the Buffalo area,\" Brian Thompson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told USA TODAY. \"This storm certainly seems like it now has become the deadliest storm in the Buffalo area.\"\n\nThompson noted decades of blizzards across the U.S. that have left hundreds dead, including the 1993 Storm of the Century, which killed more than 300 people in more than a dozen states. It is regarded as the second-most costliest winter storm on record, according to federal weather records.\n\n\"You don't think these winter storms can kill so many people but they're just as deadly,\" Thompson added.\n\nBuffalo deaths from winter storm rising\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz announced that the death toll from the Buffalo blizzard has risen and now stands at 34.\n\nA thaw may be coming Wednesday\n\nSome relief is in sight: On Wednesday, a warm front is expected to move across north central New York, raising temperatures above freezing, forecasters say.\n\nAshton Robinson Cook, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the bomb cyclone – when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm – has weakened. It developed near the Great Lakes, stirring up blizzard conditions.\n\nSome milder air has already made its way into western New York, and temperatures will rise over the next few days into the 40s and possibly even the 50s, according to Tom Kines, senior meteorologist at Accuweather.\n\n\"The news is generally good for that entire area over the next several days because it is warming up and there's no big snowstorms in sight,\" Kines told USA TODAY.\n\nThough the quick rise in temperature poses some minor flooding risk in the area, major flooding is unlikely without further precipitation, Kines said.\n\n(Claire Thornton and Cady Stanton, USA Today)\n\nNY Thruway to reopen after deadly winter storm\n\nThe New York State Thruway Authority announced Tuesday afternoon that Interstate 90 had reopened to all traffic from exit 46 (Henrietta) to the Pennsylvania line.

Blizzard-condition winds occurred for nine consecutive hours and zero visibility lasted for 13 consecutive hours.\n\nPowerful winds instead blew loose snow from previous storms that winter from frozen Lake Erie onto land, creating huge snowdrifts and fully burying houses and cars alike.\n\nIn the 1977 storm, 29 people died in four days, including 12 who were found frozen in stranded cars, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"This is a horrible situation,\" Poloncarz said Monday of the 2022 storm. \"The blizzard of 1977 lasted longer — it lasted three days of terrible conditions, this was two days of terrible conditions — but the ferocity of the storm was worse than the blizzard of 1977.\"\n\nNew York Gov.

Blizzard conditions expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 feet. Winds gusting as high as 70 mph Friday and Friday night. A rapid switch from rain to snow with sharply falling temperatures into the teens and single digits will result in a flash freeze on Friday. Blizzard conditions will develop Friday afternoon lasting into Saturday night.\n\nWinter storm warning issued for Monroe County in effect from Friday morning to Sunday morning. Heavy snow and strong winds expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 10 inches. Winds gusting as high as 60mph. A rapid switch from rain to snow with sharply falling temperatures into the teens and single digits will result in a flash freeze on Friday. From Friday afternoon through most of the weekend, very strong winds, lake effect snow, and blowing snow will produce localized blizzard conditions. Greatest snow accumulation across western portions of the county.\n\nWinter weather advisory issued for Wayne, Ontario counties\n\nWind chill warning issued for Steuben County\n\nOther alerts from the National Weather Service in Buffalo\n\nTemperatures are expected to rapidly drop into the teens on Friday across western New York, then strong, high winds are predicted to pick up by Friday evening and continue through most of the weekend. The warnings, watches and advisories run from Friday morning through Monday morning.\n\nSchool closures in Rochester NY\n\nThe Rochester City School District hcanceled classes for Friday because of the water main break and impending storm. At a Thursday press conference, County Executive Bello said he had spoken with officials from some suburban Monroe County districts and expects that many of those districts will be closed Friday, too.\n\nWeather Service meteorologists described the atmospheric event as a \"once-in-a-generation storm\" that could clobber the Rochester and Buffalo regions.\n\nHow much snow will Rochester NY get?\n\nThe Rochester region will likely see 6 to 10 inches of snow on Friday, as the temperature quickly drops, and potentially some flurries and light snow accumulation on Saturday, depending on the path of the storm.\n\nIt will also be cold this weekend, with highs expected in the upper teens. When considering the wind chill, it will feel far colder- around 10 to 20 degrees below zero.\n\nThere's also a risk of roads flash freezing on Friday, as rain is expected in Rochester Friday morning. Any wet surfaces will quickly freeze as the temperature drops 20 to 30 degrees throughout the day - from a predicted high of 45 down to the mid-teens.\n\nThe normal high in mid-December in Rochester is in the upper 30s.\n\nRoad conditions, travel advisories in Rochester NY\n\nBello is advising residents to stay off the roads starting Friday to make way for first responders and road-clearing operations. Salt trucks will be out in force. But the problem with this storm, officials said, is that rain will wash away some of the salt put down in advance, and below certain temperatures, salt loses its effectiveness in melting ice.\n\nFlight delays, cancellations at Rochester NY airport\n\nThe Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport has a history of being able to deal with winter weather, airport director Andy Moore said at the Thursday press conference. But he said hub airports in the Midwest, where the storm already has hit, are seeing cancellations.

Normally, the team flies into a city the day before a game, but the Bills recognized that will be impossible on Friday, so they’re leaving Buffalo Thursday night.\n\nRGE readies for power outages in Rochester NY region\n\nRegarding likely power outages, County Executive Bello pointed out that linemen will not be able to begin their restoration work until the winds die down, so “People should start making a plan for themselves today,\" he said. \"Make a plan for what you will do through the weekend if you lose power.”\n\nRochester Gas and Electric released the following statement on the storm:\n\nNew York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) are preparing for high winds associated with the winter storm that is expected to move across New York state on Thursday. As a result of the forecast, the companies have pre-staged additional line and tree personnel across the state to assist with restoration efforts, if needed. The storm has the potential to impact all of NYSEG and RG&E’s service areas, which includes Western New York, Rochester, Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, North Country, Capital Region, Hudson Valley and Westchester regions.\n\nCurrent forecasts call for wind gusts potentially reaching 60 mph in two stages on Friday and Saturday, as well as snow and ice, to begin late Thursday in Western New York and then move east across the state. The wind, ice, and snow have the potential to bring down trees and limbs, causing damage to overhead power lines and other electrical equipment. The companies urge customers to monitor local forecasts and prepare for the possibility of service interruptions.\n\nThe companies’ storm readiness teams have been monitoring weather forecasts, planning, readying crews and equipment, mobilizing employees for storm duty, and have additional contract tree and line crews ready to help restore service should outages occur.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-power-outages-sunday/index.html", "title": "Prolonged winter storm causes at least 37 deaths and leaves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe prolonged winter storm that brought heavy snow, high winds and brutal cold to most of the US this past week has killed at least 37 people and had hundreds of thousands without power on Christmas morning.\n\nPerhaps the worst impact was around Buffalo, New York, where 43 inches of snow fell as of Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service.

Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades. In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov.

Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time.

More than a foot more could fall Saturday, with winds gusting up to 65 mph and making temperatures feel well below zero.\n\nIn Erie County, which includes Buffalo, blizzard conditions are expected to continue through at least Sunday morning, County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Saturday. The winter storm could continue for at least the next 36 hours, with the blizzard warning in effect until 7 a.m. Christmas morning, Poloncarz said.\n\n“This is still a life-threatening situation,” he said. “This is nothing to be trifled with.”\n\nThe county’s Deputy Commissioner of Disaster Preparedness and Homeland Security, Gregory Butcher, said the storm will be significant “for days to come.”\n\nAbout 500 motorists found themselves stranded in their vehicles in Erie County Friday night into Saturday morning, and a “couple hundred” may still be trapped early Saturday afternoon, Poloncarz told CNN. That’s despite a county driving ban put in place during the storm.\n\nLia Belles’ 85-year-old grandmother and her father were among the stranded.\n\nThey have been stuck on New York State Route 198 in Buffalo – less than a mile from her home – since Friday afternoon. Contact with them is limited due to their phone battery, and they have been turning the heat on and off to save gas.\n\n“There is nothing more I want other than their safety right now,” Belles told CNN Saturday, adding that her dad could walk home but he would never leave his mother alone.\n\n“I’ve tried to walk out to them with a sled but conditions by myself were just impossible,” she said.\n\nBelles said by Saturday afternoon they got help getting the car unstuck but there was no path for them to leave.\n\n“It’s very nerve racking and difficult,” she said. “They’re definitely exhausted, but we’re seeing a little hope right now.”\n\nIn hardest-hit areas, many emergency crews that tried to reach the stranded became stuck themselves, Poloncarz said.\n\n“Don’t leave your home,” Poloncarz said on CNN Saturday to anyone thinking about traveling to or within the area. “It’s much safer to be inside, even if you lost your power with it only being 45 degrees inside, than going out and dealing with minus 20 wind chills and blinding conditions.”\n\nNational Guard troops were arriving Saturday to “rescue people that are stuck in vehicles,” and to give rides to medical workers so they could relieve colleagues who’d been working at hospitals for more than a day, Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo Diocese Bishop Michael W. Fisher on Saturday urged churches to livestream Christmas Mass because of the severe weather.\n\n“Although it is Christmas, in these dangerous conditions, no one should put themselves or others at risk,” he said via Twitter.\n\nEven where it wasn’t snowing and howling, temperatures and wind chills have been dangerously low across much of the country.\n\nFrom the Plains and the Midwest to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and even in parts of the Southeast, wind chills after the sun rose Saturday morning were below zero, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThat included:\n\n• Atlanta: 9 degrees; with minus 8 wind chill\n\n• Memphis: 10 degrees; with minus 4 wind chill\n\n• New York City: 8 degrees; with minus 8 wind chill\n\n• St. Louis: 9 degrees; with minus 12 wind chill\n\n• Washington, DC: 12 degrees; with minus 3 wind chill\n\nAt least 22 people have died since Wednesday across seven states, a result of dangerous and life-threatening conditions this week over a large swath of the country:\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building possibly looking for warmth, and another in a transient camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Kansas Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died in the state, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle accident in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a caravan slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New York: Erie County has had three storm-related deaths, county officials said Saturday.

The NFL delayed the start for an hour, and said it explored “every possibility to minimize non-essential power around the stadium.”\n\nSnow-covered buildings are seen in Louisville, Kentucky, under freezing temperatures on December 23.

Due to Buffalo’s airport being closed due to deep snow and strong winds, the team was forced to stay in Chicago an extra night. They are expected to fly to Rochester, New York, on Sunday, and travel back to Buffalo from there.\n\nWhat else to expect Christmas Eve\n\n• Cold for many: Wind chills will be dangerously cold across much of the central and eastern US this weekend. “The life-threatening cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills will create a potentially life-threatening hazard for travelers that become stranded,” the National Weather Service said early Saturday.\n\n• Record temps in the South: Atlanta and Tallahassee, Florida, were forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the weather service.\n\n• Brutal cold elsewhere: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were expected to see their coldest day Christmas Eve ever on Saturday. Washington, DC, could see its second-coldest on Christmas Eve, the first being in 1989. New York is set to experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1906.

Heavy snowfall and strong winds will set the stage for a blizzard, leading to whiteout conditions and impossible travel.\n\nBlizzard conditions are when there are sustained winds of 35 mph or higher and visibility below a quarter mile for at least three consecutive hours.\n\nWinter storm alerts stretch from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and blizzard warnings extend from just west of Denver into the Dakotas.\n\n“All preparations for this storm should be well underway and completed sooner rather than later,” the National Weather Service office in Rapid City said.\n\nSome locales inside the blizzard warning areas could pick up as much as 20 inches of snow. The winds could be strong enough to knock down tree limbs and cause power outages, and the harsh conditions could be deadly for anyone outdoors.\n\n“The cold wind chills, as low as 20 below zero, could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes,” the weather service office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, said.\n\nFarther east, ice warnings blanket eastern North Dakota, where nearly half an inch of ice could accumulate. If it materializes, power outages are certain and travel will be impossible.\n\nIcing is also possible across southwestern Minnesota and western Iowa, where as much as a tenth of an inch of ice could develop.\n\nEven Anchorage schools are closed\n\nWhile the Anchorage school district builds two snow days into the calendar, the system has been closed for four.\n\n“It’s very unusual. Unsafe road conditions have prevented us from returning to school,” Anchorage School District spokesperson MJ Thim said.\n\nThe current snow depth in Anchorage, Alaska, is 31 inches, making it the greatest since March 27, 2012, according to a tweet from Alaska climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.\n\nBetween 12 and 24 inches of snow fell in the region Sunday into Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. It was second significant snow storm in less than a week.\n\nThim said officials are looking at their options, including remote learning, depending on future snowfall totals.\n\nMultiday severe storm threat\n\nWhile the storm brings whiteout conditions to the North, the southern section of the storm will have the potential to bring late-season tornadoes along with strong thunderstorms.\n\nOn Monday evening, storms will fire up across western Kansas, as well as across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. The Storm Prediction Center is expecting storms to rapidly develop tonight, after dark.\n\nA Level 2 of 5 risk of severe weather has been issued for the area, including Oklahoma City and Norman in Oklahoma as well as Colby and Garden City in Kansas, and Wichita Falls in Texas.\n\n“Occasional damaging winds, isolated large hail, and a couple of tornadoes will be possible tonight,” the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nTrack the storms as they develop here.\n\nAs the storm system strengthens and pushes eastward on Tuesday, the possibility of damaging winds, hail, flash flooding and even strong tornadoes will be a concern for portions of the Deep South, especially central Louisiana and eastern Texas.\n\n“All modes of severe will be possible with damaging winds, hail and some more late fall tornadoes,” the weather service office in Shreveport said.\n\nShreveport, Monroe and Alexandria in Louisiana are in a Level 3 of 5 risk for severe weather.

There was a wind advisory in place until Wednesday evening and a high-surf advisory going into effect Thursday.\n\nAn atmospheric river happens when a line of warm, moist air flows from near the islands across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast, which falls as heavy rain when it reaches cooler air over land. These \"rivers in the sky\" can be more than 1,000 miles long and carry more water than the Mississippi River.\n\nIt all added up to further misery for a region that has endured a relentless string of atmospheric rivers since the final week of 2022.

Some areas already have received more than 10 feet of snow in the last two weeks.\n\n►The previous storm that walloped California was making its way east, and severe thunderstorms were possible in the Southeast on Thursday, forecasters said.

The woman had been found a day after she called 911 to report that the vehicle was stuck in floodwaters north of San Francisco, the department said.\n\nWhen the search resumed early Wednesday, divers discovered the car under about 10 feet of water off a rural road in the county, according to the department.\n\nAt least 18 people have died in the dangerous wave of storms. The figure is likely to rise, Newsom said Tuesday during his visit to the town of Capitola in Santa Cruz County, which was slammed by flooding creek waters and high surf conditions.\n\nWHAT IS AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER?These rivers of water vapor can extend thousands of miles.\n\nForecast: 4 more storms to hit Oregon, Washington, and California\n\nOfficials urged California residents to remain vigilant as more rain and storms are in the forecast. The National Weather Service's Bay Area office tweeted rain would continue Wednesday evening and new flooding was possible in North Bay.\n\n\"The weather is going to remain active over the next week, with chances for more thunderstorms Friday into the weekend,'' the weather service's Bay Area office said. Rain is also forecast to return to the Los Angeles area Saturday.\n\nFour more atmospheric rivers are heading toward the state in the next nine to 10 days, Gov. Gavin Newsom warned, before an expected dry stretch starting around Jan. 20. Newsom said more than half of the state's 58 counties have been declared disaster areas.\n\nThe first of those storms is expected to start in the Northwest, according to AccuWeather meteorologists. Parts of Oregon, Washington and Northern California will see some of the heaviest rain and snow through the end of this week.\n\nThe second, according to AccuWeather, may have impacts throughout California into the weekend, and will bring risks of flooding and gusty winds.\n\n\"Megadroughts. Wildfires. Historic floods and atmospheric rivers. This whiplash weather is not an anomaly,\" Newsom tweeted. \"California is proof that the climate crisis is real and we have to take it seriously.\"\n\nPositive signs amid the gloom\n\nAmid all the gloomy weather in much of California, there was some good news Wednesday: Power outages were down sharply across the state. About 62,000 homes and businesses were in the dark. About four times that many were without power Tuesday.\n\nAnd Santa Barbara County canceled all evacuation and shelter-in-place orders. That includes Montecito, home to Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities, where 23 people died and more than 100 homes were destroyed in a mudslide five years ago.\n\nIn addition, forecasters finally see the day when the state gets to dry out, at the end of next week.\n\n\"A sustained break is coming, but we still have a solid 7-10 days to go first,'' University of California, Los Angeles climate scientist Daniel Swain tweeted.\n\nOfficials continue search for 5-year-old swept away by floodwaters\n\nThe California National Guard said soldiers joined the search for 5-year-old Kyle Doan in San Luis Obispo County. The child vanished on Monday after he and his mother were stranded in a truck in rising waters. His mother was rescued, but Kyle was swept away.\n\nKyle's mother was driving him to kindergarten when flood waters started to overtake their SUV. She tried to get them both out of the vehicle, but lost hold of Kyle, who was swept away in the water. Nearby residents were able to rescue his mother.\n\nA seven-hour search Monday turned up only one of Kyle's sneakers. Authorities have been searching using breaks in weather since then, and the search continued Wednesday after ending Tuesday evening due to low visibility.\n\n“The hard thing to say to a lot of people at this point in time is, it’s not a rescue. It’s a recovery,” the boy's father, Brian Doan, told CNN on Wednesday, adding that authorities have not determined the search is a recovery officially. “And that’s something no parent wants to admit. And I kind of knew it after the first night… And it’s a hard, hard concept, especially when it’s your kid.”\n\nMore troops will arrive Thursday, the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nThousands of Californians remain displaced\n\nThousands of people across the state living near rain-swollen creeks and rivers remained under evacuation orders. In the San Joaquin Valley, Bear Creek flooded parts of the city of Merced and neighboring Planada along a highway to Yosemite National Park. All 4,000 residents of Planada were ordered to leave Tuesday. Neighborhoods were under water with cars submerged up to their roofs, and some residents carried away whatever they could salvage.\n\nOther evacuations were ordered prompted by a levee breach in parts of Monterey County. Repairs were underway.\n\n“We understand people are eager to get home but appreciate your patience while we keep these areas free for contractors,” Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said.\n\nGRAPHIC VIEW OF EPIC STORMS:Graphics show how the coastal state has been drenched\n\nIs the drought over? Not yet\n\nThe six atmospheric rivers that have soaked California in recent weeks, along with the three or four more to come, will ease concerns about a drought that has entered a fourth year. But the parade of storms won't by itself end the state's extended stretch of below-average rainfall.\n\nFor one, California's water reservoirs reached extremely low levels during the drought and are only now starting to recover. The biggest such cistern, Lake Shasta, was at 55% of its historical average on Christmas before rising to 70% by Tuesday, still considerably below its typical level for the date.\n\nIn addition, an impressive first part of the rainy season hardly guarantees continued precipitation. State residents got such a reminder last year when major October and December storms appeared to signal the drought was over, only for California to experience the driest January-to-March stretch in recorded history.\n\nWhen the Sierra snowpack – which serves as a natural water storage until the spring melt-off – was measured at its traditional peak in early April, it registered only 38% of the historic average.\n\n“We are not out of the drought yet,” said Laura Feinstein, who leads work on climate resilience and environment at SPUR, a public policy nonprofit.\n\nSacramento's 'City of Trees' causes damage amid storms\n\nCalifornia's capital city is known for the many trees that fill up its parks and line its streets. But persistent storms in Sacramento that have hit the so-called “City of Trees” and other parts of the state have damaged homes, vehicles and power lines with uprooted trees toppling over.\n\nMore than 1,000 trees have fallen in Sacramento since the New Year's Eve storm, said Gabby Miller, a spokesperson for the city’s Department of Public Works. The city's trees help to cool down temperatures during sweltering hot summers, but also to help control flooding.\n\nTwo trees outside Niki Goffard and her boyfriend's house fell early Sunday morning, one on their roof. Part of the roof above their bedroom caved in and fell on top of Goffard’s boyfriend, causing some minor scrapes and bruises.\n\n“You never think something like this is going to happen to you,” Goffard said. “It’s been quite shocking and traumatizing.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/26/weather/arctic-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-monday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm death toll in Buffalo area rises to 27 but officials fear it ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDozens of Americans have died have died as a winter storm brought frigid temperatures and paralyzing snowfall totals across the US, and officials in the Buffalo area believe the staggering toll will continue to grow there as teams carry on with search-and-rescue missions.\n\nThe nationwide death toll from storm, which brought more than 40 inches of snow to some areas, climbed to 49 on Monday, with 27 of those deaths in Erie County, New York.\n\nBuffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Unfortunately, they are still recovering bodies.”\n\nSome died of exposure, and some deaths were due to natural causes, he said of the people found dead recently.\n\nThe commissioner implored residents, “Stay home. Don’t go out.”\n\nHe said emergency responders will go, and have gone, to homes without heat and take people to warming shelters. Too many people, including residents just going out to see the massive snowfall, are going out in their vehicles and getting stuck and blocking recovery efforts, he said.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted that 14 people in the county had died of exposure, three people were found in their vehicles, four had no heat, three were from “shoveling/(snow) blowing cardiac events, and three people passed away after EMS services were delayed.\n\nHe told CNN that unfortunately it appears the numbers will go up.\n\n“I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue,” he told The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve had so many bodies that various hospitals are full and we’re just having to go through and determine if the individuals have died from a blizzard-related death.”\n\n“It’s just been a horrible, horrible situation,” he added.\n\nThe deadly storm comes just one month after the region was slammed with a historic snowstorm.\n\nAnd snow was continuing to fall Monday. At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas. Eleven abandoned ambulances were dug out Sunday, officials said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See houses frozen over by massive winter storm 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n“We had to send specialized rescue crews to go get the rescuers,” Poloncarz told “CNN This Morning” Monday, adding it was the worst storm he could remember. “It was just horrendous, and it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\n“We’re used to snow here, we can handle snow,” he said. “But with the wind, the blinding views – it was complete whiteouts – and the extreme cold, it was some of the worst conditions that any of us have ever seen.”\n\nSnow covers downtown Buffalo, New York, on Monday, December 26, 2022, in this photo from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's Twitter page. Gov. Kathy Hochul/Twitter/AP\n\nThe storm has drawn widespread comparisons to Buffalo’s famous blizzard of 1977. Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasts show an additional 8 to 16 inches of snow could fall, according to the National Weather Service. Erie County could see another 4 to 8 inches and is under a winter weather advisory.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nStorm leads to loss of life across multiple states\n\nOver the past week, the prolonged winter storm has enveloped a large swath of the country with dangerously low temperatures and wind chills, also bringing with it widespread power outages and thousands of canceled flights.\n\nAbout 25,700 customers were without power Monday evening in New York and Maine, according to PowerOutage.US. Since the start of the storm, the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nElectricity was not the sole utility impacted: Jackson, Mississippi, issued a boil water notice Sunday after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks “likely caused by the weather,” officials said on Facebook.

Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/26/winter-storm-snow-death-toll-rises-buffalo/10953148002/", "title": "Winter snow storm death toll rises, Buffalo, NY, could see more snow", "text": "The death toll from a historic onslaught of winter weather across the U.S. rose to at least 50 Monday as frigid arctic air and heavy lake-effect snow left large swaths of the U.S. frozen.\n\nThe pre-Christmas winter storm left at least 28 dead in western New York – one of the worst weather-related disasters in the region's history after the area was pummeled with as much as 43 inches of snow.\n\nThe dead have been found in their cars, homes and in snowbanks. Some died while shoveling snow. The death toll across the country was expected to rise as many remained without power in the frigid temperatures and hazardous road conditions continue.\n\nBuffalo, New York, has seen some of the worst damage from the storm, including hurricane-force winds and whiteout conditions from snow that left emergency response vehicles stranded on highways and roads.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz described the blizzard as “the worst storm probably in our lifetime” and warned there may be more dead. Some people, he noted, were stranded in their cars for more than two days.\n\n“This is a once-in-a-lifetime, generational blizzard,” he said of the impacts to the county, which includes Buffalo. “And this is not the end yet.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke by phone to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday, offering federal assistance to the state as it recovers from the storm.\n\nWhile warmer temperatures are forecast for later in the week, the area is still expected to receive 6 to 12 inches more of heavy, lake-effect snow between Monday and Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service station in Buffalo.\n\nMuch of New England and the Eastern coast will remain in a deep freeze until more moderate temperatures arrive Tuesday, the weather service said Monday, and lake-effect snow could continue to cause travel hazards until they slowly improve later in the week.\n\nMORE:Buses with migrants have dropped off outside of VP Harris' house before. Why Christmas Eve was different.\n\nSnowstorm is Buffalo's worst in 4 decades, rivals historic 1977 storm\n\nOfficials in Erie County compared the storm to what is widely known as Buffalo's worst blizzard in January 1977, which saw surprisingly little snowfall but brought sustained, deadly cold temperatures into the area for weeks.\n\nOnly 12.3 inches of new snow fell at the Buffalo Airport during the 1977 blizzard, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center, compared to more than 40 inches in this week's storm. Blizzard-condition winds occurred for nine consecutive hours and zero visibility lasted for 13 consecutive hours.\n\nPowerful winds instead blew loose snow from previous storms that winter from frozen Lake Erie onto land, creating huge snowdrifts and fully burying houses and cars alike.\n\nIn the 1977 storm, 29 people died in four days, including 12 who were found frozen in stranded cars, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"This is a horrible situation,\" Poloncarz said Monday of the 2022 storm. \"The blizzard of 1977 lasted longer – it lasted three days of terrible conditions, this was two days of terrible conditions – but the ferocity of the storm was worse than the blizzard of 1977.\"\n\nIn the case of this year's storm, sustained cold temperatures and high winds can make the storm even more challenging, according to Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at Accuweather.\n\n\"Even in areas where you do clean the snow off, they can just blow right back onto roads and sidewalks. On top of that, you're dealing with a lot of power outages due to the wind,\" he said. \"That makes it very difficult to deal with.\"\n\nRelief on the way? Forecast for warmer temperatures, power restorations\n\nOver the holiday weekend, extreme weather stretched coast to coast and from Canada down to Mexico. In total, about 60% of the U.S. population faced some sort of winter weather advisory or warning, with temperatures plummeting drastically below normal in many areas.\n\nBut forecasts for the days leading up to the New Year show some promise of warmer weather. Residents in the Buffalo area and swaths of the country can expect warmer temperatures in the later portion of the week, according to Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather.\n\n\"The trend is going to be for warmer weather for the upcoming week. In fact, Buffalo could easily get up in the 40s at some point during the second half of the week,\" Kines said.\n\nPower outages, flight cancellations across the US\n\nPower outages from coast-to-coast continued to be steadily restored Monday, addressing some concerns for residents trapped in their homes without electricity and heat. Fewer than 100,000 customers were still without power as of 3 p.m. EDT Monday, according to poweroutage.us, down from a peak of 1.7 million.\n\nEven with steady progress on power restorations and storm cleanup, more than 3,500 flights were cancelled within, into, or out of the U.S. for Monday, according to FlightAware.\n\nFlight delayed or canceled?:What you need to know and what airlines owe travelers.\n\nFrom Tennessee to Michigan, storm and cold wreak havoc\n\nCold temperatures and high winds caused damage across the country, leading to water main breaks, power outages and abnormal cold and dangerous travel conditions.\n\nIn Tennessee, 23 water mains broke as a result of the storm, according to the state's utility company, and 19 have since been repaired. Parts of Tennessee and Mississippi remained under boil-water advisories because of water lines bursting in the frigid temperatures.\n\nVirginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee all saw power outages, and Florida saw unusually low temperatures throughout the weekend because of the cold, according to Pydynowski.\n\n\"Just how widespread the cold was and how intense it was, was very impressive,\" he said.\n\nSix motorists were killed in crashes in Missouri, Kansas and Kentucky, and a Vermont woman died after struck by a falling branch. Police in Colorado said they found the dead body of a person who appeared to be unhoused while the area was experiencing subzero temperatures.\n\nWhat is lake-effect snow?\n\nLake-effect snow, which can last for only a few minutes to several days, develops from narrow bands of clouds that form when cold, dry arctic air passes over a large, relatively mild lake.\n\nIn the case of Buffalo, the city is in close proximity to Lake Erie, and ranks among the nation's snowiest big cities as a result.\n\nDuring this week's storm, the air mass over Lake Erie was \"extremely cold\" over the relatively warm waters of the lake, with winds that set up a snow band dumping intense snow for days, according to Pydynowski.\n\n\"Both Lake Erie and Ontario just produced a very intense lake effect snow,\" he said. \"Not only are you dealing with heavy snow, you're dealing with blizzard conditions ... all those factors combined to make a very intense outbreak that's finally just letting up now.\"\n\nDig deeper\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Joel Shannon, Wyatte Grantham-Phillips, Marina Pitofsky, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}]}

In the spirit of giving, thousands of well-meaning people search for opportunities to volunteer at soup kitchens or food banks on Thanksgiving day each year.\n\nHere’s why you shouldn’t.\n\n“If you really want to volunteer, pick any day, but don’t pick Thanksgiving or the day after Thanksgiving,” said Eileen Heisman, CEO and President of the National Philanthropic Trust.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to argue that you shouldn’t volunteer on a day that literally has “giving” in the name, but Heisman explained that many charities, especially smaller ones, can be overwhelmed by an influx of one-time volunteers. It takes charities time and resources to train volunteers, she said, and making a long-term commitment is the best way to help.\n\nMary Lou Bozza, director of development at Haley House, a nonprofit that runs a soup kitchen in Boston, said that while charities do have volunteering lulls, the holidays aren't one of them.\n\n“We do have volunteer needs those days, but we often get so much interest that it's hard to manage that,” Bozza said.\n\nShe suggested finding other ways to give back, like donating to a holiday clothing drive.\n\nHeisman also encouraged people in the giving spirit to donate their time or money on #GivingTuesday, a global charitable campaign on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.\n\n“Giving money is always wonderful,” she said. “If you do have the ability to raise money, think about giving a cash gift.”\n\nBefore you make any commitment, do your research. Heisman cautioned that not all charities have the resources to utilize volunteer labor effectively.\n\n\"Inventory really carefully the kinds of organizations that touch your heart and make a few phone calls,\" she said.\n\nAnd remember, you aren't just limited to soup kitchens and food pantries.\n\nThere are hundreds of seasonal volunteer opportunities, including turkey trots — road races on or around Thanksgiving that raise money for local charities — said Greg Baldwin, President of VolunteerMatch, a nonprofit that connects volunteers and charities.\n\n\"There's lots of skilled volunteer opportunities that people might not think about for photographers, DJs, web development folks,\" Baldwin said. Spending a few hours doing organizational work, like helping a local food pantry create a website or sort out its finances, can potentially be more helpful than simply serving food.\n\nBaldwin added that charities really need help in early spring and summer months when there are fewer volunteers.\n\n“We’re trying to use the holidays as much as we can as a point of entry for people to get involved throughout the remainder of the year,” he said.\n\nUse the holiday to to think about where you can really be effective and make a real commitment. Remember, Baldwin said, charities are open year-round.\n\n\"They need help all the time, not just when people are reminded of that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/03/01/neenah-man-mission-help-feed-hungry-fox-valley/376275002/", "title": "Good Neighbors: Neenah's Iott says food is 'hidden need in the Valley'", "text": "Linda Dums\n\nFor USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nGreg Iott of Neenah is seeing his research pay off.\n\nShortly after retiring, Iott, 66, wanted to commit time to volunteering. He wanted something that was ongoing and would “address what I feel is a critical need.”\n\nHunger is a growing need, he noted.\n\n“There is a need for supplemental food assistance,” he said. “It’s a hidden need in the Valley.”\n\nHe knew about St. Joseph Food Program but researched the nonprofit organization and found he agreed with its mission.\n\n“It’s a very needed organization,” said Iott, noting the “caring, compassionate and dedicated staff and volunteers.”\n\nIott has been volunteering two days a week for three years. He is one of the leads in the produce crew. He helps to unload the trucks and works to carefully sort through the donations, determining what can be repackaged and given to clients and what can be recycled.\n\n“The staff that is there are very focused on what they do,” he said, noting that 95 percent of the donations go directly to the client.\n\nIott is also eager to help the organization run efficiently and effectively, like a lean organization. Last year, the pantry distributed four million pounds of food that was donated or purchased, Iott said.\n\n“The other thing that we do is recycle everything we can,” he said. “If we have food we can’t use, we have an arrangement with local farmers with livestock,” where the unused food is fed to them.\n\nThe pantry also partners with other organizations that provide food assistance or meals to those in need.\n\n“I’ll work with them and understand what they need for food and they will use that in their programs for the meals,” said Iott. “There is a big outreach program a lot of people don’t realize that is beyond the pantry. That kind of a broader reach that goes beyond serving the number of clients we serve a week.”\n\nRELATED:Giving spirit, not Down syndrome, defines Appleton volunteer\n\nRELATED:Fox Valley volunteer opportunities\n\nIott enjoys working and socializing with the other volunteers.\n\n“We have a good time there,” he said. “You work hard for the six hours you are there. What we are doing there is having an impact.”\n\nHe is fortunate to be able to help, he said.\n\n“I do have a great life,” said Iott, who worked in marketing and sales for many years with RR Donnelly and finished his career life with AIA Corp. in Neenah. “There are a lot of people who have not had the same luck and opportunity. If there is something I can do to make their life better, then I will do it. It’s only a matter of luck and circumstance and I could be on the other side of the counter as well.”\n\nLeah Thibodeau, volunteer engagement leader, said Iott is invaluable to the organization, from the produce crew to his work with the other agencies.\n\n“He offers not just his help, but a friendly smile, and the ability to troubleshoot any issues that might arise,” she said. “The other volunteers quickly grew to look to Greg for both guidance and support.”\n\nFor volunteer information, contact Leah Thibodeau, volunteer engagement leader at St. Joseph Food Program at 920-734-9461, ext. 313, or visit www.stjoesfoodprogram.org.\n\nLinda Dums can be reached at pcfeatures@postcrescent.com\n\nMeet the volunteers\n\nEach Friday on the Good Neighbors page we introduce you to a volunteer in the Fox Valley.

He began volunteering to deliver Meals On Wheels several days a week, and he has been doing it ever since.\n\nHe loves getting to know the people he serves. \"I visit with them and ask them how they are doing. I realize for a lot of people, I may be their only contact for the day.\"\n\nHe also cooks and helps serve meals for funerals at his church, and he and his wife, Elaine, spearhead an effort for their church to feed the homeless in Minneapolis.\n\nZimmer says he gets a lot of satisfaction from doing all this, knowing that he's \"contributing in a small way, making someone else's life a little happier. I try to give back as much as I can.\"\n\nVolunteering is not only good for others, it's good for you.\n\nResearch shows that people who volunteer report lower mortality rates, lower rates of depression, fewer physical limitations and lower levels of stress than those who don't volunteer, says Wendy Spencer, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that administers Senior Corps, AmeriCorps and other programs. \"The health benefits are huge.\"\n\nData from the agency found that more than 20 million older adults — more than a quarter of those 55 and older — contributed on average more than 3 billion hours of service in their communities per year from 2011 to 2013. The value of this service is estimated at $75 billion.\n\nDeborah Moore Jaquith of AARP's Experience Corps, a national program that provides volunteer reading tutors to children in the younger grades, says the group's annual survey found that \"97% of our volunteers indicated that the work gives them a sense of life purpose.\"\n\nThat's the case for Robert Rouse, 52, a retired firefighter in Washington, D.C. For several years, he has been reading to children at a local elementary school as well as helping out with administrative and custodial jobs when needed, and for the past two years he has been coordinating the school's Experience Corps tutors.\n\nHe says the work gives him something to look forward to every day, and it's mentally stimulating to help in different grades. \"Every day is different. I get to share with the kids and learn with them.\"\n\nSpencer says there are several keys to making the most of volunteering:\n\n• Look for activities that fit into your schedule. Many retirees need to find activities that are flexible enough they have time for the other things that are really important to them. For some people volunteering about 20 hours a week still leaves plenty of time for the other things they want to do in retirement, she says.\n\nIn fact, some retirees may not start volunteering until about a year into their retirement, Spencer says. After spending their entire lives working, some people want a break from responsibilities and commitments for a while, she says. \"They may think, 'I have been so committed and had to be responsible to others all my life, and I want a break. If I volunteer, I want to step into an organization that I'm not going to feel guilty if I don't show up the next day.'\"\n\nSo Spencer urges non-profits to be flexible with retirees.\n\n• Find an activity you're passionate about. Like kids? Volunteer to help children. Care about the homeless? Spend time at a soup kitchen. Like to work with your hands? Help fix homes in the neighborhood. Volunteering works best if you choose an area you love.\n\n\"Some people have sat behind a desk all their life, and want to work with their hands in retirement,\" Spencer says. \"What's beautiful about volunteering is that when you do find your niche, it can be the most satisfying experience. It can be your new purpose in life if it's the right activity. You feel recognized and appreciated.\"\n\n• Ask a friend to volunteer with you. People are more likely to get involved in non-profit organizations and charities if they have someone to do it with them, Spencer says. \"There is something intimidating about walking into a new activity. They don't know what they are going to walk into.\" So find a neighbor or friend who is alone and take them with you.\n\n• Tell others about ways they can help. Some folks don't get involved until they are asked, she says. \"Many retirees are focused on their grandchildren, hobbies, fixing up their home and possibly traveling, and they stay in that world until they are asked. The good news is when people are asked to volunteer, they typically do,\" she says.\n\nFor example, there is a group of retired men in Denver who build entrance ramps into homes for people who need them. The group got started because one day the men were sitting together in a coffee shop, and someone came and asked them to help do this, Spencer says.\n\n• Realize it's never too late to get started. One foster grandparent volunteer in Washington, D.C., started at age 80 and is still going strong 25 years later at 105, Spencer says.\n\nJeffie Carter, 98, of Jackson, Miss., has been volunteering since she retired from teaching elementary school in 1983. She has done service through her church, AARP, Goodwill and the Salvation Army.\n\nAnd she's still going strong. She continues to ring the bell for the Salvation Army's red kettle to collect donations for those in need, and she also organizes other church members to do the same thing.\n\nThe reward for all she has done: \"You're helping others,\" she says. \"As long as you can help others, you don't think about yourself.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/23"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2015/10/28/tens-thousands-americans-unite-volunteerism-weekend/32575549/", "title": "TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS UNITE IN ...", "text": "Staff\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOriginally posted Oct. 29, 2015\n\nGannett's USA TODAY, TEGNA, Points of Light and Newman’s Own, Inc. sponsor the nation's largest day of volunteerism\n\nMcLean, Va.

Clothes, bibs, bottles, towels, blankets, diapers, wipes, lotion and books are packed up to give to moms who need help.\n\nA dozen Telamon employees spent the morning at the Catholic Charities organization, a United Way agency, as part of United Way's spring Day of Caring. The day of caring initiative leads into National Volunteer Week (April 12-18).\n\n\"Day of Caring gives people an opportunity to test out volunteering or participate in an annual tradition,\" said Alan Witchey, Volunteer Center director for United Way of Central Indiana. \"Either way, we hope it acts as an on-ramp to encourage people to volunteer throughout the year.\"\n\nMost of the people working in St. Elizabeth's former day-care room Friday weren't familiar with the agency, which once housed young, expectant moms who had nowhere to go. In 2007, state funding for the girls to live onsite was discontinued, but the agency still provides services to girls where they live.\n\n\"We helped 800 mothers and about 1,250 children with our donations last year,\" Kamrath said. \"As part of our adoption program, we work with about 150 young women each year who find themselves with an unplanned pregnancy. About 20 of them will make an adoption plan; the others will choose to parent their child, and that's fine. We're here to just support them.\"\n\nThe girls who choose to give their babies up for adoption receive lifelong services, Kamrath said. The agency hosts a birth mother luncheon every year to honor them, and it provides counseling, support groups and donations.\n\nVolunteers at St. Elizabeth, 2500 Churchman Ave., and other places around town are vital to Central Indiana, Witchey said.\n\n\"There are so many issues facing our community, and nonprofits simply can't solve them alone. They need volunteers to step up and be part of the solution.\"\n\nPeople like Alexa Amatulli, marketing coordinator for Telamon, who said her company puts an emphasis on volunteering.\n\n\"It's really important for us to be engaged in the community. It's a fun way to get our employees out working together and helping at the same time.\"\n\nJason Carrillo, vice president of engineering for Telamon, brought his whole family to volunteer at St. Elizabeth. His wife, Janel, and kids, Jaxon and Jiani, are adjusting to life in Indiana after moving from California in August.\n\n\"Telamon is our family here,\" he said. \"Getting involved with United Way and teaching our kids about giving was important.

We will continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like Hezbollah.”\n\nThe President said he would deliver that message to Saudi leadership when he travels to Saudi Arabia on Friday and said, “With regard to Iran and convincing the Saudis and others that we mean what we say is – we mean what we say.”\n\nBiden has pushed for a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key Middle East allies to produce a plan to contain Iran.

Diplomacy will not stop them. The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear program, the free world will use force. The only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table,” Lapid said.\n\nBiden said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 News that aired Wednesday that he would use force “as a last resort” to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but did not spell out what that meant.\n\nIran was a main topic of discussion during Biden and Lapid’s bilateral meeting on Thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration on Thursday aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. The President reiterated the US’ “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security.\n\nThe President expressed support for the Abraham Accords, one of Trump’s legacy achievements that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries and pursued an expansion of growing Arab-Israeli security and economic ties. He also emphasized the US’ support of expanding Israel’s integration into the region – a major theme of Biden’s four-day trip to the Middle East.\n\nBiden also reiterated his support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the news conference.\n\n“Israel must remain an independent, democratic Jewish state, the ultimate guarantee and guarantor of security of the Jewish people not only in Israel but the entire world. I believe that to my core,” Biden said.\n\nHe continued, “And the best way to achieve that remains a two-state solution for two people, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land living side-by-side in peace and security. Both states fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens, both people enjoying equal measures of freedom and any more that takes us further from that outcome I believe anything is detrimental to the long-term security of Israel.”\n\nThe US and Israel on Thursday also launched a new high-level strategic dialogue on technology, which officials say is designed to elevate cooperation between the two nations on pandemic preparedness, climate technology, artificial technology and other trusted technology ecosystems.\n\nThe President on Thursday also participated in the first virtual leaders meeting of the “I2U2” group, which also includes Israel, India, and the United Arab Emirates. The focus of Thursday’s meeting was food security as well as advancing clean energy, Biden said ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe UAE announced it was investing $2 billion in agricultural parks in India to tackle the food security crisis.\n\n“This unique grouping of countries aims to harness the vibrancy of our societies and entrepreneurial spirit to tackle some of the greatest challenges confronting our world, with a particular focus on joint investments and new initiatives in water, energy, transportation, space, health, and food security,” a joint statement from the leaders of India, Israel, United Arab Emirates and the United States reads.\n\nBiden met with President Isaac Herzog of Israel at his residence and was set to discuss Herzog’s diplomatic efforts to further integrate Israel into the region, officials said.\n\nHerzog presented Biden with the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor, and Biden said the award was “among the greatest honors of my career.”\n\nThe President will then meet with former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders have a relationship that spans nearly four decades that began when Biden was a junior senator. All the same, it has not always been smooth sailing between the two men. Netanyahu made no secret of his disregard for former President Barack Obama – the feeling, by all accounts, was mutual – and Biden was badly embarrassed when a visit to Israel as vice president in 2010 coincided with an Israeli government announcement approving plans for new settlement homes.\n\n“They, of course, go back many years and know each other well. And we are clear during this visit that the relationship between the United States and Israel is about the countries, our strategic partnership as two states – not about individual leaders,” one official said.\n\nBiden also met with US athletes competing in the Maccabiah Games, an international Jewish and Israeli multi-sport event, and viewed a portion of the opening ceremonies.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/politics/biden-middle-east-trip-takeaways/index.html", "title": "5 takeaways from Joe Biden's first presidential trip to the Middle East ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday capped a four-day trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, his first trip to the Middle East since taking office.\n\nThe President started his trip by meeting with Israeli leaders to expand security ties with the nation and discuss countering efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. He next went to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he attempted to reassure regional leaders – and the rest of the world – that his administration remains committed to actively engaging in the Middle East and not allowing Russia or China to expand their geopolitical influence.\n\nOn Friday, he sought a reset of relations with the Saudis as he looked for ways to lower high gas prices in the US, which have contributed to a significant drop in Biden’s approval ratings.\n\nThat reset began with a widely criticized fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, whom the US has accused of sanctioning journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Biden said he raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with the Crown Prince and indicated he believes MBS was responsible for it, as he emphasized the US commitment to human rights.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the trip:\n\nBiden’s fist bump with MBS signals a reset in US-Saudi relationship and draws fierce criticism\n\nAhead of his departure to the Middle East, administration officials had told CNN they were aiming for a full reset of the US-Saudi relationship after years of strain following Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nA fist bump in front of the cameras between Biden and the Crown Prince neatly symbolized that moment.\n\nThe meetings in Jeddah largely seemed to go along with the planned reset of the US relationship with the kingdom, and Biden announced several new areas of cooperation aimed at reshaping US-Saudi relations. But the images of Biden’s seemingly chummy interactions with the Crown Prince drew the most attention.\n\nThe President was fiercely criticized – including by fellow Democrats – for fist-bumping MBS during their first in-person interaction in Jeddah. Critics argued the fist bump helped rehabilitate the 36-year-old leader’s reputation on the world stage just over a year after the US declassified an intelligence report concluding that he personally ordered the brutal killing of Khashoggi, a charge the Crown Prince denied in their meeting, Biden said.\n\nThe images of the fist bump were quickly promoted by the Saudi government, including on Saudi state TV. Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said Biden’s fist bump was “shameful” because it “projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.”\n\nThere was much speculation ahead of the trip whether Biden would shake the Crown Prince’s hand, particularly when the White House said the President would be looking to reduce contact with others amid the spread of a transmissible subvariant of the omicron variant of Covid-19.\n\nBiden brings up Khashoggi’s killing with MBS and emphasizes American support for human rights\n\nHours after being criticized for that fist bump, the President went in front of the traveling press to say he had raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nBiden said he was “straightforward and direct” with MBS, adding that he indicated to the Crown Prince that he believed he was responsible for Khashoggi’s murder. A day earlier, while in Israel, Biden had stopped short of confirming that he planned to raise Khashoggi’s death with the Crown Prince, instead insisting that he “always” brought up human rights and that his views on the murder had been made “absolutely” clear.\n\nThe President reiterated that point on Friday.\n\n“For an American president to be silent on the issue of human rights is inconsistent with who we are and who I am. I’ll always stand up for our values,” Biden told reporters.\n\nOn Saturday, as he was making remarks to the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as leaders of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan, the President again touched on human rights as he sat beside Crown Prince Mohammed, calling the values enshrined in the UN charter “foundational to who we are as Americans” and encouraging the assembled leaders to allow more rights for women and the press.\n\n“I’ve gotten plenty of criticism over the years. It’s not fun. But the ability to speak openly, exchange ideas freely, is what unlocks innovation,” Biden said.\n\nBiden leaves Saudi Arabia without any public promises for increased oil production, but hints at private assurances\n\nBiden came to Jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home – high gas prices -- as diplomacy with the kingdom and other allies in the Middle East was seen as one of the few routes he could take to ease the pain at the pump. But, the trip did not produce any immediate announcements on increased oil production.\n\nThe trip came amid high gas prices and widespread inflation in the US and across the globe, in part due to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine that has been ongoing since February. The high gas and grocery prices in the US are putting stress on millions of Americans and represent a major political liability for Biden’s Democratic Party in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nWhile gas prices have been falling in recent weeks, high prices have become a thorn in Biden’s side. White House officials said in the lead-up to the Saudi leg of the trip that they did not expect to be leaving with promises of increased oil production, and that prediction came true by the time Biden left the kingdom on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the President did strike an optimistic note that regional leaders would soon take action given that the next OPEC meeting will take place in early August.\n\n“Based on our discussions today, I expect we’ll see further steps in the coming weeks,” Biden said Friday after hours of meetings with Saudi leadership.\n\nThe President attempts to reassure allies the US is committed to the Middle East\n\nBiden attempted to reassert US leadership in the Middle East during the GCC+3 summit Saturday with key leaders in the region and promised that his administration would stay actively engaged amid fears that China and Russia could swiftly fill a leadership vacuum.\n\nThe President’s foreign policy focus since taking office has largely been on countering China’s growing geopolitical influence and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has raised questions about the extent of Biden’s commitment to engagement in the Middle East.\n\n“The United States is invested in building a positive future in the region in partnership with all of you, and the United States is not going anywhere,” Biden said at the meeting with the GCC+3.\n\nThe summit came nearly one year after the US withdrew all military troops from Afghanistan and ended 20 years of war in the country. Biden also noted that his visit to the Middle East was the first time since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 that a US president had visited the region without American troops being engaged in combat in the area, though US forces continue to conduct operations in Syria.\n\nBiden has been under pressure to do more to counter Iran in the region and come up with a coordinated strategy among allies, and on Saturday he made a commitment to the US playing a large role in the Middle East for years to come.\n\n“Let me state clearly that the United States is going to remain an active and engaged partner in the Middle East,” he said.\n\nThe White House released a joint statement later Saturday that said all the meeting’s participants “affirmed their keenness to continue to hold the U.S.-GCC Summit annually.”\n\nBiden looks to diplomacy to block Iran from getting nuclear weapon despite Israeli skepticism\n\nDuring the first leg of his trip, in Israel, Biden repeatedly vowed to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon and said he believed diplomacy remained the best avenue to keep Tehran from obtaining one. His Israeli hosts were skeptical at best.\n\nBiden has pushed for a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key Middle East allies to produce a plan to contain Iran. But hopes appear to be fading that a deal will materialize, and the President acknowledged that the US is “not going to wait forever” for a response from Iranian leadership.\n\n“I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome,” Biden said at a news conference Thursday. “We will continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like Hezbollah.”\n\nStanding alongside Biden at that news conference was Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who was dismissive about another nuclear deal as the means to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n“Words will not stop them, Mr. President. Diplomacy will not stop them. The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear program, the free world will use force. The only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table,” Lapid said.\n\nIran was a main topic of discussion during Biden and Lapid’s bilateral meeting on Thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. The President reiterated the US’ “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/asia/asia-summits-apec-russia-vladimir-putin-bangkok-thailand-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "World leaders met all week to address global issues. Putin appears ...", "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN —\n\nThe three major summits of world leaders that took place across Asia in the past week have made one thing clear: Vladimir Putin is now sidelined on the world stage.\n\nPutin, whose attack on Ukraine over the past nine months has devastated the European country and roiled the global economy, declined to attend any of the diplomatic gatherings – and instead found himself subject to significant censure as international opposition to his war appeared to harden.\n\nA meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in Bangkok closed on Saturday with a declaration that references nations’ stances expressed in other forums, including in a UN resolution deploring “in the strongest terms” Russian aggression against Ukraine, while noting differing views.\n\nIt echoes verbatim a declaration from the Group of 20 (G20) leaders summit in Bali earlier this week.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Beyond logic': Retired general baffled by Russia's military move 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\n“Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy,” the document said, adding that there were differing “assessments” on the situation within the group.\n\nDiscussions within the summits aside, the week has also shown Putin – who it is believed launched his invasion in a bid to restore Russia’s supposed former glory – as increasingly isolated, with the Russian leader hunkered down in Moscow and unwilling even to face counterparts at major global meetings.\n\nA fear of potential political maneuvers against him should he leave the capital, an obsession with personal security and a desire to avoid scenes of confrontation at the summits – especially as Russia faces heavy losses in the battlefield – were all likely calculations that went into Putin’s decision, according to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMeanwhile, he may not want to turn unwanted attention on the handful of nations that have remained friendly to Russia, for example India and China, whose leaders Putin saw in a regional summit in Uzbekistan in September.\n\n“He doesn’t want to be this toxic guy,” Gabuev said.\n\nHardening views\n\nBut even among countries who have not taken a hardline against Russia, there are signs of lost patience, if not with Russia itself, than against the knock-on effects of its aggression. Strained energy, issues of food security and spiraling global inflation are now squeezing economies the world over.\n\nIndonesia, which hosted the G20, has not explicitly condemned Russia for the invasion, but its President Joko Widodo told world leaders on Tuesday “we must end the war.”\n\nIndia, which has been a key purchaser of Russia’s energy even as the West shunned Russian fuel in recent months, also reiterated its call to “find a way to return to the path of ceasefire” at the G20. The summit’s final declaration includes a sentence saying, “Today’s era must not be of war” – language that echoes what Modi told Putin in September, when they met on the sidelines of the summit in Uzbekistan.\n\nIt’s less clear if China, whose strategic partnership with Russia is bolstered by a close rapport between leader Xi Jinping and Putin, has come to any shift in stance. Beijing has long refused to condemn the invasion, or even refer to it as such. It’s instead decried Western sanctions and amplified Kremlin talking points blaming the US and NATO for the conflict, although this rhetoric has appeared to be somewhat dialed back on its state-controlled domestic media in recent months.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymir Zelensky addresses G20 leaders via video link from his office in Kyiv. Ukrainian President's Office\n\nIn sidelines meetings with Western leaders this past week, however, Xi reiterated China’s call for a ceasefire through dialogue, and, according to readouts from his interlocutors, agreed to oppose the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine – although those remarks were not included in China’s account of the talks.\n\nBut observers of China’s foreign policy say its desire to maintain strong ties with Russia likely remains unshaken.\n\n“While these statements are an indirect criticism of Vladimir Putin, I don’t think they are aimed at distancing China from Russia,” said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Xi is saying these things to an audience that wants to hear them.”\n\nSplit-screen\n\nRussian isolation, however, appears even more stark against the backdrop of Xi’s diplomatic tour in Bali and Bangkok this week.\n\nThough US President Joe Biden’s administration has named Beijing – not Moscow – the “most serious long-term challenge” to the global order, Xi was treated as a valuable global partner by Western leaders, many of whom met with the Chinese leader for talks aimed at increasing communication and cooperation.\n\nXi had an exchange with US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is representing the US at the APEC summit in Bangkok, at the event on Saturday. Harris said in a Tweet after she noted a “key message” from Biden’s G20 meeting with Xi – the importance of maintaining open lines of communication “to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.”\n\nAnd in an impassioned call for peace delivered to a meeting of business leaders alongside the APEC summit on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to draw a distinction between Russia’s actions and tensions with China.\n\nWhile referencing US-China competition and increasing confrontation in Asia’s regional waters, Macron said: “What makes this war different is that it is an aggression against international rules. All countries … have stability because of international rules,” before calling for Russia to come back “to the table” and “respect international order.”\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris meets with US allies at APEC following North Korea's ballistic missile launch on Friday. Haiyun Jiang/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe urgency of that sentiment was heightened after a Russian-made missile landed in Poland, killing two people on Tuesday, during the G20 summit. As a NATO member, a threat to Polish security could trigger a response from the whole bloc.\n\nThe situation defused after initial investigation suggested the missile came from the Ukrainian side in an accident during missile defense – but highlighted the potential for a miscalculation to spark a world war.\n\nA day after that situation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pointed to what he called a “split-screen.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback NATO must keep 'cool head' over missile incident in Poland, says Estonian PM 07:40 - Source: CNN\n\n“As the world works to help the most vulnerable people, Russia targets them; as leaders worldwide reaffirmed our commitment to the UN Charter and international rules that benefit all our people, President Putin continues to try to shred those same principles,” Blinken told reporters Thursday night in Bangkok.\n\nConsensus?\n\nComing into the week of international meetings, the US and its allies were ready to project that message to their international peers. And while strong messages have been made, gathering consensus around that view has not been easy – and differences remain.\n\nThe G20 and APEC declarations both acknowledge divisions between how members voted in the UN to support its resolution “deploring” Russian aggression, and say that while most members “strongly condemned” the war, “there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions.”\n\nEven making such an expression with caveats was an arduous process at both summits, according to officials. Indonesia’s Jokowi said G20 leaders were up until “midnight” discussing the paragraph on Ukraine.\n\nThai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meet at APEC on November 18, 2022 in Bangkok, Thailand. Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images\n\n“There was a lot of pressure that came after the G20 reached consensus on their communique,” Matt Murray, the US senior official for APEC said in an interview with CNN after the summit’s close, adding the US had been consistent during lower-level meetings “all year long” on the need to address the war in the forum, given its impact on trade and food security.\n\n“In each and every instance where we didn’t get consensus earlier, it was because Russia blocked the statement,” he said. Meanwhile, “economies in the middle” were concerned about the invasion, but not sure it should be part of the agenda, according to Murray, who said statements released this week at APEC were the result of more than 100 hours of talks, in person and online.\n\nNations in the groupings have various geo-strategic and economic relationships with Russia, which impact their stances. But another concern some Asian nations may have is whether measures to censure Russia are part of an American push to weaken Moscow, according former Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon, speaking to CNN in the days ahead of the summit.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-Russian official who turned on Putin predicts his next moves 02:44 - Source: CNN\n\n“Countries are saying we don’t want to just be a pawn in this game to be used to weaken another power,” said Suphamongkhon, an advisory board member of the RAND Corporation Center for Asia Pacific Policy. Instead framing censure of Russia around its “violation of international law and war crimes that may have been committed” would hit on aspects of the situation that “everyone rejects here,” he said.\n\nRejection of Russia along those lines may also send a message to China, which itself has flouted an international ruling refuting its territorial claims in the South China Sea and has vowed to “reunify” with the self-governing democracy of Taiwan, which it’s never controlled, by force if necessary.\n\nWhile efforts this week may have upped pressure on Putin, the Russian leader has experience with such dynamics: prior to Putin’s expulsion over his annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014, the Group of Seven (G7) bloc was the Group of Eight – and it remains to be seen whether the international expressions will have an impact.\n\nBut without Putin in the fold, leaders stressed this week, suffering will go on – and there will be a hole in the international system.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-meeting-g20-bali/index.html", "title": "'I'm not looking for conflict': Biden discusses three-hour meeting with ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their first in-person encounter since Biden took office and an opportunity that both sides appeared to hope would lead to an improvement in rapidly deteriorating relations.\n\nEmerging afterward, Biden told reporters he was “open and candid” with Xi about the range of matters where Beijing and Washington disagree. He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.\n\nStill, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.\n\n“I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.”\n\nBiden entered Monday’s talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world’s most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead “the way he’s always been: direct and straightforward.”\n\n“He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden said. “We’re going to compete vigorously but I’m not looking for conflict.”\n\nIn a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nChina previously halted talks – viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together – as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.\n\nThe White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China’s provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement – that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.\n\n“President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,” a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.\n\nBiden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.\n\nAnd he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China’s interests – particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.\n\n“It’s difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I’m confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”\n\n‘Good to see you’\n\nThe meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi – through a translator – appeared to say, “Good to see you.”\n\n“As leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said as the talks got underway.\n\n“The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,” he said.\n\nSpeaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.\n\n“A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,” Xi said through a translator. “He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThe two leaders’ talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world’s largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.\n\nThe moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other’s company since 2011. Biden has claimed that as vice president, he spent north of 70 hours with Xi and traveled 17,000 miles with him across China and the United States – both exaggerations, but still reflective of a relationship that is now perhaps the most important on the planet.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nChina warns US not to cross ‘red line’ over Taiwan\n\nXi stated that Taiwan is the “first red line” that “must not be crossed” in China-US relations, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.\n\nReferring to the “Taiwan question” as the “very core of China’s core interests” and “the bedrock of the political foundation” of China-US relations, Xi stated that peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and “Taiwan independence” is “as irreconcilable as water and fire.”\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed the self-ruled democracy of 24 million as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it, and has pledged to take it back – by force if necessary.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporters explain one of the most contentious issues of US-China relations (2022) 05:31 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the meeting, Xi stated that basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-US joint communiques – which touches on the Taiwan issue – are the “most important guardrail and safety net” for bilateral relations and are “vitally important” for the two sides to “manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict.”\n\n“We hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques. President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,” according to the readout.\n\nXi also defended China’s human rights records and governance system, saying that China has “Chinese-style democracy” that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become “an obstacle to growing China-US relations.”\n\n“The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,” the readout said.\n\nA meeting long in the making\n\nThe meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.\n\nRelations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nIn a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and wrote the country was the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.”\n\nThere was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan over the summer.\n\n“Every matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,” a senior US administration official said.\n\nPlanning for Monday’s meeting predated Pelosi’s trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing’s furor. The process was “serious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,” the official said.\n\nA second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.\n\n“I won’t say that the conversations weren’t contentious because obviously there’s lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,” the official said. “The dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.”\n\nFor his part, Biden takes meetings like this “incredibly seriously” and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.\n\n“He goes through ‘if this happens, then should we handle it this way,’” the first official said. “He understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it’s his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.”\n\nOfficials said in Monday’s meeting they expected Biden’s senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi’s inner circle.\n\nBiden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum\n\nFor Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi’s reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China’s Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.\n\nEven a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.\n\n“I know I’m coming in stronger, but I don’t need that,” Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.\n\nUS officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific “deliverables,” including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries’ goals and perspectives.\n\n“Xi is not an enigma to President Biden,” a senior administration official told CNN. “He knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.”\n\nChina’s pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing’s intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China – but they believe that is all about to change.\n\n“We can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,” the senior administration said. But, they added: “What that looks like is difficult to know right now.”\n\nSullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office “takes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/politics/trump-kanye-west-nick-fuentes-mar-a-lago/index.html", "title": "Trump hosted Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes alongside Ye a week ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hosted White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago estate this week, demonstrating his continued willingness to associate with figures who have well-publicized antisemitic views as he embarks on another White House run.\n\nWest, who has legally changed his name to Ye, posted a video Thursday on Twitter in which he claimed that Trump “is really impressed with Fuentes,” who has repeatedly made antisemitic and racist comments as chronicled by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nFuentes, West said in the Twitter video, “is actually a loyalist” to Trump, unlike others who he said abandoned the former president after the 2020 election.\n\nIn a text message conversation tweeted by West on Thursday, he and Fuentes said they both met with the former president. A source familiar with the dinner confirmed to CNN that Trump on Tuesday met with Fuentes and West, who became engulfed in controversy after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast in October.\n\nThe source said that Fuentes was a guest of West, who attended the dinner along with Karen Giorno, who ran Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign, and another unidentified man.

Trump said that his advisers don’t like that, and want him reading from the teleprompter.\n\nAt one point during the dinner, Trump declared that he “liked” Fuentes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor calls Trump's dinner with a Holocaust denier and Kanye West 'very troubling' 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nAccording to the source, the dinner grew tense at various times, including after West asked Trump to join his 2024 campaign ticket for president as vice president, which Trump “laughed off.” The source could not pinpoint the exact moment the former president’s mood shifted.\n\nTrump acknowledged the dinner in a post on Truth Social Friday stating: “This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio.

Even a social visit from an antisemite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable.

Fuentes was present on the grounds of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he has promoted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about fraud in the 2020 election.

They were expected to meet with Chinese companies behind closed doors.\n\nThe group entered China without undergoing a mandatory seven-day hotel quarantine standard for most arrivals. Images showed hazmat-clad medical workers greeting Scholz’s jet at Beijing’s Capital International Airport to test the official delegation for Covid-19 upon their arrival.\n\nDuring the Friday morning meeting between the two leaders, Xi called for Germany and China to work together amid a “complex and volatile” international situation, and said the visit would “enhance mutual understanding and trust, deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields and plan for the next phase of Sino-German relations,” according to a readout from state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference with Premier Li, Scholz said that Germany’s economic relationship with China had recently become “more difficult” because Beijing was making access to some of its markets more difficult.\n\n“We are seeing discussions in China tending more towards autonomy and less economic ties. And these views are ones that need discussing,” Scholz said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrives at Beijing Capital International Airport on November 4, 2022. Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nScholz’s visit — the first by a G7 leader to China in roughly three years — comes as Germany slides towards recession. But it has fired up concerns that the interests of Europe’s biggest economy are still too closely tied to those of Beijing.\n\nSince Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine this year, Germany has been forced to ditch its long dependence on Russian energy. Beijing has declared its friendship with Moscow has “no limits,” while China’s relations with the United States are deteriorating.\n\nNow, some in Scholz’s coalition government are growing nervous about Germany’s ties with China.\n\nThe tension was highlighted recently by a fierce debate over a bid by Chinese state shipping giant Cosco to buy a 35% stake in the operator of one of the four terminals at the port of Hamburg. Under pressure from some members of the government, the size of the investment was limited to 24.9%.\n\nThe potential deal has raised concerns in Germany that closer ties with China will leave critical infrastructure exposed to political pressure from Beijing, and disproportionately benefit Chinese companies.\n\nBut Germany is hardly in a position to rock the boat with Beijing as it grapples with the challenge of reviving its struggling economy. Its consumers and companies have borne the brunt of Europe’s energy crisis, and a deep recession is looming.\n\nIf the European Union and Germany were to decouple from China, it would lead to “large GDP losses” for the German economy, Lisandra Flach, director of the ifo Center for International Economics, told CNN Business.\n\nThe Kiel Institute for the World Economy estimates that a major reduction in trade between the European Union and China would shave 1% off of Germany’s GDP.\n\nGermany needs to shore up its export markets as ties with Russia, once its main supplier of natural gas, continue to unravel.\n\nWhen it comes to China, Germany won’t want to “lose also this market, this economic partner,” said Rafal Ulatowski, an assistant professor of political science and international studies at the University of Warsaw.\n\n“They [will] try to keep these relations as long as it’s possible.”\n\nPressure on Berlin\n\nAs Western countries have imposed swingeing economic sanctions on Russia, China has publicly maintained its “neutrality” in the war while ramping up its trade with Moscow.\n\nThat has triggered a backlash in Europe, where some companies are already becoming wary of doing business in China because of its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions.\n\nPressure on Berlin is also mounting over China’s human rights record. In an open letter Wednesday, a coalition of 70 civil rights groups urged Scholz to “rethink” his trip to Beijing.\n\n“The invitation of a German trade delegation to join your visit will be viewed as an indication that Germany is ready to deepen trade and economic links, at the cost of human rights and international law,” they wrote in the memo, published by the World Uyghur Congress. Based in Germany, the organization is run by Uyghurs raising awareness of allegations of genocide in China’s Xinjiang region.\n\nIt suggested Berlin was “loosening economic dependence on one authoritarian power, only to deepen economic dependence on another.”\n\nIn an op-ed published in a German newspaper on Wednesday, Scholz said he would use his visit to “address difficult issues,” including “respect for civil and political liberties and the rights of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.”\n\nA spokesperson for the German government addressed wider criticism last week, saying at a press conference that it had no intention of “decoupling” from its most important trading partner.\n\n“[The chancellor] has basically said again and again that he is not a friend of decoupling, or turning away, from China. But he also says: diversify and minimize risk,” the spokesperson said.\n\nLast year, China was Germany’s biggest trading partner for the sixth year in a row, with the value of trade up over 15% from 2020, according to official statistics Chinese trade with Germany was worth a combined €245 billion ($242 billion) in 2021.\n\nA new flashpoint\n\nStill, the furor surrounding the Hamburg port deal is a reminder of the tradeoffs Germany has to confront if it wants to maintain close ties with such a vital export market and supplier.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamburger Hafen und Logistik (HHLA), the company operating the port terminal, told CNN Business on Thursday that it was still negotiating the deal with Cosco.\n\nFlach, of the ifo Center for International Economics, said the deal warranted scrutiny because “there is no reciprocity: Germany cannot invest in Chinese ports, for instance.”\n\nA container ship from Cosco Shipping moored at the Tollerort Container Terminal owned by HHLA, in the harbor of Hamburg, Germany on Oct. 26. Axel Heimken/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, it is easy to overstate the impact of the potential agreement, said Alexander-Nikolai Sandkamp, assistant professor of economics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\n“We’re not talking about a 25% stake in the Hamburg harbor, or even the operator of the harbor, but a 25% stake in the operator of a terminal,” he told CNN Business.\n\nJürgen Matthes, head of global and regional markets at the German Economic Institute, told CNN Business that critics were no longer simply weighing the business benefits of Chinese investment in the country.\n\n“Politics and economics have to be looked at together and cannot be taken separately any longer,” he said. “When geopolitics comes into play, the view of China has very much declined and become much more negative.”\n\nChina’s recent treatment of Lithuania has also deepened concerns that Beijing “does not hesitate to simply break trade rules,” Matthes added. The small, Eastern European nation claimed last year that Beijing had erected trade barriers in retaliation for its support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has defended its downgrading of relations with Lithuania, saying it is acting in response to the European nation undermining its “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” This year, after a Lithuanian official visited Taiwan, Beijing also announced sanctions against her and vowed to “suspend all forms of exchange” with her ministry.\n\nWhat’s on the table\n\nAs the German delegation touched down on Friday, they were faced with another issue, which has become the single biggest headache for companies across China.\n\n“The biggest challenge for German businesses remains China’s zero-Covid policy,” said Maximilian Butek of the German Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n“The restrictions are suffocating economic growth and heavily impact China’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAn aerial view of the urban landscape in Shanghai on Sept. 25. The city underwent a months-long Covid lockdown earlier this year. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nHe said the broader restrictions were so stifling that some companies had moved their regional headquarters to other locations, such as Singapore. “Managing the whole region without being able to travel freely is almost impossible,” he added.\n\nIn a brief statement, Volkswagen told CNN Business that its CEO was attending the trip since “there have been no direct meetings for almost three years” due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“In view of the completely changed geopolitical and global economic situation, the trip to Beijing offers the opportunity for a personal exchange of views,” the automaker said.\n\nEnd of a golden era?\n\nDespite Beijing’s Covid curbs and geopolitical tensions, Germany has every economic incentive to stay close to China.\n\nIts dependency on China can be seen across industries. While about 12% of total imports came from China last year, the country was responsible for 80% of imported laptops and 70% of mobile phones, Sandkamp said.\n\nThe automobile, chemical and electrical industries are also reliant on Chinese trade.\n\n“If we were to stop trading with China, we would run into trouble,” Sandkamp added.\n\nChina made up 40% of Volkswagen’s worldwide deliveries in the first three quarters of this year, and it’s also the top market for other automakers such as Mercedes.\n\nWariness among some German officials over the country’s closeness with China could filter into a more restrictive trade policy, though economic cooperation is still in both parties’ interests.\n\nIn September, Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck told Reuters that the government was working on a new trade policy with China to reduce dependence on Chinese raw materials, batteries and semiconductors.\n\nUnidentified sources also told the news agency that the ministry was weighing new rules that would make business with China less attractive. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nBut “despite all odds and challenges, China remains unrivaled in terms of market size and market growth opportunities for many German companies,” said Butek, of the German Chamber.\n\nHe predicted that “the large majority will stay committed to the Chinese market and is expecting to expand their business.”\n\nCompanies appear to be toeing that line. Last week, BASF CEO Martin Brudermüller was quoted in Chinese state media as saying that Germans should “step away from China-bashing and look at ourselves a bit self-critically.”\n\n“We benefit from China’s policies of widening market access,” he said at a company event, according to state-run news agency Xinhua, pointing to the construction of a BASF chemical engineering site in southern China.\n\n— CNN’s Simone McCarthy, Chris Stern, Lauren Kent, Nadine Schmidt, Claudia Otto and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Anna Cooban", "Michelle Toh", "Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-swearing-in-intl/index.html", "title": "Benjamin Netanyahu sworn in as leader of Israel's likely most right ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu Thursday completed a dramatic return as Israel’s prime minister, after being sworn in as the leader of what is likely to be the country’s most right-wing government in history.\n\nNetanyahu and his government were sworn in on Thursday for his sixth term as prime minister, 18 months after he was ousted from power.\n\nHe returns with the support of several far-right figures once consigned to the fringes of Israeli politics, after cobbling together a coalition shortly before last week’s deadline.\n\nMembers of Netanyahu’s Likud party will fill some of the most important cabinet positions, including foreign minister, defense minister and justice minister.\n\nBut a number of politicians from the far right of Israel’s political spectrum were set to be appointed to ministerial posts, despite controversy over their positions during the run-up to November’s election, which was won by a Netanyahu-led bloc of ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties.\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, an extremist who has been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, will take on a newly expanded public security role, renamed national security minister, overseeing police in Israel plus some police activity in the occupied West Bank.\n\nBezalel Smotrich, leader of the Religious Zionism party, has been named minister of finance, and has also been given power to appoint the head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), an Israeli military unit which among its duties handles border crossings and permits for Palestinians.\n\nDuring his campaign, Smotrich had proposed a series of drastic legal reforms, seen by many critics as a clear way to undercut judicial independence. This includes dropping the ability to charge a public servant with fraud and breach of trust – a charge Netanyahu faces in his ongoing corruption trial.\n\nNetanyahu has pleaded not guilty and called that trial a “witch hunt” and an “attempted coup,” and has called for changes to Israel’s judiciary system.\n\nAryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party Shas, will serve as interior minister and minister of health.\n\nAs the new ministers were preparing to be sworn in at the Knesset, the country’s parliament, around 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside to protest Netanyahu’s return to office, the Jerusalem Police spokesperson said.\n\nThe rightward shift in the Israeli government has raised eyebrows abroad and at home. On Wednesday, over 100 retired Israeli ambassadors and foreign ministry officials expressed concerns about Israel’s incoming government in a signed letter to Netanyahu.\n\nThe ex-diplomats, including former ambassadors to France, India, and Turkey, expressed “profound concern at the serious damage to Israel’s foreign relations, its international standing and its core interests abroad emanating from what will apparently be the policy of the incoming Government.”\n\nThe letter pointed to “statements made by potential senior office-holders in the Government and the Knesset,” reports of policy changes in the West Bank, and “some possible extreme and discriminatory laws” as a point of concern.\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides congratulated Netanyahu on Thursday, writing on Twitter: “Here’s to the rock solid US-Israel relationship and unbreakable ties.” Nides is married to Virginia Moseley, CNN US Executive Vice President for Editorial.\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson noted Netanyahu has “repeatedly said he will set the policy of his government” as he enters a coalition with far-right parties.\n\n“As we have made clear, we do not support policies that endanger the viability of a two-state solution or contradict our mutual interests and values,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBiden administration officials have largely avoided addressing the ultra-right components of the new Israeli government. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that the US “will engage with and judge our partners in Israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government.”\n\nNetanyahu’s slim November victory came in the fifth Israeli election in less than four years, amid a period of protracted political chaos during which he has remained a dominant figure.\n\nIn his address to the Knesset on Thursday, Netanyahu said that of the three major tasks assigned to his government, the first will be to “thwart Iran’s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.” The second priority would be to develop the country’s infrastructure, including the launching of a bullet train and the third would be to sign more peace agreements with Arab nations “in order to end the Israeli-Arab conflict.”\n\nNetanyahu was already Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, having previously held the post from 2009 to 2021 and before that for one term in the late 1990s.\n\nIsrael also got its first openly gay speaker of parliament on Thursday. Amir Ohana, a former minister of justice and public security, is a member of the Knesset representing Netanyahu’s Likud party.\n\nSome ultra-Orthodox lawmakers who had refused to attend his swearing-in at the Knesset seven years ago were among those who voted for him on Thursday.\n\nAhead of the parliamentary vote on the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid tweeted: “We pass on to you a state in excellent condition. Try not to ruin it, we’ll be right back. The handover files are ready.”\n\nWith additional reporting by Kareem El Damanhoury", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Hadas Gold Amir Tal", "Rob Picheta", "Hadas Gold", "Amir Tal"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/economy/joe-biden-business-labor-leaders-inflation-progress/index.html", "title": "Biden meets with business, labor leaders to highlight inflation progress", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is meeting with business executives and labor leaders to highlight recent progress in combating inflation and steadying the economy, a White House official told CNN.\n\nBiden is sitting down in person and virtually with the top executives of such companies as Ford, Kaiser Permanente and Carrier as well as the presidents of the Service Employees International Union and United Food and Commercial Workers.\n\nThe meeting is designed to call attention to recent economic progress and seek out ideas to bring inflation down further, the official said.\n\nBiden was scheduled to be joined by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and his top economic adviser Brian Deese.\n\n“Thanks to the President’s economic plan, the U.S. economy has created 10 million jobs—including 700,000 manufacturing jobs—since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration,” a White House official said. “We are seeing initial signs that inflation is coming down: the October Consumer Price Index showed moderation in inflation, as did the October Producer Price Index released this week.

Past scandals, their own legal nightmares and treacherous politics aren’t stopping them from recreating that dream of a past glory. Trump would love to plow a similar furrow.\n\nBoth former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva and ex-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have shown that time out of power could be a springboard for unlikely political rebounds.\n\nThis may be a hopeful sign for Trump, who has leveraged the midterm elections next week as a show of his own power within the Republican Party, anointing a crop of nominees who promote his 2020 election fraud falsehoods.\n\nTrump has left no doubt that he’s itching to mount another presidential campaign – not just because he misses the spotlight. He possibly sees a new White House bid as a shield against possible indictment in several criminal probes.\n\n“I will probably have to do it again,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Texas last month, referring to the possibility of his third presidential campaign, which would be rooted in his still-high popularity in the Republican Party but could founder on his far more uncertain standing among a broader general electorate.\n\nAmerican presidents defeated after only one term have generally faded pretty fast into history. Trump would need to emulate a feat achieved only once before, by President Grover Cleveland, who lost the election of 1888 only to return to the White House after exacting revenge on President Benjamin Harrison after his victory four years later.\n\nThe art of the political comeback\n\nIsrael’s Netanyahu, one of Trump’s closest friends on the international stage, would love to get the band back together with Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former prime minister, first elected in 1996 and who has dominated Israeli politics for much of the last quarter century, was on the verge of a stunning second comeback, as initial exit polls suggested he may have won a narrow majority in yet another election in a nation politically split down the middle.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The born survivor who molded modern Israel 04:35 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd on Sunday in Brazil, Lula da Silva, who’s known as “Lula,” narrowly defeated President Jair Bolsonaro in a runoff election. While Trump probably would have preferred the opposite result since Bolsonaro is something of a protégé, the leftist former leader’s win showed that former presidents can have second acts.\n\nLula da Silva, a former two-term president of Brazil, has, like Trump, had his run-ins with legal authorities. In fact, his long and winding road to a political return detoured through a partial jail term for alleged corruption. The Supreme Court’s annulment of his sentences cleared him to run again.\n\nThere had been fears that Bolsonaro would emulate his US alter ego and fellow Covid-19 mask rejectionist by refusing to accept the result of an election that tipped him out of power after only a single term. But while he hasn’t conceded, the man known as “The Trump of the Tropics” says he’ll respect the constitution and hasn’t so far resorted to inciting an insurrection to try to keep his job. But he’s unlikely to go away: He lost the election by the narrowest of margins, his political movement is still strong – and, like Trump, he may be looking to the future.\n\nBolsonaro and Lula da Silva aren’t the only blasts from the past who’ve tried to pave a way back to power. In Italy, three-time former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is back in parliament after a tax fraud scandal, though his attempt to play kingmaker in coalition talks dissolved after he boasted about his ties with old friend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who just happens to be a hero to Trump as well.\n\nLike Lula da Silva and Bolsonaro, Trump enjoys fervent support from loyalist supporters who aren’t dissuaded by their run-ins with the law.\n\nLula da Silva emerged from jail as a hero to his followers, one-and-a-half years into a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering imposed in 2018.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Lula said after narrowly beating Bolsonaro 02:16 - Source: CNN\n\nNetanyahu, however, is still embroiled in his corruption trial and faces one charge of bribery and three charges of fraud and breach of trust in three separate investigations. He has adopted a distinctly Trumpian approach to his plight – slamming the investigations as a “witch hunt” and an “attempted coup” and, like the former US president, has raised doubts about the legitimacy of the judiciary.\n\nAs he travels the world, President Joe Biden has been telling allies that “America is back” or, in other words, that the disruptive Trump administration that alienated allies and saw the American president cozy up to dictators, is over.\n\nYet many foreign diplomats – as they observe the vitriol and division in the United States and Trump’s strength with his base, not to mention the state-level candidates he’s elevated this year who could oversee the 2024 election – wonder how long they can bank on the more traditional, multilateral brand of stable US leadership Biden is trying to restore. Even if Trump doesn’t run in 2024, the power of his movement is so strong in the GOP that a possible future Republican president would likely share his populist, nationalist, “America First” instincts.\n\nThe comeback that failed\n\nStill, the comeback trail is not always kind to populist leaders who have fallen from power. Ex-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just saw his attempt to win back 10 Downing Street foiled after the short, but disastrous premiership of his successor Liz Truss.\n\nJohnson – once referred to as “Britain Trump” by the former US president – last month failed to persuade sufficient Conservative MPs to reelect him as their leader and, therefore under the British system, as prime minister.\n\nThe chaos, scandals and mismanagement of Johnson’s premiership featured partying in Downing Street when the rest of the country was being told to observe strict Covid-19 protocols. Conservative MPs opted instead for former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who has only been in power for a week but is already finding out what many observers believe to be the case – that the Conservative Party is ungovernable.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson, like Trump, isn’t ready to cede the limelight. On Tuesday, he told Sky News that he planned to attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt later this month. He made the announcement after Sunak said he wouldn’t attend owing to the demands of salvaging the British economy. But on Wednesday, the sitting prime minister tweeted that he would indeed go to the conference – amid suggestions he didn’t want to be overshadowed by one of his predecessors.\n\nJohnson, unlike Trump, did not get defeated in a general election. Instead, his colleagues decided he was an electoral liability, which is very different from how the GOP has treated Trump.\n\nJohnson still believes he has a mandate to rule, given the landslide election win he masterminded in December 2019 – and it’s a safe bet he’d be ready to pounce if Sunak founders.\n\nJohnson’s hero is Winston Churchill, the original political comeback kid who endured years in the political wilderness before his country turned to him for leadership in its darkest hour in World War II.\n\nAfter his shock defeat in the 1945 election, the great Briton didn’t go away either: He returned to 10 Downing Street as prime minister six years later.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}

Mark Westmoreland, pastor of Glenn Memorial, in opening remarks told the audience that Tuesday's service \"celebrates 96 years of faith and love,\" and several members of the Carter family read passages of scripture.\n\nChip Carter, the Carters' second eldest son, during the service called his mother his hero and \"the glue that held our family together through the ups and downs.\"\n\n\"She told me that when dad started running for president that the thing that she enjoyed the most were the people that she met across the country,\" Chip Carter said, adding that, as first lady, her faith served as a guideline in her work and conversations with Americans across the country.\n\n\"She and dad were able to make a positive difference in people's lives,\" he said, touting her work fighting stigmas surrounding mental health care, poverty and other critical worldwide issues.\n\nKathryn Cade, Rosalynn Carter's longtime aide and friend, told the audience at the service, \"What a remarkable woman she was a wife, mother, business manager, political strategist, diplomat, advocate and author.\"\n\nAs Cade reflected on Rosalynn Carter's work in the U.S. and around the world, she shared that her \"compassion and empathy for those who are suffering was boundless, her passion for action even more so.\" Cade celebrated Rosalynn Carter's work to eradicate diseases, fight for women's rights and even protect monarch butterflies.\n\nJason Carter said in some ways his grandmother was like a lot of grandmothers, baking with mayonnaise and once making pimento cheese sandwiches for strangers on a flight.\n\nBut he also touted her work with the Carter Center fighting the spread of guinea worm disease around the world, a condition that used to affect millions of people that has now become rare. Jason Carter called Rosalynn Carter's mental health advocacy a \"50-year climb.\"\n\n\"It is remarkable how far she could see and how far she was willing to walk. And that effort changed lives, and it saved lives including in my own family. She was made for these long journeys,\" he said.\n\nPolitical leaders and their spouses joined the 99-year-old former President Jimmy Carter, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden; Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff; and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Benjamin said he feels a connection with the Carters’ humanitarian beliefs.\n\n“I like their empathy, how they carried themselves,” he said. “Their causes were all to help folks, whether it was Habitat for Humanity, whether it was mental health, or just trying to improve the world as a whole. That who the Carters were – and are, because he’s still here.\n\nServices for the former first lady began Monday with a wreath-laying at the Rosalynn Carter Health and Human Sciences Complex at Georgia Southwestern State University, her alma mater. The Carters' four children were all in attendance.\n\n'Your service and sacrifice'\n\nTributes to Rosalynn Carter quickly echoed outside of Georgia this week.\n\n“Your legacy will go on in the lives of those you helped,” a family from Pennsylvania wrote in a condolence book set up in the White House Visitors Center by the White House Historical Association in Washington.\n\nMany of the signers called Carter a role model. They praised her “kindness and grace,” her advocacy for the vulnerable and her “wonderful marriage and relationship with Jimmy.”\n\n“You were an inspiration to a generation of women!” a woman from Florida wrote.\n\nA nurse recalled meeting Carter, who fought stigmas around mental health, when Carter spoke at a convention of psychiatric nurses.\n\n“Thank you for your service and sacrifice,” the nurse wrote.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe and Savannah Kuchar, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2023/11/28/rosalynn-carter-memorial-service-chip-carter-tribute/71730248007/", "title": "Everything Chip Carter, son of Jimmy & Rosalynn, said during tribute ...", "text": "Here is the full transcription of what James Earl \"Chip\" Carter III said about his mother, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, during a memorial service Tuesday in Atlanta at Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church on the campus at Emory University.\n\n\"I want to welcome you all here. Thank you for coming and helping to mourn with my family and mostly to celebrate a life well-lived.\n\n\"My mother was the glue that held our family together through the ups and downs and thicks and thins of our family's politics. As individuals, she believed in us and took care of us.\n\n\"When I was 14, I supported President (Lyndon) Johnson. Every day I wore a Johnson sticker on my shirt, and periodically I would get beat up and my shirt torn and buttons pulled off and my sticker always destroyed. And I would walk the block during lunch from school down to Carter's Warehouse, and my mother would have a shirt in a drawer, already mended, buttons sewn on and the LBJ sticker still applied.\n\n\"Years later she was influential in getting me into rehab for my drug and alcohol addiction. She saved my life.\n\n\"When I started making speeches for dad in his political career, I was so nervous I often vomited in the waiting room before we went on stage. And one day after debating seven other children, offspring of candidates for president, I called my mother and told her how nervous I got. And she told me something that I have used a thousand times since. She said, 'Chip, you can do anything for 20 minutes except hold your breath.'\n\n\"When I was in the second grade at Plains, they had a donkey basketball game in the stadium in the school building there to raise money for the school, and my mother rode her donkey as fast as it would slowly go right under the goal, spun around so she was facing its tail, caught the pass and made the winning two points. She was my hero that night, and she's been my hero ever since.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, mom and I were talking when she said that dad asked her to marry her for the second time, she said yes. But she expected him to provide for her a life of adventure. He told her that it would happen.\n\n\"She told me that she had lived on both coasts in Hawaii when he was in the Navy and began her family. Mom said when it was decided they would leave the Navy and move back to Plains (Georgia) she was upset. That family story is that they rode in the car from Connecticut to Plains, Georgia and when Mom had something to say to Dad, she would say, 'Jack, would you tell your father...\n\n\"When Dad ran for office the first time my mother ended up running Carter's Warehouse — she loved it. Every time he would go on a campaign trip or during the legislative session, she was really pleased to be in the office and be the boss. She told me when dad started running for president, that the thing she enjoyed the most was the people that she met across the country and that from working in Carter's Warehouse she said, 'I was able to speak the languages, prices and yields and related to everyday issues for farm families, especially in Iowa. She said because of that, she's the one that helped win that election there.\n\n\"Then, as first lady of the United States, always trying to follow the teaching of Jesus, and to do what he taught her to do as a guideline, she said, 'You will always get criticized by somebody for everything you do, so you might as well do what's right. She and dad were able to make a positive difference in people's lives and that of so many families too.\n\n\"My parents' 77-year partnership is often talked about. Mom was always well-informed on the issues of the day. In the White House, mom asked dad so many questions that he finally said that she should attend Cabinet meetings. So she did, and caught a lot of flack for that, but she was then able to speak with authority on issues across our country and the world. She would often try, and often fail, to get dad to do what was right politically. When she couldn't change dad's mind she would repeat to herself, 'a leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they need to go.'\n\n\"Losing the election in 1980 was devastating to us all. My parents were still young, my mother only 53, and they knew they still had more to contribute. They decided they would become missionaries and spent months trying to decide how to accomplish their goals. Finally, they decided as partners to start The Carter Center, which would allow my mother to continue to fight the stigma of mental illness and allow them both to help the poorest of the poor on this Earth as Jesus had taught them.\n\n\"Mom started the Rosalynn Carter Institute at Georgia Southwestern State University to train and support those who help others. At the same time mom and dad continued to support Habitat for Humanity ,and mom continued to support the Friendship Force. She told me that her adventures had led her to more than 120 countries. She had been fly fishing all over the world, she had met kings and queens. Presidents, others in authority, powerful corporate leaders and celebrities. She said the people that she met felt the most comfortable with and the people she enjoyed being with the most were those that lived in absolute abject poverty, the ones without adequate housing, without a proper diet and without access. And she had probably had more adventures than anybody on Earth.\n\n\"Mom was always fun to be with. Halloween before the pandemic, Mom showed up at Amy's house. Amy lives on a street which closes down on Halloween and every house is decorated. Mom was beautifully dressed as a monarch butterfly. The Secret Service were dressed casually but perfectly as Secret Service agents. She proceeded to go up and down the street with her great and grandchildren and go trick or treating up and down and talk to people all over the street. She got back to Amy's and was so excited because she'd been out so much and nobody had recognized her.\n\n\"After Dad went was put in hospice and my mother had dementia, my siblings, my wife and I would stay with them so that there would always be a family member around. One day, my mother was sitting with my wife, Becky, and she was reminiscing on what it was like to go to live in Hawaii, and she was talking about learning all the native dances. She got up from the sofa, pushed her walker away, which she couldn't take her step without, and proceeded to do the hula for two or three minutes. She grabbed her walker, turned around, sat back on the sofa, turned to my wife and said, 'That's how you do it.'\n\n\"I will always love my mother. I will cherish how she and dad raised their children. They've given us such a great example of how a couple should relate.\n\n\"Let me finish by saying that my mother, Rosalynn Carter, was the most beautiful woman I've ever met. And pretty to look at, too.\n\n\"Thank you.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/28/jimmy-carter-attend-funeral-for-wife-rosalynn-carter/71726463007/", "title": "Jimmy Carter, former presidents and first ladies to attend Rosalynn ...", "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter is expected to be in Atlanta today to attend the second day of memorial services for his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter.\n\nPolitical leaders and their spouses will join the 99-year-old Carter, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden; Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff; and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

He traveled from Reno, Nevada, to Georgia for the week’s memorial services.Bacon said the sight reminded him of when Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter walked more than a mile down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day 1977 – the start of a tradition that’s been upheld for more than 40 years.\n\nSaying goodbye to a first lady\n\nBetty Moss, 90, said the service was “as wonderful as Rosalynn.”Her husband, Robert Moss, 93, was an agricultural scientist and worked with former President Jimmy Carter in the early 1960s. They stayed friends all through the Carters’ time in the governor’s mansion, in the White House and their decades back in Plains.“We were glad to see him out here for Rosalynn,” Robert Moss said.\n\n'She'll tell you: Don't stop'\n\nPastor Tony Lowden in his eulogy for the former first lady said \"her family, her friends, her neighbors all knew her to be someone who did not think of herself but rather others and others' needs.\"\n\n\"Her care and concern for those around her defined her and left the most remarkable impression upon our hearts and memories, as we remember her today,\" he added.\n\nLowden ended his comments with a call to action for Rosalynn Carter's loved ones to carry on her lifetime of service, saying, \"You have an obligation today to live on her legacy.\"\n\n\"She'll tell you don't stop. There's still too many homeless people in the world. There's too many people that still don't have equal rights. There's still too many people who suffer from mental illness. There's still too many people that look at the color of her skin. She'll tell you don't stop,\" he said.\n\n'She worshipped the lamb'\n\nPastor Tony Lowden began his eulogy for the former first lady by remarking that it seems nobody \"has anything bad to say about Rosalynn Carter.\"\n\n\"Not one word. Not a news article,\" the pastor said. \"Not even one person on the left or anybody on the right.\"\n\n\"I believe the reason why is because she did not worship the donkey or the elephant,\" he added. \"She worshipped the lamb.\"\n\nRosalynn Carter's loved ones wear leis at her funeral\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter wore a red lei at Rosalynn Carter's. Other family members wore them as well as Hawaiian shirts.\n\nBut what's the significance for the Carter family? The Carters spent time in Hawaii when Jimmy Carter was in the Navy. Rosalynn Carter was also photographed wearing carnation leis on prominent days of her husband’s presidential campaign.\n\nA matriarch, a global humanitarian\n\nJosh Carter, the Carters' grandson, spoke on behalf of his father, Jeff Carter, the Carters' youngest son. He called his grandmother \"kind, loving and caring,\" telling the audience at her funeral that she \"was happiest whenever there was a new baby\" in the Carter family.\n\n\"Every time we had a new baby in the family, she could not wait to play with them. And she did play, in the same Carter Center boardroom where my grandparents would host presidents and other world leaders. Mom, in her 80s, would get on the floor and chase babies and play peekaboo,\" Josh Carter said.\n\nBut he also reflected on the moments that moved her as she advocated for critical causes around the world, explaining that she would tell stories \"about a performance that a village had in her honor.\"\n\n\"Or she would tell us about the astounded joy on people's faces when they learned that something as simple as education and a filter cloth would rid the entire village of guinea worm,\" he added.\n\n'Somebody that you could trust'\n\nJack Carter on Wednesday told his mother's loved ones that his parents worked together throughout their lives, saying \"she became a partner in a true sense of the word where they had equal footing.\"\n\nBut he also remembered her independence, sharing that \"She was also good with numbers and thought that it wasn't right to pay the CPA because she was never wrong on the numbers,\" prompting laughter in the audience.\n\nThe son of the former president and first lady also recalled a time when he tried to bake a cake for his family − but accidentally set it on fire.\n\n\"She was also somebody that you could trust when things got out of hand,\" he said of his mother.\n\nNation:Plains, Georgia, remembers former first lady Rosalynn Carter: The 'Steel Magnolia'\n\nWho is speaking during Rosalynn Carter’s funeral?\n\nThe former first lady’s funeral in Plains is set to include tributes from two of the Carters’ sons, Jack Carter and Jeff Carter.\n\nThe memorial will also include scripture readings by three of her great-grandchildren, a eulogy delivered by Pastor Tony Lowden, and music provided by vocalist Joanna Maddox, pianist David Osborne, the Georgia Southwestern State University Concert Choir and the Southwest Civic Chorus.\n\nCarter’s Tuesday service in Atlanta included tributes from Rosalynn Carter’s longtime aide and friend Kathryn Cade, journalist Judy Woodruff, and grandson Jason Carter.\n\nHow to watch, stream Rosalynn Carter's funeral\n\nIf you want to watch the historic former first lady's funeral in her longtime Georgia home, the memorial will be streamed here at 11 a.m.\n\nThe start of a historic love story\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter weren't supposed to go on their first date.\n\nOn a Sunday night in 1945, Jimmy Carter, on a break from the U.S. Naval Academy and in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, was supposed to go out with another woman. But after she was busy at a family reunion, the future president sought out another date – and laid eyes on his future first lady.\n\n“I wanted to have a date because I was getting ready to go back to Annapolis for another time of isolation,” Carter told Oprah Winfrey in an interview in 2015. “I was cruising around Plains and saw Rosalynn on the front steps of the Methodist church.”\n\nThe two went to a movie, and Carter told his mother the next morning that \"she's the one I'm going to marry.\" They were wed July 7, 1946.\n\n'She was unreal'\n\nThree students from Dooly County High School drove forty minutes from Vienna, Georgia, to attend Rosalynn Carter’s funeral service. They’re all members of Future Farmers of America, a youth leadership organization of which Jimmy Carter is longtime member.\n\nKaleb Green, 16, said it’s “a great honor” to be in Plains on “such a historic day.”\n\nThe Carters’ legacy has inspired Green to one day run for president. He said, “If they did it, I can too.”\n\nRoger Teeple, an agriculture teacher for FFA who accompanied the students, praised Rosalynn Carter’s work in nature preservation, especially the habitats she provided for monarch butterflies.\n\n“She was unreal,” he said. “As nice a person as I had ever met.”\n\nMourners begin arriving in Plains\n\nThe rural town of Plains, Ga., pop. 600, was astir early Wednesday with law enforcement, volunteers and news reporters ahead of the funeral and burial service of former first lady Rosalynn Carter.\n\nTraffic cones and metal barriers lined the streets throughout downtown Plains and those leading to the Maranatha Baptist Church, where a service for family and friends is scheduled to start at 11 a.m.\n\nMourners began arriving at the church at about 8:30 a.m. They were picked up from the Plains welcome center by charter buses.\n\nThe farming town’s main roads will be closed ahead of the service and final farewell on Main Street, where people can watch as Rosalynn Carter’s motorcade heads from the church to the Carter Home and Garden, part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.\n\nRosalynn Carter will be laid to rest outside the modest ranch-style home she’s shared with Jimmy Carter since they had it built in 1961.\n\nThe Carters were a fixture at the church since they returned to Plains after leaving the White House in 1981. Jimmy Carter’s Sunday school classes drew visitors from across the country, and Rosalynn Carter, a deacon, who also taught Sunday school, helped start the church’s food drive, which now feeds hundreds of families each month. The former first lady participated in the charity event into her 90s.\n\n'What a remarkable woman she was'\n\nAt Tuesday's service, Rosalynn Carter’s family, friends and colleagues honored her decades-long dedication to global humanitarian work. They celebrated her fight for mental health care and push for women’s rights around the world. The former first lady’s loved ones also highlighted her work via The Carter Center as she advocated for peace efforts, health programs and more.\n\nRosalynn Carter’s longtime aide and friend Kathryn Cade told the audience at the memorial “What a remarkable woman she was: Wife, mother, business manager, political strategist, diplomat, advocate, author. Yet what I remember most about her was her tireless dedication to taking care of others.”\n\nSpeakers also shared personal memories of the former first lady. Jason Carter, the Carters’ grandson, told the audience at the service that his family has recently reflected on a flight they took together.\n\nAs they sat in the plane, Jason Carter said, “my grandmother took out this Tupperware of pimento cheese and this loaf of bread, and she just started making sandwiches.\"\n\n\"She gave it to all of us grandkids everyone else, and then she just started giving them to other people on the plane,\" Carter added. \"And people were sitting there like 'Rosalynn Carter just made me the sandwich, you know?' They couldn't believe it, but she loved people.”\n\n'It's hard when you know them'\n\nIn Plains on Tuesday, residents and guests prepared to welcome the former first lady, humanitarian and activist to her home.\n\nInside the auditorium of Plains High School, where Rosalynn Carter graduated as a valedictorian in 1944, about a dozen people – mostly national park service workers – watched the memorial service for the former first lady. After each speaker, they clapped along with the crowd in Atlanta.\n\nJoan and Dave Vogt on Tuesday watched the tribute service for Rosalynn Carter in the auditorium. They stopped in the Carters’ hometown on their way from Illinois to Sarasota, Florida, for a family vacation. “It felt very intimate,” Joan Vogt said of being in the former first lady’s high school and watching the memorial service. She met Rosalynn Carter once on the campus of Goshen College, a liberal arts college in Indiana. Rosalynn Carter was there campaigning for her husband, who was running for president at the time.\n\nIn another part of Plains, Ramona Kurland explained that she knew the former first lady and former president for about 30 years through the political memorabilia shop she owns with her husband in the Georgia town. While greeting customers, she watched a live stream on her phone of Rosalynn Carter’s memorial service.\n\nShe pointed out each member of the Carter family as they appeared on screen. After a speech from James “Chip” Carter, she wiped her cheek.\n\n“It’s hard when you know them,” she said.\n\nRosalynn Carter remembered through recipes\n\nSince Rosalynn Carter's death earlier this month, Americans across the country have been reflecting on her legacy of advocating for mental health programs, women's rights, disease eradication and more. But some have also recalled more personal moments – including her recipes.\n\nFor example, the The National Archives and Records Administration shared the recipe for a classic strawberry cake in remembrance of Rosalynn Carter, one of her family's favorites.\n\nAll you need are these ingredients:\n\n1 package of yellow/white cake mix\n\n1 3 oz package of strawberry jello\n\n¾ cup of cooking oil\n\n1 cup of chopped nuts\n\n4 eggs\n\n2 tablespoons of flour\n\n1 10 oz package of frozen strawberries/1 pint of fresh strawberries with ½ cup of sugar\n\nAfter you gather all of the ingredients, you must mix all of them together and “beat well.” Only then, can you proceed to throw the mixture into an angel cake food pan to bake at 345 F for 45 minutes or until done.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/11/20/rosalynn-carter-hamas-israel-interstate-10-osama-bin-laden-tiktok-nfl-taylor-swift/71651541007/", "title": "Rosalynn Carter, Israel-Hamas war, Interstate 10, Osama Bin Laden ...", "text": "Tributes to former first lady Rosalynn Carter are pouring in from all over the world, remembering a leader who championed mental health causes for decades.

Unsurprisingly, improved quarterback play is a key component for all of these turnarounds – credit to the Browns' rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson for recording his first NFL victory Sunday – a massive win against the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Wednesday, November 29th, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, mediators work to try and extend a truce in the Israel-Hamas War. Plus, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter was remembered at a service yesterday. And how tribes around the great lakes must fight to protect water resources.\n\n♦\n\n12 more hostages held by Hamas were freed yesterday, 10 Israelis and two Thai nationals. And Israel released an additional 30 Palestinians held in prisons. Hamas is expected to release another 10 hostages today, while Israel is set to release another 30 Palestinians. Militants in Gaza are believed to still hold nearly 160 people captive. About two thirds of the Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails since Friday were being held under administrative detention, meaning they were not told the charges against them or given due legal process, according to an analysis of Israel prison service data by CNN. The other third had been convicted and sentenced. Meanwhile, international mediators continue to work to extend a truce between Israel and Hamas, currently set to expire at the end of the day.\n\n♦\n\nFormer First Lady Rosalynn Carter was remembered yesterday at a tribute service attended by Presidents, her fellow first ladies, and other prominent guests. But it was her faith, dedication to the country, and global humanitarian work that took center stage at the memorial. The service held at a Methodist church on Emory University's campus in Atlanta also featured music from some of the Carter's favorite musicians, including Garth Brooks. Several members of the Carter family spoke about Rosalynn and read passages of scripture. Chip Carter, the Carter's second-oldest son, called his mother the glue that held the family together, and his hero.\n\nChip Carter:\n\nMy mother, Rosalynn Carter, was the most beautiful woman I've ever met, and pretty to look at too.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJason Carter said that in a lot of ways his grandmother was like many grandmothers, baking with mayonnaise and once making pimento cheese sandwiches for strangers on a flight. But he also touted her work with the Carter Center, fighting the spread of Guinea worm disease around the world, a condition that used to affect millions and now has become rare. He also called Rosalynn Carter's advocacy for mental health, a 50-year climb. Political leaders and their spouses joined 99-year-old former President Jimmy Carter at the service, including the Bidens and Clintons. And fellow former First Ladies, Melania Trump, Michelle Obama, and Laura Bush were also in attendance. Rosalynn Carter died earlier this month at the age of 96.\n\n♦\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have reignited the debate over Obamacare ahead of 2024. I spoke with USA TODAY National Political Correspondent, David Jackson, for more. David, thanks for hopping on.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nHey. Thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo, Trump, this past weekend said he's looking into alternatives to so-called Obamacare. What did he say here, David? And what alternatives is he talking about?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nWell, he didn't talk about anything specifically. He was on Truth Social and attached a Wall Street Journal editorial criticizing the President Obama healthcare plan, saying that it was driving up healthcare costs. Trump said he basically agreed with it, that costs are too high. And he said, \"I'm looking at alternatives.\" He didn't specify what those were, but it was evident that he wants to try to put healthcare in play, at least for the Republican primaries.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd how did the Biden campaign counter these comments?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nThey jumped all over it. The reason we wrote about it is because I think these are some of the opening moves of the general election campaign. At least, it's the way the campaigns see it. Biden and his campaign aides just totally jumped on Trump's comment, saying he wants to gut the Obama healthcare bill and deprive millions of people of healthcare and it's going to drive up costs for everybody, and the usual litany of complaints that you hear when people talk about the effects of the Obama healthcare law. And they made it clear that it's something that they plan to use in the general election against Trump, whether he talks about it again or not.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCan you just remind us, what's their background on this issue?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nBiden was obviously a very big proponent of the Obama healthcare law when it was passed in 2010. And signing the law in 2010, you might remember he used the phrase BFD to describe it during the Obama signing ceremony. So he's been a big proponent of it as well. Trump came into office pledging to repeal Obamacare, and he came closer than people remember. He basically came within one vote of the Senate of gutting the law entirely, but Senator John McCain decided at the last minute to stick with the law. So it's still a law of the land.\n\nThere have been problems with the implementation, because it's a heavy set of regulations and it's hard for a lot of people to understand. So there have been tweaks to it by the Biden administration, but they have done nothing really to change the basic effect of the law, which is the guaranteed healthcare coverage for most Americans. And they're very proud of it and they intend to make it an issue in his re-election campaign.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid, it's almost December. We know that Iowa and New Hampshire are coming up right around the corner in January. How do the Biden and Trump camps view the race at this point? Are they expecting to face the other in a rematch general election?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nYes, very much so. The Trump people feel like they have it wrapped up already. They may be mistaken about that, because Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are picking up big endorsements and big money contributions to try to head him off at the pass in Iowa and New Hampshire. But Trump is an overwhelming favorite. He has the huge lead in the polls. Among those who think he's going to win the nomination are the Biden campaign. They're convinced that Trump will be nominated again, and that's going to be the President's opponent in the fall of 2024.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid Jackson, thank you, sir.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAmericans for Prosperity Action, the political network founded by billionaire Charles Koch is endorsing Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary. The move gives the former South Carolina governor a major boost less than 50 days before January's Iowa caucuses. In a memo, the conservative grassroots organization said that Haley offers America the opportunity to win the primary and defeat President Joe Biden next fall. The move comes as Haley has risen above Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as the top Republican behind former President Donald Trump in key national and early primary state polls. The endorsement may signal that some Republicans are beginning to rally around Haley as the Trump Republican alternative for 2024. DeSantis' communications director derided the move as a win for Trump, and that no one has a stronger record of beating the establishment than DeSantis.\n\n♦\n\nTribes in the Great Lakes have protected water resources in the region for generations, but they now must push to be heard. I spoke with Journal Sentinel Great Lakes Reporter, Caitlin Looby, for more. Caitlin, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt.\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo let's just start here. What are tribal treaty rights?\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nSo, treaties are formal agreements between governments, and speaking specifically for Ojibwe tribes here in the Great Lakes. Ojibwe tribes signed a series of treaties with the US government when they were forced to give up their land. This helped create the states that are now known as Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. And a part of these treaties, Ojibwe tribes were granted treaty rights, which have been interpreted to mean the rights to hunt, fish, and gather in the lands that they were forced to give up. But there are lots of different layers when it comes to treaty rights. So, the ability to hunt, fish, and gather can only really happen if the environment is protected. So it's not just about the actual act of casting a fishing line or using a net. That fish has to be able to thrive in the environment that it lives in. And it can only do so if the water that it lives in and the water that flows into wherever it lives is protected and unpolluted.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd so, tribes are fighting a number of legal battles to protect water resources in the Great Lakes region. For starters, they're fighting against oil and mining projects in some cases. Caitlin, what exactly is that issue here, and why do some say the permitting process appears broken?\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nThere's a lot of worry about oil and mining projects further degrading the water that we have here in the Great Lakes. For instance, Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline, which runs from Superior Wisconsin through Michigan to Ontario, has had dozens of oil spills, releasing more than a million gallons of oil into the environment. And when it comes to permitting these projects, Whitney Gravelle, the president of the Bay Mills Indian Community, talked with me about how the burden is often on tribes to tell state and federal agencies how a project may infringe on their treaty rights. But she said it should be the other way around. The burden should fall on companies to prove that their projects won't infringe on treaty rights.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Caitlin, what impact are we seeing climate change have on water in the region and how these indigenous communities use it?\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nClimate change is having impacts on waterways in a lot of different ways. One big problem for Ojibwe tribes, specifically in the Great Lakes, is that climate change is having a large impact on wild rice, or manoomin, which is central to the identity of Ojibwe tribes. Climate change is bringing heavier rain events during a time when wild rice plants are really vulnerable and can be easily uprooted. Warmer winters are also causing birds that feed on wild rice to stick around a lot longer, which can decimate wild rice beds that tribes are trying to restore.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd of course, a lot of what we're talking about is who has the right to use which water. Caitlin, what are the tensions around long-distance needs for water use?\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nIn the Great Lakes region there's a constant worry among folks that water is going to be piped out of the basin to other drought-stricken states. And even though there is a Great Lakes Compact between the eight Great Lakes states that bans this, that worry really never goes away. They also worry about water overuse within the basin.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat's the US government role in all of these fights around water?\n\nCaitlin Looby:\n\nBecause of the signed treaties, the US government has a duty to protect treaty rights. But many sources in our series on indigenous knowledge explained to us that they don't feel like their treaty rights are being upheld. Many of our sources believe that the federal government should speak up on these issues and be more proactive about preventing a lot of these issues before they happen. Something that Whitney Gravelle, the president of the Bay Mills Indian Community told me, is that treaty rights don't just protect the land and water for tribes. Treaty rights are protecting it for everyone, and it's in everyone's best interest that they are maintained.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCaitlin Looby covers the environment for the USA TODAY Network.

What the evidence shows", "text": "John A. Tures\n\nSavannah Morning News\n\nThis commentary is authored by John A. Tures, a professor of political science at LaGrange College\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s polls indicate higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings. So does that mean he’s doomed to lose his reelection bid? To test this, I look at all presidents since Gerald Ford, to see where they were at this point in their presidency. While Biden’s numbers are behind almost every candidate, some presidents looking good at this point lost their election for a second term. Some presidents who looked like bad bets at this stage won another term.\n\nMore:President Joe Biden to travel to Atlanta for Rosalynn Carter funeral service\n\nAccording to Steven Shepard with Politico, “President Joe Biden’s poll numbers keep getting worse. November started with New York Times/Siena College polls showing former President Donald Trump ahead in four of the six swing states.” He’s blamed for his age (though he’s not much older than Trump), and the Middle East conflict (supporters of both sides blame him). Even with reports of strong third-quarter economic growth, one news commentator stated “This probably means more inflation.” In other words, each story seems to be spun against the President, no matter what.\n\nMore:Jimmy Carter, family members arrive at Rosalynn Carter funeral wearing leis. Here's why\n\nThere are no shortages of pollsters, pundits and political scientists who claim they can predict the future this far out from Election Day. But such models don’t exactly have a great record of doing so. It’s like guessing the outcome of the game in the third quarter, third period, or seventh inning of a sporting event, and one team holds only a narrow lead.\n\nAccording to The Economist/YouGov polls, Biden has a 44% approval rating, and a 54% disapproval rating. Rasmussen Reports, no friend to the Democratic Party, has Biden by the same exact score in their latest survey.\n\nIf you look at approval ratings minus disapproval ratings, Biden is eighth of nine presidents, only behind Trump, who had a 39% approval rating and 57% disapproval rating in late 2019. And, of course, Trump didn’t win, which fuels speculation that Biden could meet a similar fate, though he is facing the same man he defeated before.\n\nThe top six presidents in our survey all had presidential approval ratings higher than their disapproval ratings, with five of them sporting a nine-point lead in percentages. But not all of them won reelection, of course.\n\nTake the case of Gerald Ford, who had a 46%-37% lead in approval-to-disapproval ratings at this point in his political career. The man who defeated him, Jimmy Carter, held a 51%-37% advantage in approval-to-disapproval, only to lose as well. Similarly, George H. W. Bush looked like a good bet for reelection, when he had a 52%-39% approval-to-disapproval rating advantage, and also lost.\n\nBill Clinton’s numbers were a tad better than Bush’s at this point, but in January of 1996, he was underwater politically. He still won another term. Barack Obama was seventh in this survey, with a 42%-50% disparity in approval ratings vs. disapproval ratings and was reelected in 2012.\n\nBiden has regained his lead over Trump in the polls, according to Newsweek. But the point is, it’s still way too early in the polls to guarantee a prediction based upon where a candidate stands today in surveys. Nobody should guarantee a Biden victory, nor should they count him out.John A.

A 911 call received at 2:34 a.m. reported a shooting in progress, and officers discovered Takeoff dead on the third level, just outside the front door, police said. The Harris County medical examiner ruled Takeoff died from “penetrating gunshot wounds of head and torso into arm.”\n\nThere were roughly 40 people at the event, many of whom left “possibly out of fear,” Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said.\n\nA man, 23, and woman, 24, also were injured and took private vehicles to the hospital, Sgt. Michael Arrington of the homicide division told reporters Tuesday. He did not elaborate on their injuries but said, “They’re both going to be OK.”\n\nEmployees told police gunfire erupted after the party, when a large group of people gathered outside the front door “and it led to an argument where the shooting took place from the disagreement,” Arrington said.\n\n“A lot of people that were there fled the scene and did not stick around to give a statement,” the sergeant said. “All we can hope is you all will reach out and give us evidence to solve the death of Takeoff.”\n\nInvestigators believe the suspect or suspects, possibly in their 20s, attended the private party, and at least two guns were discharged, Finner said. Police are in the process of tracing shell casings and reviewing surveillance footage, he said.\n\n“Mark my words,” Finner said. “This great city, with our great citizens, with our police department – we will find who’s responsible for it. … We’re going to get them in custody, OK?”\n\n‘What if it was your brother?’\n\nInvestigators face the challenge of an anti-snitch culture that many hip-hop artists have long embraced. Takeoff’s uncle and bandmate, Quavo, appeared on a posthumous 2020 track by Pop Smoke, “Snitching,” which decried “rats” and talking to police. Pop Smoke was fatally shot in Los Angeles months before the track was released.\n\nFinner was clear, however, that investigators do not believe Takeoff was “involved in anything criminal at the time,” he said.\n\n“I got many calls from Houston and outside of Houston, and everyone spoke of what a great young man this is, how peaceful he is, what a great artist (he is),” the chief said. “Based on what people say about him, he’s well respected, nonviolent. I would not expect him to be involved, but I do want to wait on the investigation.”\n\nHe continued, “I ask you one thing and I want this to resonate with everybody: What if it was your brother? What if it was your son? You’d want somebody to step up, so please step up. Get the information to us so we can bring some closure to this family who’s hurting right now.”\n\nFinner cautioned against blaming hip-hop, saying, “Sometimes the hip-hop community gets a bad name,” but he knows and respects many in the community. Like Atlanta, Houston boasts a robust rap scene and claims several stars, including Travis Scott, Megan Thee Stallion, Paul Wall and the prolific producer, DJ Premier.\n\n“There’s so many talented individuals, men and women in that community who again I love and I respect, and we all need to stand together and make sure nobody tears down that industry,” Finner said. “I’m calling to start here … as possibly as early as next week. I want to meet with some of our artists and see how we can taper things down.”\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner also issued a plea: “If you have any information – for those in the hip-hop community, to those who were there last night – please, please provide that information to HPD.”\n\nHe emphasized the shooting spoke to an issue larger than hip-hop and expressed concern that, though murders and violent crime are down in Houston, too many young men of color were killing each other.\n\n“Now, everybody has access to guns,” the mayor said. “In my day, you have a disagreement – fist fight and you deal with it. In this day, if there’s a disagreement, in those few seconds when the emotions are running high, people pull their guns and then they’re shooting – and as a consequence of that, we have too many young men of color that are being injured or fatally killed and their future is cut off and family members and friends are left to mourn. This does not have to be our reality.”\n\nStanding alongside law enforcement, he echoed Finner’s promise that Houston police would find the person or people responsible for the rhymesmith’s slaying.\n\n“We will solve this particular case. We will find the shooter or shooters, but information provided will help to expedite that,” he said.\n\nRap star was on an upward trajectory\n\nThe news of Takeoff’s death was a blow to the hip-hop community, still reeling from the fatal shooting of rapper PnB Rock in September. Rapper Ja Rule tweeted, “this s**t has to STOP,” while Houston’s Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nBorn in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Takeoff began performing with Quavo and another relative, Offset, in 2008, and the trio found success with their 2013 single, “Versace.” Three years later, their track “Bad and Boujee” with Lil Uzi Vert thrust them into the international spotlight.\n\nMigos now have four studio albums, two of which have gone platinum, along with a handful of solo projects and more than a dozen mixtapes. Takeoff’s 2018 solo effort, “The Last Rocket,” hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nTakeoff and Quavo had just recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, Unc & Phew, and their first album, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” dropped last month, with Billboard reporting it had reached No. 1 on the rap charts.\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.”\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”", "authors": ["Eliott C. Mclaughlin Amir Vera", "Eliott C.

Press\n\nASBURY PARK, N.J. -- They're planted on sidewalks, bolted to buildings, but many of them serve no purpose.\n\nAt street corner after street corner, receivers have been ripped off the wire; in one, a stone was jammed into the coin release slot. What vandals aren't destroying, nature is slowly claiming with rust.\n\n\"They're like sculptures, relics. There's one up there but it doesn't work,\" said Gary Brewington, a crossing guard for the Asbury Park school district, pointing to a public payphone on Main Street.\n\nOnce the only way to make a call on the street, payphones are now a casualty of the cellphone era. Brewington estimates there are about seven payphone stanchions on Main Street that don't have working phones.\n\nIn most cases the phones have been removed from the housings and what is left is just shells of their former selves.\n\nAsbury Park is not alone in New Jersey. Go to just about every town at the Jersey Shore. You'll find them next to a liquor store in Manasquan, a bank in Ocean Grove, at a strip mall in Long Branch.\n\nThe question is: Who owns them and are they are ever going to come get them?\n\n\"I have no idea,\" said Brewington.\n\nThese abandoned payphones do have owners, though. There are several independent companies that are operating or operated payphones here: ETS Payphones Incorporated, Integrated Utilities, NewTel Payphone Operations and Pacific Telemangement Services.\n\nETS Payphones however, is out of business and according to a 2006 article in the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the owner of the Georgia-based company was sentenced to 13 years in prison for a $400 million dollar payphone fraud scheme.\n\nThat company has at least one payphone falling apart in the area: in front of a check cashing business in Long Branch. Just who's responsible for that phone now has city officials scratching their heads.\n\n\"That's a good question. I don't know,\" said Howard Woolley, business administrator for the city of Long Branch.\n\nThe state Board of Public Utilities said the onus is on the payphone provider to come get any phone where the service has been cut off. The removal of the phone must be done so that the street, sidewalk, building, or any other structure where the payphone was located is restored to its exact condition prior to the payphone's installation.\n\nMuncipalities can seek assistance from the board for abandoned phones, said BPU spokesperson Rebecca Schwarz\n\nAccording to the American Public Communications Council, Inc., a public communications trade association, independent payphone companies got into the business after the Federal Communications Commission broke up the Bell System monopoly on payphones in 1984.\n\nThen, by the 2000s, when communication companies like AT&T and Verizon were pulling out, those companies began buying up their properties.\n\n\"We have not been in the payphone business for years. I'd say our last property was two years ago.\" said John Bonomo, spokesperson for Verizon. \"We gradually sold them off.\"\n\nBonomo said the reason Verizon got out of payphones is fairly obvious.\n\n\"Society has changed. It's become more reliant or dependent on cellphones,\" he said.\n\nPTS bought up Verizon's New Jersey property in 2011. Mike Zumbo, president of Pacific Telemangement Services, a privately-owned public communications company based in San Leandro, Calif., said they entered the payphone business on the West Coast in 1985. Today they have about 40,000 payphones in 42 states, including 6,500 payphones in New Jersey. More than 300 of them are in the 732 area code.\n\n\"There's still a need for public payphones across the country,\" said Zumbo said. \"A good example would be Hurricane Sandy because Sandy knocked down the cell phone antennas. The landline was the most reliable.\"\n\nPTS has expanded into WiFi communications but Zumbo said they are also the largest payphone provider in the country.\n\n\"Five years ago I thought it might have diminished sooner. But one of the problems not solved is areas where cell phones and WiFi can't access — the payphone remains the simplest mechanism for communications.\"\n\nThere are those like Zumbo that believe payphones still have a use in society.\n\n\"I still think it's a decent public utility. Maybe that's why they have them in public transportation stations,\" said John Kaplow, 60, of Asbury Park. \"They are good for emergencies. There are a lot of people who don't have a lot of (money) and they don't want to pay a monthly cell phone bill.\"\n\nPeople continue to plunk quarters into payphones at hospitals, train stations and airports, convenience stores — places where there is a high volume of foot traffic.\n\n\"A payphone needs to make 100 calls a month, about 3 calls a day to pay for itself,\" said Zumbo.\n\nIf it doesn't, Zumbo said they will ask a municipality, a transportation company or a business to pay a subsidy or they will have to yank the phone. NJ Transit is one of the companies that does pay a subsidy to Zumbo on some of the phones located at their hubs.\n\n\"PTS has a monthly revenue threshold for each payphone and if it is not met they will remove the phone unless we pay a monthly fee to keep it. They have kept some on our property per our request, for our customers' convenience and for access to 911 services,\" said William Smith, a public transit spokesman.\n\nBut they have also had some abandoned phones as well, like the one at a New Jersey Transit Train Station in Long Branch, transit spokespeople have said.\n\n\"The phone stanchion in question has been inactive for quite some time and we are requesting that PTS remove it,\" said Smith.\n\nZumba said the company's practice is to remove inactive phones. \"We usually come get the whole system. We're not 100 percent perfect, there are cases where we may have missed one,\" he said.\n\nPayphone properties peaked in 2000 when there were about 2 million payphones. Zumbo believes there are only about 100,000 payphones now, closer to the 1902 level.\n\n\"Payphones will continue to last for a little while longer,\" said Zumbo. \"They'll continue to dwindle but there is still a need.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/10/purge-voter-rolls-mississippi/6712673002/", "title": "GOP-led Mississippi Senate OKs faster purge of voter rolls", "text": "Emily Wagster Pettus\n\nAssociated Press\n\nJACKSON, Miss. — A sharply divided Mississippi Senate voted Wednesday to speed up the process of purging inactive voters' names from election rolls.\n\nThe bill passed 36-16, with all the support coming from Republicans and all the opposition from Democrats.\n\nThe bill says local election commissioners would send a postcard to registered voters who do not cast a ballot in any local, state or federal election during a two-year period that includes two federal elections — a presidential election and a midterm congressional election.\n\nIf voters fail to confirm their address within four years of receiving the postcard, or if they fail to vote during that time, the county would remove their name from the rolls.\n\nVoters’ names could not be removed within 90 days of an election, and the county would have to maintain records for at least two years showing a purged name.\n\nSenate Election Committee Chairman Jeff Tate, a Republican from Meridian, said removing a name under this proposal would take six to eight years.\n\nUnder current Mississippi law, county election commissioners may remove a name if a voter has died, moved away, been judged mentally incompetent or been convicted of a disenfranchising crime.\n\nLegislators pushing for the change say outdated voter rolls make it difficult for courts to find enough people for jury service.\n\n“The rationale is to clean our voter rolls, to make sure that we maintain good voter rolls,” Tate said during the Senate debate.\n\nWhat lawmakers said:Mississippi Senate rejects proposals to expand Medicaid\n\nDemocrats opposing the bill said it would hurt people who choose not to vote for whatever reason — maybe they just don't like the candidates running for many years — but suddenly are motivated to vote because they find a candidate who appeals to them.\n\n“For tens of thousands of people in Mississippi, eligible voters who haven't done a thing in the world except choose not to vote in every single election and didn't get a postcard, or whatever the thing is, they are going to be denied their right to vote by the tens of thousands, and you know it,” said Democratic Sen. Hob Bryan of Amory. \"You know for certain that will happen.\"\n\nCritics also say the proposals would endanger constitutional rights in a state where some older Black residents still remember facing violence or economic repercussions for registering to vote decades ago.\n\nMississippi has about 1.9 million registered voters, and about 1.3 million voted in November.\n\nA similar proposal is awaiting consideration in the House.\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has said he supports the bills, which are based on an Ohio law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling in 2018.\n\nIn a news release Tuesday, the minority leader of the Ohio House, Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes of Akron, urged Mississippi legislators to reject the “use it or lose it” model of purging voting rolls.\n\n“Ohio activists and lawmakers have fought this voter purge battle for years. It has disenfranchised and removed millions of still-eligible Ohio voters from participating in our democracy,\" Sykes said. \"I hope the Mississippi legislature does not follow this path of voter destruction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/10/19/voter-registration-purged-what-to-know/3694110001/", "title": "Has your voter registration been purged? What to know", "text": "In New York, 1.2 million voters are currently listed the inactive voting list, leaving their ability to vote on Nov. 3 in question.\n\nIn neighboring New Jersey, 430,000 are deemed inactive, meaning they either hadn't voted in recent presidential elections or their status as a registered voter is uncertain.\n\nMeanwhile in Pennsylvania, almost 376,000 voter registrations were canceled last year, more than 380,000 were canceled in 2018 and more than 479,000 were canceled in 2017.\n\nSo voters who might have not have gone to the polls in recent years and show up to vote on Election Day might be in for a surprise: Their vote may not count.\n\nVoter purging can disenfranchise voters, particularly targeting communities of color, and can suppress totals across the nation, experts said.\n\n\"The whole concept is backwards. It’s about discouraging people from voting,\" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause/NY, which has sued and won to reform the purging of voters in New York.\n\nIt's a situation playing out in states, and in courtrooms, across the country.\n\nVoters can be purged from voting rolls, or, even worse, removed erroneously, leaving them and poll workers confused on Election Day.\n\n\"Voter purges are an often-flawed process of cleaning up voter rolls by deleting names from registration lists,\" a 2018 report by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice said.\n\n\"Done badly, they can prevent eligible people from casting a ballot that counts.\"\n\nVoters might be registered to vote, but that doesn't give them a lifetime license to vote.\n\nAnd in an election year filled with controversy over ensuring all votes are counted, purging of the rolls is an ongoing issue.\n\n\"It is an attempt to make it harder to vote. All of the onus in our country is on the voter,\" Lerner said.\n\nGeorgia removed 300,000 registrations last year. Wisconsin had a court battle over whether it must strip 200,000 names.\n\nAcross the nation, states canceled 17.3 million registrations between the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterms, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nMore:How safe are your election ballots? Here's what you need to know\n\nHow you could be purged from voting\n\nMany states make voters inactive if they do not vote in two consecutive presidential elections, in addition to taking them off the rolls if they move or die.\n\nIn other words, if a voter went to the polls in the 2008 elections, but hasn't voted since, they could show up and be off the active rolls, which would require them to fill out an affidavit ballot and hope the state approves it.\n\nBut it is an imperfect process.\n\nSince 2013, Florida, New York, North Carolina and Virginia have conducted illegal purges, the Brennan Center found. The report said between 2014 and 2016, states removed almost 16 million voters from the rolls — which was 4 million more than were removed between 2006 and 2008.\n\nThe problems are pronounced and have led to reforms.\n\nIn 2017, after Common Cause sued, the New York City Board of Elections admitted in a legal settlement that it illegally removed the names of more than 200,000 people a year earlier.\n\nIn January, the New York Board of Elections lost a lawsuit brought by Common Cause. A federal judge found the state violated federal election law by making some voters as inactive and removing them from poll books on Election Day.\n\nSo it left inactive voters with no recourse, in many cases, or left poll workers uncertain what to do. In some cases, voters simply were turned away, Lerner said.\n\nNow, New York needs to keep inactive voters on the poll books during elections. Then they would have to fill out an affidavit ballot.\n\n“Tens of thousands of New York voters who appear at the polling place are going to be able to find their names on a list that they wouldn't have been able to find had this decision not been issued,” John Powers, an attorneys for one of the plaintiffs, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the WNYC/Gothamist after the ruling.\n\nMore:How your voter registration can expire in Pa. — and how to make sure you can vote Nov. 3\n\nMore:Voting rights: Texas voter purge is latest effort to target minority voters, activists say\n\nWhy states purge voters\n\nMany states will start the process of purging voters if election boards check on their status by sending out postcards to their home addresses.\n\nIf the postcards are not returned and after two federal general election cycles, they are taken off the rolls pursuant to the National Voter Registration Act of 1994.\n\nAs for deaths or if people move to another states, election boards get death notice information and remove them, and if they get notified someone moved. The same process applies to felons or those deemed incompetent by the courts\n\nMost counties do purges at the beginning of the year after the previous November’s general election and again following primaries.\n\nIn Delaware, voters rolls are purged every non-election year prior to June 1, according to Elections Commissioner Anthony Albence.\n\nThe state’s purging process is largely based on federal law, such as mail not returned from a voter’s address, indicating that they no longer live there.\n\nSome states will send a follow-up piece of verification mail, and if the voter does not respond to it in 60 days, they’ll be listed as “inactive.”\n\nDelaware is also part of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a consortium of 31 states that shares voter registration and motor vehicle information with the goal of improving accuracy of the voter rolls.\n\nIt also expedites the purging process, Albence said: “It’s really helped us over the years.\"\n\nIn Maryland, election officials will only remove a voter without further notice if the voter signs off on having his or her registration canceled or if the state receives notice that the voter has died.\n\nA voter can be moved to inactive status if he or she moves and does not respond to follow up mail from election officials.\n\n\"A voter's failure to vote does not move them to the inactive list or result in their registration being canceled,\" the Maryland Board of Elections said in a statement.\n\nMore:What voters across the Northeast are saying about the presidential election\n\nMore:'We're being silenced,' Smith Island residents say Maryland took away their voting rights\n\nWhat happens if you show up and deemed 'inactive'?\n\nAn inactive voter also can still vote in Maryland. The names of inactive voters still appear in the state's electronic poll book, though the election judge will ask inactive voters to confirm their address.\n\nVoter registrations are canceled in Pennsylvania every year because it's the law. The state and counties are bound by the National Voter Registration Act and state election code to clean up their voting rolls.\n\nWhile the date to register to vote in many states have passed, Pennsylvania's deadline is Monday.\n\nVoting rights groups said the U.S. should move to a model like Canada: every person when they reach age 18 is registered to vote. And states should not remove inactive voters from the rolls, they said.\n\n\"We would like permanent or automatic registration, but that's not the way state law works,\" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania.\n\nSeventeen states, including Maryland, also has same-day voter registration, which means eligible voters can register and vote during early voting or on Election Day, so long as they bring proof of residence.\n\nIn New Jersey, mail from election officials – say, a sample ballot -- must be returned to sender to be classified as inactive. If the voter then misses two federal elections in a row, like other states, they are removed from the voter rolls.\n\nThe extra, mail-related step helps protect against disenfranchising votes, but still more reforms are needed, said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey.\n\n“While keeping our rolls clean and updated is absolutely necessary, aggressive and flawed processes lead to eligible voters being purged without notice or remedy,” Burns said.\n\nMore:Learn before you vote: Delaware Online General Election Voters Guide\n\nMore:2020 election: What to know about mail-in voting in Delaware\n\nIncludes reporting by USA TODAY.\n\nJoseph Spector is the New York state editor for the USA TODAY Network.

But when a voter's registration is \"canceled,\" that person might have to vote by a provisional ballot and wait for a county board of elections to decide if the vote is valid.\n\nMore:In Gettysburg, Biden invokes Lincoln in call to heal the American soul\n\nThe registration deadline is Oct. 19 this year in Pennsylvania. Voters can check their status by going to this state website: https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx\n\nIn addition to the almost 376,000 voter registrations canceled last year, more than 380,000 were canceled in 2018 and more than 479,000 were canceled in 2017.\n\nMore than 100,000 canceled registrations each year can be attributed to a voter's death or change of address.\n\nBut last year, more than 126,000 voter registrations were canceled because those voters did not respond to a mailing from their respective counties, asking if they are still at that address. In 2018, more than 105,000 were canceled because they did not respond to the mailing. And in 2017, nearly 232,000 were canceled because they did not respond to the mailing.\n\nIt's unclear how many of them have re-registered or could be turned away at the polls this year.\n\nIt's also unclear how many canceled registrations belonged to Democrats, Republicans and other party affiliations. The Department of State has not immediately responded to questions about that.\n\nWhy do voters get canceled in Pa.?\n\nVoter registrations are canceled in Pennsylvania every year because it's the law. The state and counties are bound by the National Voter Registration Act and state election code to clean up their voting rolls.\n\n\"We would like permanent or automatic registration, but that's not the way state law works,\" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a nonpartisan voting watchdog group.\n\nBut while there's something to be said for automatic registration, Pennsylvania's voter list maintenance is not entirely unreasonable, she said.\n\n\"People move, people die. We need accurate poll books,\" Almeida said. \"It's easier on poll workers.\"\n\nBut Almeida said she's less concerned about voters being turned away because of canceled registrations and more concerned about voter confusion this year.\n\n\"Pennsylvanians need to check their voter status, make a plan to vote, check on their polling places if they're voting in person or know the rules if they're voting by mail,\" she said. \"We wish there was less of a burden on the voter, but we need to take affirmative steps to not see disenfranchisement on Election Day.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nPennsylvania law mandates that county election offices perform voter registration list maintenance at least once a year.\n\nThe Department of State, which has no authority to remove voters from the rolls, monitors county compliance, said department spokesperson Ellen Lyon.\n\nIt's really up to Pennsylvania's 67 counties.\n\nThe counties must mail notices to voters who may have moved, using information provided by the U.S. Postal Service through its National Change of Address program, she said.\n\nMore:Purple haze Pa.: Why the Keystone State is always a presidential battleground\n\nAdditionally, Pennsylvania is a member of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a consortium of 30 states and the District of Columbia. This allows Pennsylvania to cross-check its voter registration records with those of the other member states, Lyon said.\n\nCounties must mail five-year notices to voters who have not voted or not appeared to vote in the previous five years before taking them off the rolls. They also send an additional notice after two federal election cycles are missed.\n\nThe counties use the responses to its mailings to update the voter registration rolls. If the mailing is returned confirming the voter’s information, the county updates its records accordingly. If the mailing is not returned or if it is returned as undeliverable, the county places the voter on inactive status for eventual removal, Lyon said.\n\nUnder federal and state law, no voter registration may be canceled unless:\n\nThe voter affirmatively requests that his or her registration be canceled.\n\nThe voter registration commission has proper proof the voter has died.\n\nThe five-year notice has been sent and the voter does not vote or otherwise communicate with county election officials through two general elections (even-numbered years).\n\nWhy it matters\n\nPennsylvania has been described as a tipping-point state, the most important battleground with 20 electoral votes up for grabs in a hotly contested general election.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump won Pennsylvania by a little more than 44,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point.\n\nThe president has already said during multiple campaign stops in the state that he will only lose Pennsylvania if the election is rigged, and his campaign has multiple lawsuits against the state in opposition to mail-in voting.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has also raised concerns, saying his biggest fear is that Trump will try to steal the election.\n\nWith concerns and claims from both parties, along with the new addition of mail-in voting, Pennsylvania is under intense scrutiny. And the tight 2016 race showed that every vote counts.\n\nCampaigns and advocates alike say they don't want to see voters turned away at the polls because of an inactive or canceled status.\n\nMichael Anderson, elections director in Lebanon County, where an 80 percent turnout is expected, said he doesn't want to see that either.\n\n\"Even if they are not registered, they can vote here,\" he said. \"If they present as voters, we have to issue a ballot.\"\n\nMore:Trump men vs. Biden women: Which voting group in Pa. will pick the next president?\n\nBut if they are not on the voter rolls, a provisional ballot will be issued.

Class D driver’s licenses made up 5,100 of those transactions; an addition 2,800 were for IDs.\n\nAs a percentage of the 551,911 active or inactive voters in the counties last year, the totals would represent less than one-half of one percent of the voting population.\n\nThe percentages were somewhat higher in the 12 Black Belt counties that will lose examiners. The offices in those counties issued 2,702 licenses and IDs, representing 2.1 percent of the 128,788 voters in those counties.\n\nFew people have applied for voter identification cards in the counties, an alternative suggested by state officials. Over the last two years, the counties issued voter ID cards to 2,177 people, with 1,546 of those issued in the Black Belt counties. Both state officials and legislators say that’s a sign most people are using driver’s licenses to vote. In all, Alabama has issued 6,736 voter identification cards since the start of 2014, in a state with just under 3 million active and inactive voters.\n\nALEA said budget and personnel shortfalls triggered the moves, and acknowledged last week that the withdrawals would only save the agency about $100,000.\n\nBut Black Belt legislators said the issue highlights their concerns about the state’s voter identification law, passed in 2012 and went into effect in 2014. Supporters, including Gov. Robert Bentley, say it guarantees the “integrity” of the political process. Critics, noting few examples of voter fraud, call it a solution in search of a problem.\n\n“One person affected is enough,” said Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro. “Whether it’s one hundred or a thousand, we’re under a system of one man, one vote. If one person has a problem with casting a vote because of a lack of voter ID, that’s a problem.”\n\nControversy\n\nALEA’s moves triggered criticism nationwide. Former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the closings hearkened back to the segregation era. Rev. Jesse Jackson came to Alabama and met with Bentley, Secretary of State John Merrill and members of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus over the closings. The governor said he would work with the Legislative Black Caucus to address the issue.\n\nU.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, asked U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate the closings last week, citing concerns about ballot access and travel for those affected.\n\n“The harsh reality is that many residents affected by this decision will find it hard to travel given limited modes of transportation, and the lack of broadband and home computers in the rural areas makes online access very difficult,” Sewell’s letter said.\n\nThe examiners worked part-time in what ALEA said were county-run offices that the agency did not own. The offices mainly handled new licenses and driver’s license tests. Drivers can renew existing licenses in county offices.\n\nALEA data shows the affected offices performed 33,056 transactions in 2014, ranging from the issuance of licenses and learner’s permits to driver’s tests. About 10,000 of those took place in the affected Black Belt counties.\n\nALEA Secretary Spencer Collier said in a statement last week that the moves “don’t come close to solving the budget issues.” But the secretary called it a necessary redeployment of limited staff.\n\n“ALEA has 103 vacancies in the Driver License Division, (and) we simply do not have the personnel to staff the locations,” the statement said. “We need additional funding from the Alabama Legislature to staff the 31 satellite locations.”\n\nThe Legislature cut ALEA’s budget from $55 million to $44.6 million. Collier and members of the Legislature have clashed over an increase in driver’s license fees, approved earlier this year and worth about $12 million. Legislators said those fees all but remove the cut. Collier said the increase aimed to reduce losses on license manufacturing.\n\nAnna Morris, a spokeswoman for ALEA, said Friday the examiners traveled from central offices to the part-time locations, having to load and deploy equipment each time. The examiners spent a few hours each day before loading up again and moving to another location. With the lack of staff, she said, the traveling examiners cut down on the number of people able to provide services in the district offices.\n\n“This is solely about personnel,” she said. “To fully staff 75 driver’s license locations in the state, you’ll need 255 employees.”\n\nALEA will request a $1.2 million supplemental appropriation in next year’s budget, Collier said. Morris said the money would go toward hiring examiners.\n\nWhere that money would come from is uncertain. The Alabama Legislature cut many state agencies, including ALEA, in the 2016 General Fund budget. Both chambers resisted new tax and revenue measures that might have allowed state agencies to maintain 2015 funding.\n\nHouse Ways and Means General Fund chairman Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, said Friday “there are a lot of concerns” with the office issue, but said “the funding issue is the same with all state agencies.”\n\n“If ALEA or anyone else gets additional funding, it will have to come from somebody else,” he said.\n\nALEA has lost about 114 employees this year, and Morris said they plan to make up the shortfall with hiring freezes and suspension of vehicle purchases, the latter of which was more or less required under the budget approved by the Legislature last month.\n\nConcerns about voter ID laws\n\nState officials have also argued that anyone affected could go to Boards of Registrars to get voter identification cards.\n\nAlabama has issued just under 7,000 voter ID cards in the last two years, and county registrars reached last week said there has been few problems with the process.\n\nBut experts and officials have said in the past hundreds of thousands of voters could face problems obtaining identification. The Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning policy institute at New York University, estimated in 2012 that about 213,000 Alabamians lacked access to a vehicle, with 57,000 of those living more than 10 miles from a place where they could get voter ID.\n\nThen-Secretary of State John Bennett told the Associated Press in 2014 that about 500,000 voters lacked either a driver’s license or a non-driver identification card. He estimated 250,000 of those had one form of ID or the other.\n\nMerrill, the current secretary of state, said in an interview Thursday he had asked legislators to work with his office to run voter registration drives in their districts. The secretary also said the office could print as many voter identification cards as were necessary.\n\n“You also are going to reach a point where you’re not going to need them, because people who didn’t have photo ID have them now, and aren’t going to need another one,” he said.\n\nStill, some legislators are uneasy. Sen. Billy Beasley, D-Clayton, whose district will see three offices close, said the state should be working to improve ballot access, especially for older rural voters.\n\n“A lot of the folks that are elderly have never had a driver’s license,” he said. “Many of those Alabamians have never had access to driving an automobile.”\n\nCounty registrars said to this point, they haven’t seen a lot of demand for voter identification cards, though they agreed the need came from older voters.\n\n“Sometimes we get elderly people who come in that do not have a driver’s license, or a picture ID with government picture on it,” said Bob Pearson, a registrar in Macon County, which has issued 182 voter ID cards in the past two years. “People who come in from other states whose driver’s license might have expired, they ask to get voter ID.”\n\nSingleton, a longtime opponent of the voter ID law, said if the state was going to make driver’s licenses a part of the voter identification package, it should do everything it can to ensure people can get them.\n\nThe senator also said driver’s licenses were often critical for people in obtaining jobs, housing or public benefits.\n\n“You are taking away a piece of the law that you passed,” he said. “The driver’s license can do so much more for me than the voter ID can.”\n\nBy the numbers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/09/22/investigation-ohio-voter-purge-rolls-a-mess/90347416/", "title": "How many were removed from Ohio's voter rolls? It's a mess", "text": "Jessie Balmert\n\njbalmert@enquirer.com\n\nCOLUMBUS - Ohio has a controversial practice of removing voters from the rolls who have not cast ballots in years. But just how many are deleted remains a mystery, raising questions about the care taken with the swing-state’s voter rolls.\n\nThe practice itself has attracted scrutiny – a federal appeals court ruled against it Friday, although the state may appeal. But the way officials delete and track voter registrations raises other concerns.\n\nDepending on where you live, county election officials might diligently remove thousands of voter registrations each year, documented by detailed records. Or they might insist they haven't followed through with the state-ordered process in some years, or apologize for tossing those files years ago, according to an Enquirer / USA Today Network investigation, in which Ohio reporters contacted all 88 county board of elections.\n\nQ&A: Were you removed from Ohio's voter rolls?\n\nWhile nearly every county was happy to discuss what local officials call the \"voter purge\" process, the records they provided were a morass of half-kept data and confusing spikes in removed voters. And the numbers they sent to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission weren't much better.\n\nAt best, these records reveal a lack of care by some election officials tracking voters taken off the rolls.\n\nAt worst, they point to a system of removing voters that's far from uniform – meaning where you live could determine when, or if, your voter registration is deleted. And that could affect whose votes count, and whose don’t, in a critical battleground state that may determine the next president.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, insists counties are removing voters from the rolls in a uniform manner across all 88 counties.\n\n“Everyone is being removed by the same standard statewide,\" Husted said. \"There is not a variance between county to county.”\n\nBut he doesn't have a number for how many people were removed either. Husted doesn’t know whether that figure has increased or decreased over the 20-plus years the state has removed voters this way. His office does compile how many warning notices are sent to people who might be removed: more than 4.6 million notice since 2011. Some of those people are taken off the rolls if they don’t respond to the notice or vote in the following four years.\n\nIn Ohio, county officials run the show. They are tasked with removing voters who haven’t voted in six years or have failed to respond to notices that they might be kicked off. Surely they would track how many people were removed from the rolls in this controversial way.\n\nIt depends. Some county election officials kept detailed records on how many people were removed. Others were pretty sure it had been years since they removed people for not voting.\n\n“You probably get a little different story wherever you go,” Sandusky County Board of Elections Director Barb Tuckerman said.\n\n'A little different story'\n\nFor example, five counties told the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which tracks compliance with voting laws, they hadn't removed any inactive voters between the 2012 presidential election and 2014 midterm election. During that time, Lucas County, which has more than 430,000 residents, reported removing only three voters for failing to vote frequently enough, according to the commission's 2014 report.\n\nAsked about some of these these discrepancies, Husted’s office tracked down several explanations: Henry, Highland and Shelby counties each didn’t have a code in their computers to identify voters they had removed for inactivity. Paulding County officials simply didn’t enter the data correctly. These errors were later fixed, Husted's spokesman said, but they remain inaccurate on the federal report.\n\nIn Lucas County, an employee started to remove voters but never finished. That employee was later fired, and voters were removed from the rolls the following year, after getting an extra chance to vote. Husted also removed three Lucas County Board of Elections members in June 2014 for a \"culture of dysfunction,\" according to a Toledo Blade report.\n\nAre you still registered to vote? A court fight might decide\n\nFranklin County didn't remove voters from the rolls until after the 2015 election, while most other counties removed them before November. Just like in Lucas County, that gave people in the Columbus area another opportunity to vote and register than residents elsewhere.\n\nIn Wyandot County, Board of Elections Director Deb Passet says she hasn't removed people from the list of registered voters in years. But the county told the federal Election Assistance Commission it had purged several hundred people.\n\nWhich is the truth? It's not clear.\n\nPasset has lived in the county for 62 years, knows many of the residents and wants people such as her older aunt to be able to vote this year even after years of abstaining.\n\n\"I just don’t take people off. They aren’t hurting anything being on there,\" Passet said. And the small county office has more pressing concerns, such as printing ballots for the fall election, than removing voters, she said. \"They could be on 'inactive' for 20 years before we get around to it.\"\n\nTuckerman, director of the Board of Elections in Sandusky County, said she hasn't been able to remove thousands of voters who have died or haven't voted in several years from her computer system. And she disagrees with the concept of removing people who haven’t voted in recent elections.\n\n\"I don’t think you should be eliminating people because they haven’t voted. I can understand when you’ve voted or when you are dead, but those are easy to account for,\" she said.\n\nWell, pretty easy to account for. Election officials in Sandusky County did accidentally remove a man from the voter rolls because they thought he had died – twice. Two of the man's sons, who shared his first, middle and last name, died before their father. Election officials assumed the older man had died in both cases so they removed him from the rolls. The mistakes were corrected both times.\n\nIt’s nearly impossible to tell whether Husted is removing voters any differently than his predecessors, both Democrats and Republicans, because several counties have not kept records from before 2011.\n\n“Unfortunately I recently cleaned out a file cabinet that had all the previous reports and the file that I had them in (along with several other files) have come up missing,” Van Wert Board of Elections Director Linda Stutz wrote apologetically in an email, which included the parenthetical.\n\nOhio doesn't need extra voting, court says\n\nStuart Naifeh, one of several attorneys suing Ohio over the way it removes voters from the rolls, said he found similar discrepancies. Some counties were not removing voters from the rolls or removing them at a different time. At least one county used a different, more clear, warning notice. The counties more likely to have problems? Smaller, rural ones, with more Republican voters, he said.\n\n\"The effect has a partisan impact, but I don’t think that’s the motive,\" Naifeh said.\n\nWith all this confusion, why not turn voter removal over to the state, which could keep uniform data and eliminate potential discrepancies over when voters are removed?\n\n“The law is a bottom-up process,” Husted said. “That’s how Ohio law works.”\n\n‘I believed I was registered'\n\nEven if the program is being implemented uniformly, as Husted insists, at least two liberal groups say it's illegal. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and liberal think tank Demos sued Husted's office, saying Ohio officials broke federal law by removing voters simply for not voting frequently enough. If people died, moved or were sitting in prison from a felony conviction, then take them off the rolls. But people who don't vote enough? They shouldn't be kicked off, the groups said – as were tens of thousands of Ohio voters who last voted in 2008, the year President Barack Obama was first elected.\n\nOn Friday, a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, overturning an earlier U.S. District Court ruling. Ohio, the appeals court said, shouldn't have removed voters such as Chad McCullough, who lives in Madison Township in Butler County.\n\nMcCullough voted for the first time in 2008, when he was in his 30s. He votes only when there's an election or a topic that interests him, so he didn't vote again until 2015. McCullough had failed to respond to a warning notice about his voting inactivity. On Election Day, he was informed he wasn't registered to vote.\n\nWait, are you really registered to vote? Mailer gives voters scare\n\n\"I believed I was registered to vote in this election. I had no idea that my voter registration could be canceled, even if I did not move,\" he wrote in court records.\n\nHe cast a provisional ballot, but it wasn't counted because he wasn't registered to vote. That's not unusual. People cannot vote without being registered, so casting a provisional ballot – if you've been removed after six years – does little beyond re-registering you to vote, Husted said.\n\nThe state typically appeals such rulings, so this case appears likely to continue. Husted says he fears the court will force him to put deceased people and those who have moved out of state back onto Ohio's voter rolls.\n\nWith the current system, voters have ample opportunities to preserve their active registration before they are removed, Husted maintains. They could vote in any election, sign a petition for a ballot initiative, respond to that initial warning notice, respond to a request for an absentee ballot, say \"yes\" when a Bureau of Motor Vehicles employee asks them to register to vote, or fill out a new form at their local board of elections. This year, Husted even sent notices to people who weren't registered to remind them.\n\n“We do everything under the sun to try to reach them,\" agreed Carol Lovas, director of the Board of Elections in Ashtabula County. “We will try to reach out to every single voter over and over.”\n\nUSA Today Network reporters Keith BieryGolick, Becky Brooks, Adrian Burns, Mark Caudill, Courtney Day, Maria DeVito, Jeremy Fugleberg, Dan Horn, Spenser Hickey, Hayden Kull, Ben Lanka, Barrett Lawlis, Linda Martz, Spencer Remoquillo, Deirdre Shesgreen, Chrissie Thompson and Michael Throne contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/12/12/arlington-high-back-news-security-officers-suspension/20331109/", "title": "Arlington High dilemma: When is school discipline too harsh?", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nWhen Arlington High School was taken over by a charter school company two years ago, the new educators immediately began bringing order to the hallways.\n\nOn its first day, the takeover company brought in extra security and several dozen off-duty and retired police officers to patrol the halls and campus. By year's end, more student suspensions were handed out — 568 — than there were kids enrolled in the school: 518. Those disciplinary actions, which included multiple suspensions for some students, were more than any other school in the city.\n\nQuestions about the nature of discipline at Arlington have been revived this week, after an unidentified student claimed his nose was broken after an encounter last month with a school security officer.\n\nThe Marion County Sheriff's Office is conducting an internal investigation since the officer in question, William Benjamin, is a reserve sheriff's deputy. He has been placed on administrative leave by the department. He remains employed, but inactive, with the school. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nBenjamin, a former pro football player with an imposing physical presence, in some ways embodied the no-nonsense approach that's been at work since Arlington was taken over by the charter school company, now known at Tindley Accelerated Schools. But he may also symbolize the question from community members that the school: In its efforts to keep order, does the school sometimes goes too far?\n\nThe school's use of suspensions — not just for violence or drugs but, also, for offenses like disrespecting teachers and too much tardiness — has some convinced that Arlington is too quick to remove students.\n\n\"When you put them out of school, you send them on a track to drop out of school. You send them on a track for the school-to-prison pipeline,\" said Carol Craig, education spokesperson for the Greater Indianapolis NAACP Branch. \"What do children do when they are out of school? That's a chance for misbehavior with the criminal justice system.\"\n\nCraig and others have been trying for more than two years to convince Arlington and its parent charter-school organization, Tindley Accelerated Schools, to reduce the number of out-of-school suspensions and expulsions. They've also gone to the mayor's office, which oversees the city's charter schools, and the state board of education seeking help.\n\nAll to no avail, they say. While saying that they support strong discipline, Arlington's critics point to research that indicates that school suspensions are not the best way to help a troubled student. They suggest that detention, Saturday schools and other methods are a better fit.\n\n\"I think that, at this point, there seems to be an overzealous amount of discipline from administrators and teachers of our children, especially there at Arlington,\" said Elizabeth Gore, education chairperson with the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, made up primarily of clergy from predominantly black churches.\n\nArlington's student body is 99 percent black. And the concern about excessive school discipline — especially for black males — isn't a new phenomenon, or just a local concern.\n\nThe American Association of School Psychologists has noted that black male students are disproportionately referred to special education programs and inordinately suspended and expelled. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights says black students are suspended and expelled at rates three times higher than white students.\n\nThe issue was noted this fall in \"Your Life Matters,\" a report commissioned by Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, where recommendations included minimizing out-of-school suspensions and looking for alternatives to punishments that remove kids from school. That same report documented that Arlington had more out-of-school suspensions than similar schools.\n\nMarcus Robinson, the chancellor and CEO of Tindley Accelerated Schools, said he understands the seriousness of what the national research says. He doesn't discount the problem, nationally speaking, of black students being disproportionately suspended or expelled.\n\nBut at Arlington, Robinson said the disproportionate discipline argument doesn't apply because almost all the students are black. Instead, he suggests that the school is doing what is needed to maintain a good learning environment for the students who show up to learn and who don't cause problems.\n\n\"We expect kids to go to class, pay attention, not be a disruption and not use pejorative language. And we hold kids accountable,\" Robinson said.\n\nBefore Tindley, then known as EdPower arrived, Arlington was a school where there were as many as seven fights in a single day, many of them gang-related, Robinson said. During that first year after the takeover, there were no fights among boys at the high school level. And the calm has prevailed since.\n\n\"Most of our discipline,\" Robinson said, \"is set around the idea of making it safe enough to go to school.\"\n\nAs for the incident last month, Robinson declined to speak in detail, other than to say the account he's heard of the incident is different than what the student is saying.\n\nArlington doesn't have an in-school suspension alternative because it can't afford it, Robinson said. And while Arlington's suspension numbers are high, Robinson said that was also true in the days the school was run by Indianapolis Public Schools. Back then, he said, hundreds of children each year were expelled, sent to alternative schools or detained in in-school suspension programs that offered no real instruction.\n\n\"I'm not convinced that Arlington is in a categorically different place than it was before we took over,\" Robinson said.\n\nThat's true in another way, too. While calm now prevails in the hallways, Arlington remains on the state's list of failing schools, where it had been the six years prior to the state's takeover and before Tindley took over.\n\nRobinson has made the case that the state's takeover formula is the cause — that an exodus of students, including some who chafe at the strict environment — has reduced the state money needed to right the ship. And, next year, it's likely that Tindley will abandon its effort at Arlington and the school could return to the IPS' fold.\n\nCraig, with the NAACP, said that will be good for the students because IPS isn't as quick to expel or suspend. But she said next year is still a long time away.\n\n\"I have confidence that IPS next year will move on a different path,\" Craig said. \"What we're worried about is those children are still in the school from now to June under this excessive punitive policy that flies in the opposition to what the Justice Department has recommended for schools.\"\n\nRobert King covers community crime issues.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry.

The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Consumers who have to discard products covered by this recall may contact General Mills Consumer Relations at 1-800-230-8103.\n\nGeneral Mills did not have information about how much flour was involved in the recall. “Food safety is our top priority, and we are voluntarily recalling these specific lots of Gold Medal Unbleached and Bleached All Purpose Flour,” General Mills spokesperson Mollie Wulff said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nWhat else is under recall?Check out USA TODAY's searchable recall database; cars, food, consumer good and more\n\nWhy should I not eat raw cookie dough?\n\nFlour is a raw food and has not been treated to kill germs, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and salmonella, which can cause food poisoning, the CDC advises. Most who get sick from salmonella develop symptoms as soon as six hours and as long as six days after infection. Patients may develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. More severe cases may include aches, headaches, elevated fever, lethargy, rashes, blood in the urine or stool and in some instances may become fatal.\n\nThe CDC estimates Salmonella cause about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year.\n\nSalmonella is killed by heat when flour is baked, fried or otherwise cooked, General Mills notes in details about the recall on its website. When done cooking, properly clean and sanitize your hands, utensils and all surfaces.\n\n“We are continuing to educate consumers that flour is not a ‘ready to eat’ ingredient,\" Wulff said. \"Anything made with flour must be cooked or baked before eating.”\n\nMore coverage from USA TODAY\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/business/unilever-shampoo-recall/index.html", "title": "Dove, Nexxus and other dry shampoos recalled for cancer-causing ...", "text": "1.

It is spread when someone unknowingly ingests the virus – even in microscopic amounts – through eating contaminated foods or drinks or through close personal contact with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis A symptoms of can last up to two months and include fatigue, nausea, stomach pain and jaundice. While most do not have a long-lasting illness, it can also be prevented with a hepatitis A vaccination, the CDC says.\n\nHow can berries get contaminated with hepatitis A?\n\nThe investigation into Willamette Valley Fruit's berries is ongoing, and no cause has been pinpointed for the potential contamination, but the virus is generally transferred to berries in two ways, according to Ellen Shumaker, Ph.D., director of outreach for Safe Plates at North Carolina State University.\n\n\"Hepatitis A is spread through the fecal to oral route, which means that if a harvest worker who has hepatitis A is handling berries without washing their hands first, the virus is likely going to contaminate the berries,\" Shumaker said.\n\nThe other, more likely cause is contaminated irrigation water, Shumaker said. The irrigation water contaminated with human feces is sprayed onto the berries and then preserved when frozen, which makes matters worse.\n\n\"The act of freezing then also helps the virus to remain on the berries,\" Shumaker said. \"Because frozen berries are often eaten without being cooked, there is no step that is removing the virus from the berries, leading to people getting sick.\"\n\nWhat frozen berry products are recalled?\n\nProducts were distributed via the following retailers:\n\nWalmart: Great Value Sliced Strawberries, Great Value Mixed Fruit, and Great Value Antioxidant Blend distributed to select Walmart stores in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming from Jan. 24, 2023, to June 8.\n\nGreat Value Sliced Strawberries, Great Value Mixed Fruit, and Great Value Antioxidant Blend distributed to select Walmart stores in Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Wyoming from Jan. 24, 2023, to June 8.

Why?", "text": "Hundreds of complaints and one federal investigation later, Samsung refrigerators remain the appliances consumers most commonly report to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, alleging problems ranging from defective icemakers to inconsistent temperatures.\n\nMost complaints against Samsung refrigerators in the agency’s database so far this year involve consumers who said they got sick because their Samsung refrigerators don’t keep food, medication, breast milk or other perishables cold enough. Many cite faulty temperature sensors and complain that ice builds up inside the back of the refrigerator. Consumers say the buildup blocks air vents and disrupts the cooling process, causing temperatures to rise.\n\nNearly 700 refrigerator incidents across all brands were reported in 2022, the highest number of annual complaints against any appliance type since the data became available in 2011, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of the data. Of those reports, about 70% involved Samsung products.\n\nThough all refrigerator complaints declined dramatically for 2023 – to fewer than 300 through mid-September – Samsung accounts for the same proportion of the overall refrigerator reports.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission has taken no public action on the Samsung refrigerator complaints, which consumer protection experts say points to key shortcomings in the agency’s ability to quickly inform the public about potentially hazardous products. Red tape and regulatory hurdles delay product recalls or warnings even as consumer complaints pile up, leaving unsafe products to remain available for months or even years.\n\n“It’s beyond comprehension that an agency that has the words ‘consumer’ and ‘product safety’ in its name isn’t actually able to do everything that it can to protect consumers from dangerous products,” said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation published last November found the number of complaints against Samsung refrigerators rose to record levels starting in 2020. An official warning or recall has not been issued, but the same problems appear in 2023 complaints: temperature fluctuations, food spoilage and subsequent stomach ailments, and extra money spent on repairs or new refrigerators.\n\n“This has been a systemic, ongoing problem that Samsung is well aware of but continues to ignore,” wrote one consumer from Ladera Ranch, California, in August, complaining that their French-door refrigerator displayed temperatures 20 degrees lower than the actual.\n\n“It's shocking and a disservice to the community that a recall has not been announced.”\n\nRead more Samsung refrigerator complaints and find your own model\n\nIf you do not see a data search tool below, click here.\n\nSamsung says its refrigerators don’t have any underlying issues.\n\n“As the number-one selling brand of major appliances in the U.S., we stand behind the quality, reliability, and performance of our refrigerators,” Samsung said in a written statement. “Our award-winning commitment to customer satisfaction has remained consistent, and these trends from recent years do not accurately reflect the true quality and reliability of our home appliance products.”\n\nThe written statement noted that the number of refrigerator reports mentioning Samsung “has dropped significantly this year, with a nearly 40% year-over-year decline through September” and said that \"we have investigated each of these reports and value every customer’s experience.”\n\nHowever, the drop in complaints against Samsung refrigerators coincides with a 52% reduction in the number of all refrigerator reports submitted to the safety commission.\n\nSamsung continues to eclipse competing brands in complaints, USA TODAY found. Samsung sold 23% of all refrigerators in the last year, more than any competitor, according to market research firm TraQline, compared to its 70% share of faulty refrigerator complaints.\n\n“How many senior citizens who lose hundreds of dollars’ worth of medication in their refrigerators— How many of those cases are okay?” Murray said. “How many cases of kids ending up in the emergency room with food poisoning are okay?”\n\nA federal class-action lawsuit, filed against Samsung last May in New Jersey, alleges the company knew the refrigerators failed to maintain safe temperatures before they were sold. After surviving Samsung's motion to dismiss, the legal action continues. Plaintiffs’ attorneys did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.\n\nLast November, the CPSC confirmed it was investigating Samsung refrigerators when it denied reporters’ request for records and correspondence about these products over the past decade, citing statutory restrictions on what the agency can publicly say about Samsung refrigerators or complaints about other brands.\n\nThe law restricts the agency from releasing any information, during an investigation or otherwise, that identifies a manufacturer unless certain conditions are met. The commission continues to cite restrictions on what it can publicly say about Samsung.\n\n“We are aware of the reported issue but, due to statutory restrictions on CPSC’s ability to disclose information about specific manufacturers or products, we have no further comment at this time,” Patty Davis, the commission’s press secretary, said this week.\n\nWhy do product recalls take so long?\n\nNotwithstanding the volume of reported issues, a section in the Consumer Product Safety Act restricts the CPSC from swiftly warning the public about an unsafe product even when the agency knows there’s a problem and is looking into it.\n\nThe agency can issue a product warning in as few as 20 days. But the law gives companies the right to challenge the agency’s decision in court, so it's common for a recall or warning to be held up in months of negotiations aimed at avoiding litigation. Meanwhile, potentially unsafe products remain on the shelves, and unaware consumers continue to use them in their homes.\n\nNo other federal health or safety agency is bound by such a restriction. Understaffed and underfunded, the CPSC oversees more than 15,000 types of consumer products and does not have enough resources to speed up investigations and negotiations, consumer protection experts say. When a 20-day window turns into a 20-month delay, the law intended to protect companies against defamation winds up impeding the timely release of safety information.\n\n“Every single syllable of a recall notice is negotiated,” Murray said. “So, the CPSC will not come out and say this, that and the other thing without making sure that it doesn’t hurt the feelings of the company that’s involved. There’s a line between disparaging a company irresponsibly and alerting the public.”\n\nWhen manufacturers won’t agree to a recall, the CPSC can sue them, which may bring them to the negotiating table, said Pamela Gilbert, who served as the agency’s executive director from 1995 to 2001. While the law allows the commission to issue its own warning about a dangerous product before a recall, in practice, it’s rare for the agency to call out a company or product by name unless there’s an imminent hazard or urgent public safety threat.\n\n“Issuing information that doesn’t specifically name manufacturers is almost meaningless,” said Gilbert, who now practices consumer protection law. “Like, ‘There are toasters out there that can set your house on fire.’ Well, what toaster, right? It’s just not helpful unless you can specify what product, who manufactured the product, what it’s called.”\n\nThe agency issues about 300 recalls a year, but even when a product is recalled, consumers don’t always find out about it. While the big, name-brand cases are more likely to get media attention, hundreds of others escape notice. Signs may or may not be posted in retail stores, and if the product was purchased online, the company might not always inform consumers.\n\n“What we are advocating for is for the manufacturers to take more responsibility,” said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. \"The bottom line is these companies, whoever they are, whether they’re selling clothes or makeup or food or the latest gadget, they spend bazillions of dollars to market this stuff to us. Then when there’s a problem with the product, it’s crickets.”\n\nHow long should refrigerators last?\n\nWhile a defective $20 toaster is more likely to get tossed, many consumers persevere in fixing or getting to the bottom of their refrigerators’ issues. Products that people tend to keep in their homes for many years, also tend to rise higher on the CPSC’s priority list, Murray said.\n\nSearch our updated appliance complaints database\n\nIf you do not see a data search tool below, click here.\n\n\"A refrigerator, you know, depending on the model, can cost hundreds or thousands,” Murray said. “People aren’t just going to be like, “Okay, well, I can’t get this problem resolved in one day. I’m going to throw it away. I’ll put it on the curb and call the city to come and get it and be done with it.’”\n\nRefrigerators last an average of 12 years, according to an Energy Saver report from the U.S. Department of Energy. About half of the Samsung refrigerator complaints submitted from 2020 onward involved models that should still have plenty of lifespan, those manufactured between 2014 and 2018, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of the data.\n\nAfter calls to customer service go nowhere or visits from technicians don’t rectify the problem, consumers often take to social media to seek advice or voice frustration. That’s what more than 100,000 users did when they joined a Facebook group called “Samsung Refrigerator Recall U.S.A NOW,” which was taken down by the social media site last year for sharing the contact information of a big-box retailer’s CEO.\n\nThe forum’s removal was a loss to consumers attempting to troubleshoot their refrigerators’ issues and find out if they’re alone, said Tom O’Shea, one of the Facebook group’s administrators.\n\n“The problem with this is everybody thinks it’s just theirs,” O’Shea said. “And once they realize it’s not just theirs, that’s when it explodes. Then it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, mine does that. Oh, my God, my mother’s does that, and my brother’s does that.’”\n\nSeveral new Facebook groups dedicated to faulty Samsung refrigerators and appliances have since popped up, including one called “UNnamed Broken Appliance Group.” The group was renamed to stay off Facebook’s radar, said O’Shea, who continues to help manage the forum.\n\n“The bigger message for the group is it’s not just this,” O’Shea said, referring to Samsung refrigerators. “You can use these tools for any company you deal with. It's the process. Use the Better Business Bureau. Use your consumer protection laws.\"\n\nThere is also a lesson to be learned for companies whose reputations among consumers are at stake, said Pamela Gilbert, a former executive director of the commission.\n\n“For consumer-facing companies, I always think that at the end of the day, they lose when they fight so hard against, you know, what really looks clearly a problem,” Gilbert said. “The companies that win out, I think, are the ones that embrace it and say, ‘Oops, we didn't mean to do that. We made a mistake.’ Reputation for consumer product manufacturers is the No. 1 thing for them.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/us/millennials-turning-40-shoichet-cec/index.html", "title": "Millennials like me turned 40 this year. And everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game. Its game tokens included emojis and a hashtag. Courtesy Hasbro\n\n“It’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one,” he says, “which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years.”\n\nNot to mention that millennials have faced a far bleaker financial picture than older generations, Kimbrough says.\n\n“It’s really hard to think about getting married, having kids, moving out with roommates, and making any of these transitions with the housing market like we have now,” Kimbrough says.\n\nMy husband and I are trying not to be too overwhelmed by this daunting reality.\n\nWe’re visiting open houses on most weekends and planning to meet with mortgage brokers soon.\n\nBy this time next year, we hope we’ll be living in a home that we own.\n\nMyth 4: We don’t take our jobs seriously and don’t stay in them very long\n\nJason Dorsey tells me he often asks a question when he’s invited to visit companies and speak with their employees: “How many of you are millennials?”\n\nGenerally, he says, just a few hands timidly go up.\n\n“They’re expecting it to be negative, because that’s unfortunately what we’ve been framed as for the last 15 years,” Dorsey says.\n\nThat’s around when Dorsey says he saw anti-millennial hype intensifying. Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting. And as this year so painfully reminded me, we never know how much time we’ll have with the ones we love.\n\nWith all this uncertainty, there is one thing I know: My daughter and I are so lucky to be together right now, sharing an evening in a bookstore – something I did with my parents, and something I’d always dreamed of doing if I ever had a child of my own.\n\nAs I watch her toddle down the aisles of the store, I feel so proud of how happy and curious she seems to be.\n\nHer generation doesn’t even have a name yet – or at least not one we know will stick. No matter what we call them someday, I can’t wait to see what they do.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Now several influencers, who say they were sickened, say the company’s lackluster handling of the crisis is putting new responsibility on the influencer community to warn the public.\n\nIt’s also exposing the swift fallout that can emerge when you aggrieve a demographic with such a wide internet reach.\n\n“This company was built on the backs of influencers,” said Cory Silverstein, who runs an organic skincare brand with his wife, and told CNN Business he received the product, called French Lentil and Leek Crumbles, as part of a PR package in mid-May.\n\n“That is what built them up to be like a billion-dollar valuation company, is all these influencers who did the marketing for them,” he added. “At this point, it’s the influencers who are alerting the public that you might end up in the hospital if you eat this product.”\n\nAfter consuming the product, Silverstein said, “I’ve never experienced pain like that — it’s the first time I felt kind of helpless.”\n\nIn response to CNN Business’ multiple requests for comment, Daily Harvest sent the latest update the company posted on their website related to the voluntary recall.\n\n“We want to make sure you have the latest update on our voluntary recall of French Lentil + Leek Crumbles. We are taking this very seriously and doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Your health and well-being are our top priority,” the blog post states, adding that it has reached out to impacted customers and is taking a number of steps to investigate the cause.\n\n“We are working with a group of experts to help us get to the bottom of this—that includes microbiologists, toxin and pathogen experts as well as allergists,” the statement from Daily Harvest adds. “All pathogen and toxicology results have come back negative so far, but we’re continuing to do extensive testing and will keep you updated.”\n\nAn image of Daily Harvest's French Lentil + Leek Crumbles meal from their website. Daily Harvest issued a voluntary recall Sunday of a lentil-based product, after receiving customer reports of gastrointestinal issues linked to its French Lentil + Leek Crumbles meal.\n\nIn an updated blog post Thursday evening, the company said it has received approximately 470 reports of illness or adverse reaction, and the investigation into the root cause remains ongoing. It added that some 28,000 units of the recalled product were distributed in the US between April 28 to June 17.\n\nOn June 17, the company first emailed people who received the product warning that “a small number of customers have reported gastrointestinal discomfort” after consuming the crumbles and urging those who still had them to throw them away. It first posted a statement warning the public not to consume the crumbles on June 19.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Daily Harvest’s emergence as a household name was linked in large part to its aggressive social media campaigns. The company has received multiple celebrity supporters, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Serena Williams (representatives for Paltrow and Williams did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment).\n\nThe meal kit company announced last November that it had secured Series D funding that valued Daily Harvest at over $1 billion.\n\nInfluencers track down a united source for mysterious symptoms\n\nSilverstein said he spent time in an urgent care center where doctors scrambled to figure out what was wrong. He tested negative for all forms of hepatitis, the initial suspect, and did a slew of blood tests that eventually indicated liver enzyme levels that were off the charts. He says that levels of important liver enzymes were elevated as much as twelve times the normal range.\n\nHe spent weeks not knowing the cause of the mysterious illness, until he said his wife saw a post from fellow influencer Luke Wesley Pearson, a content creator from Portland. Pearson was reporting shockingly similar symptoms, he said, and the two realized they had both received these crumbles from the company before they were launched on the public market.\n\nPearson told CNN Business that he underwent emergency surgery on June 12 to get his gallbladder removed after experiencing gastrointestinal issues after consuming the crumbles.\n\nVarious frozen healthy meal items (but not the crumbles that are part of the recall) are visible inside a Daily Harvest frozen meal kit box, Lafayette, California, October 14, 2021. (Photo by Gado/Getty Images) Gado/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nPearson says he tried the lentil crumbles twice, both times leading to intense stomach aches. It was the second try, however, that sent him to the ER. After symptoms that included “excruciating” stomach pains, fever, chills, itching of the hands and feet, and jaundice, Pearson underwent testing that revealed – just like Silverstein – elevated liver enzymes, as well as high bilirubin. Doctors ultimately decided to remove Pearson’s gallbladder.\n\nFor Pearson, it was only after seeing a viral TikTok by Abby Silverman that he realized the issues could be connected to the food he ingested immediately before his issues began. Silverman, a creative director in New York, posted a video that has garnered more than 100,000 likes on TikTok detailing her own experience after eating the Daily Harvest product. She said the lentils similarly landed her in the ER, twice, with alarmingly high liver enzyme levels. While she suspected it may be from the crumbles, she said she formally connected her medical crisis with the lentils after an email from Daily Harvest on June 19 recalling the food item led her to a Reddit thread of scores of other people detailing similar symptoms. Silverman’s lawyer, Mark Apostolos, confirmed to CNN Business in a statement that medical records document her illness and symptoms.\n\n“It’s interesting because I have seen a lot of people on social media over the years try Daily Harvest, which is why I said yes to the PR package,” Silverman told CNN Business.\n\n“This whole health situation has just caused so much anxiety,” said Silverman, who has retained a lawyer, Apostolos, to deal with the fallout. “Obviously, I didn’t expect this. I made the video that I did because I feel like they weren’t doing enough to make people aware of what was going on – I figured people probably still had this in their freezer.”\n\n“We are investigating and evaluating all legal remedies for Abby, who was stricken with illness after consuming this product that was mailed to her,” said Apostolos in a statement.\n\nAnother customer who had her gallbladder removed was Candice Smith, who told CNN Business she initially thought she was having a heart attack after consuming the product. “It was the worst night of my life,” said Smith, the CEO of French Press Public Relations in Raleigh, of the night she rushed to the hospital – where she says she stayed for four days undergoing tests on her enlarged liver and elevated liver enzymes. Her gallbladder was removed on June 19.\n\nThe company declined to comment on claims that customers underwent gallbladder surgeries related to its product. All of the people who spoke to CNN Business said doctors were initially puzzled by their symptoms.\n\nSmith said she had no relevant pre-existing medical conditions before the hospital visit. “I try to be healthy. I eat plant-based, I’m trying to do all the right things,” said Smith. “What am I doing here? Why am I even here? Why am I experiencing this level of pain in my life?”\n\nCompany’s response slammed as insensitive\n\nCaroline Sweet, a freelance actor and writer in Los Angeles, said she was in the emergency room emerging from a CT scan after enduring days of being “completely doubled-over in pain” when she received an email on June 17 from Daily Harvest informing her to throw away the crumbles and offering her a $10 store credit. (The company said in a blogpost all consumers were issued a credit for the recalled product).\n\n“It was just like a huge f**k you,” Sweet said of the email. “The fact that they’re just handling it so poorly feels like such a huge slap in the face.”\n\nSarah Schacht, a consultant and property manager in Seattle, said she similarly became “violently ill” after consuming the product that she said she was initially drawn to for its organic and health-forward marketing. “Everyone who’s on the internet has been served Daily Harvest ads, right?” she said.\n\nSchacht has been vocal on Twitter about urging people to take samples to local health departments or their Food and Drug Administration offices.\n\nSilverstein, meanwhile, said he was incredibly dismayed by the Instagram post Daily Harvest used to alert customers of the recall. The post, which was published on June 19, simply used a previous promotional picture of the crumble – and directed people to click a link for an “important message,” which directed them to a blog post about the voluntary recall. At a first glance, Silverstein said most people would assume that the post was promoting the product.

The ban would also apply to any state park or forest, county or municipal park or beach.

But you still can't smoke ...", "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN —\n\nThailand on Thursday became the first country in Asia to decriminalize cannabis – but tough penalties will still apply to those who use the drug to get high, according to the minister who spearheaded the change.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in an interview ahead of the move, Thai Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he expected legal cannabis production to boost the economy but cautioned that recreational use of the drug remains illegal.\n\n“It’s a no,” said Anutin, who is also a deputy prime minister. “We still have regulations under the law that control the consumption, smoking or use of cannabis products in non-productive ways.”\n\nUnder decriminalization, it is no longer a crime to grow and trade marijuana and hemp products, or use parts of the plant to treat illnesses. Cafes and restaurants can also serve cannabis-infused food and drinks – but only if the products contain less than 0.2% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant’s main psychoactive compound.\n\nHarsh penalties remain in place under the Public Health Act, including up to three months in jail and an $800 fine for smoking cannabis in public.\n\n“We [have always] emphasized using cannabis extractions and raw materials for medical purposes and for health,” Anutin said. “There has never once been a moment that we would think about advocating people to use cannabis in terms of recreation – or use it in a way that it could irritate others.”\n\nIn particular, the minister had a stern warning for foreign tourists thinking of lighting up a joint in public.\n\n“Thailand will promote cannabis policies for medical purposes. If [tourists] come for medical treatment or come for health-related products then it’s not an issue but if you think that you want to come to Thailand just because you heard that cannabis or marijuana is legal … [or] come to Thailand to smoke joints freely, that’s wrong.\n\n“Don’t come. We won’t welcome you if you just come to this country for that purpose.”\n\nAnutin, a former tycoon, also said he hopes the Thai cannabis industry will generate billions of dollars in income by boosting agriculture.\n\n“We expect the value of [the cannabis] industry to easily exceed $2 billion dollars,” he said, highlighting recent incentives such as collaborating with the Agriculture Ministry to distribute 1 million free cannabis plants to households across the country.\n\n“Thailand, from what I was told, is one of the best places to grow cannabis plants,” Anutin said.\n\n“I think Thai people are excited and eager to be players – either as investors or product makers as well as consumers. With today’s technology and marketing strategies, Thailand will be second to none in being able to promote [cannabis] products in the global market.”\n\nA worker inspects marijuana leaves at a farm in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.

Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore than 3,000 inmates serving prison terms for cannabis and hemp-related drug offenses will be released on Thursday following announcements from Anutin’s Public Health Ministry.\n\nAnd huge festivities are planned this weekend. One event organized by Highland Legalization, a Thai marijuana advocacy group, will see two days of musical performances, panel discussions and cannabis food sales.\n\nStill, even with the liberalized law, a touch of paranoia may remain for some. Activists have long complained that loopholes in the law send conflicting messages.\n\nJust weeks ago, a 56-year-old woman was arrested at her home in eastern Chonburi province after plainclothes police officers spotted a potted cannabis plant in her bedroom.\n\nHer husband later clarified that she had high blood pressure and diabetes and they had been cultivating the plant to add to their food.\n\nCommenting on the case, Anutin said the four officers involved had been disciplined.\n\n“They were given warnings and suspended. They did not obey the law we have just established,” Anutin said. “However, we need to [educate] ordinary people and the law enforcers and let them know how far they can go in terms of using cannabis content … within the legal framework. This is what we have been trying to do, to give as much information as we can to educate people.”\n\nKitty Chopaka, a Bangkok-based cannabis entrepreneur who has pushed for legalization for years, welcomed the relaxation.\n\n“The key point of advocating for cannabis legalization is to promote safe and responsible use. [The fact is] cannabis will now be as legal as garlic, there’s no rule or laws imposed to control it,” Chopaka said.\n\nEven so, noting the recent arrests, she advocates a cautious approach.\n\n“[Going forward], it’s probably best to use cannabis in a private space away from people,” Chopaka said. “We don’t want to see people [still going] to jail.”", "authors": ["Kocha Olarn Heather Chen", "Kocha Olarn", "Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/lakeworth/2022/07/09/no-smoking-lake-worth-beach-moves-ban-cigarettes-beach-parks/7818722001/", "title": "No smoking on this Florida beach: Lake Worth to ban cigarettes", "text": "LAKE WORTH BEACH — Looking to spend a day relaxing on the sand and surf at Lake Worth Beach?\n\nKeep your butts at home.\n\nCigarette butts, that is.\n\nThe city has begun work toward passing an ordinance that will prohibit smoking at the beach and municipal parks.

Ron DeSantis in June empowers cities and counties to regulate smoking, overturning previous legislation that bestowed the right to control outdoor smoking only to the state.\n\nOther cities and towns in Palm Beach County, including Boca Raton, Delray Beach and Palm Beach, are also taking steps to remove cigarettes at the beach.\n\nLitter on our beaches:Discarded masks and gloves littering beaches are becoming a big environmental problem\n\nBattle for the beach:Confusion over private and public Palm Beach sand triggers legal complaints\n\nLake Worth Beach City Commissioner Sarah Malega raised the possibility of a smoking ban days after DeSantis signed the bill into law and received support from Mayor Betty Resch and commission colleagues.\n\n\"As soon as the governor put pen to paper on this law, I was like, “OK, let’s go,' \" Malega said.\n\nThe new law specifically exempts unfiltered cigars, meaning that beachgoers can still fire up a stogie unhindered.\n\nThe environmental impact of banning smoking on the beach\n\nBut banning cigarette smoking alone could have a major impact, environmental groups say.\n\nCigarette filters, which are not biodegradable, make up the largest share of debris found on the world's beaches, including Florida's, on an annual basis, according to Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit advocacy group. The filters possess several chemicals proven to be harmful to marine life and other animals.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we as humans are very impactful on the world we come into,\" Malega said. \"This is one way that we can lessen that impact.”\n\nDuring a beach cleanup last month organized by the nonprofit Plastic Symptoms, volunteers found between 200 and 300 cigarette butts on Lake Worth Beach.\n\n\"There was a spot where it looked like somebody was sitting on a towel, smoked their entire pack of cigarettes and stuck every single one of them in the sand,\" said Bryan Galvin, a Delray Beach resident who runs Plastic Symptoms. \"People do use the beach as an ashtray, unfortunately.\"\n\nMany Florida cities and counties have tried to outlaw smoking at the beach, including Sarasota, which had its ban overturned in 2017. A judge ruled that only the state could regulate outdoor tobacco use.\n\nWhat other Palm Beach County cities are considering no smoking on beach?\n\nLake Worth Beach isn't the only city in Palm Beach County planning to do away with smoking on the beach.\n\nBoca Raton Mayor Scott Singer said he plans to introduce an ordinance at the city's next council meeting.\n\n\"Most residents that have contacted me are in favor of a ban,\" Singer said.\n\nDelray Beach is working on updating an existing city ordinance against beach smoking that could not be enforced because of state preemption, according to spokeswoman Gina Carter.\n\nPalm Beach would ban smoking cigarettes at the town's beaches and parks under a new ordinance that will be considered by the Town Council on Tuesday.\n\nBefore an ordinance reaches Lake Worth Beach's commissioners – Malega thinks it could be as long as six months – the city staff will grapple with the details, including how the law will be enforced. Officials agree the job can't be in the hands of lifeguards, so it may fall into the lap of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe hope is that signs referring to smoking's prohibition will be sufficient for beachgoers and park visitors to comply.\n\nMalega said she will push for the commission to include vaping products in the proposed ordinance. She recounted attending an event at Bryant Park recently in which someone she said was vaping marijuana oil exhaled into her face.\n\nIn those type of instances, Malega asks people not to smoke, but says the response is usually \"pushback like, 'This is a free country.' \"\n\nMalega said her motivation is not to be \"heavy handed\" but to leave the city \"in a better place than we found it.\"\n\nJorge Milian is a journalist covering Boynton Beach and Lake Worth Beach at The Palm Beach Post.

But with jurisdictional limitations and huge questions regarding enforcement, it appears likely most golfers will remain free to puff away.\n\nThat’s fine with people like Capobianco.\n\n“I think it’s ridiculous. We’re outside. You know. So people that smoke cigars can't smoke or smoke cigarettes. What does it affect? It ain't affecting people,” the 66-year-old Yorktown resident said.\n\nThe measure has its supporters.\n\nOssining resident Trevor Forde, 71, and his daughter, Sarah, 16 of Tenafly, New Jersey, who Thursday were at Mohansic Golf Course in Yorktown, where Sarah was taking a lesson, pointed to the environmental pluses. The elder Forde cited possible elimination of unwanted cigarette butt litter and his daughter liked the idea of being in a smoke-free environment.\n\nBut Stanley Bell, a former smoker who also lives in Ossining, feels differently.\n\n“On golf courses, it's 99% adults and you're so spread apart that it really doesn't really matter. I mean I play with guys that smoke cigars and I could care less,” the 74-year-old Bell said while practicing shots at Mohansic's driving range.\n\nBell, in fact, considers the law \"ridiculous.\"\n\nStill, the measure, which covers all types of smoking, including vaping and marijuana, was passed by both state houses and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul with little opposition.\n\nSmoking ban's enforceability questioned\n\nIt theoretically bans smoking on both all state and municipal properties that are used for recreational purposes, except for associated parking and walkway areas.\n\nBut the law could conceivably affect only state-run golf courses.\n\nThat’s because, while not explicitly spelled out in its language, the legislation is not designed to supersede local public outdoor smoking ordinances, nor serve as a mandatory addendum to them.\n\nState says no:New York bans smoking in public parks and beaches. Here's why, and what you need to know\n\nIf a county, town or village has any public outdoor smoking ordinance whatsoever, it can choose to ignore the state law, even if local rules don’t cover things like golf courses, explained Pierce Brix, the communications director for state Senator Toby Ann Stavisky (D-Forest Hills), who was one of the law’s chief sponsors.\n\n“The vast majority of the state has localized restrictions. This is not going to step on the feet of them,” said Brix, who said the legislation was “written intentionally broad in scope to be interpreted broadly.”\n\nWhile this may appear to render the legislation largely a toothless tiger, all municipalities may, of course, choose to follow the new law.\n\nAnd, moreover, state courses fall under the directive.\n\nBut local golf officials question how the ban could be enforced, given the fact courses cover so much acreage.\n\n“Nobody is going to enforce that,” Dave Fusco, head pro at Stony Point-owned Patriot Hills Golf Club, bluntly predicted.\n\nHow Hudson Valley golf courses could be affected\n\nWhile Fusco noted that each morning at 7 a.m. his course hosts a group of golfers who approach the first tee with cigars in hand, smoking is not as popular as it once was.\n\nFusco and Patrick Wynn, general manager of the Harrison-owned Harrison Meadows Country Club, both estimate only 10-15% of their patrons smoke on site. So if those courses chose to initiate a ban, opposition would likely be somewhat limited.\n\nNot so at Rockland Lake State Park Golf Course, which, owned by the state, falls under the ban.\n\nRobert Fraioli, Rockland's director of golf, estimated up to 80% of the golfers who frequent his club smoke there.\n\nAnd with 25,000-30,000 rounds played at Rockland each year, that's a lot of golfers.\n\nThrow in the fact golfers are scattered over a large area (Rockland Lake is actually two courses) and there's the question of who's going to be assigned to search tees, fairways, greens and woods for violators, who, according to the law, face $50 fines for each offense.\n\n“How would we enforce it? I don’t see any way for us to enforce it,” said Fraioli, who noted the state parks department had considered a ban a few years ago but ultimately didn’t go through with it.\n\nGirls golf stars:Scarsdale freshman Emma Lee headlines the 2022 lohud All-Star team\n\nBoys golf stars:Repeat champ Sean Stead is Rockland's best again; see the 2022 All-County team\n\nThe second local state course that will feel the ban's impact is James Baird in Pleasant Valley. Currently, smoking is allowed there, according to one golf course worker.\n\nThe no-smoking measure, signed into law July 15, becomes effective August 3.\n\nBut regardless of the date, means of enforcement appears to be an overriding question.\n\nWestchester County’s multiple golf courses are on its parkland and smoking is banned at county parks. But parks spokesman Linda Lovallo admitted that it’s impossible to stop all smoking on county courses, since the sites total more than 18,000 acres.\n\nShe said county golf course workers respond to smoking complaints.\n\nSmoking not a problem at Hudson Valley golf courses\n\nBut golf course smoking doesn't appear to be a major issue in the Hudson Valley.\n\nJim Monaghan, the supervisor of Stony Point, which owns Patriot Hills, said, “I’ve never heard of anyone making a complaint about smoking (at Patriot Hills).”\n\nHis town has smoking restrictions at its parks (the course is not designated as such) and, therefore, does not need to abide by the new state law.\n\nWhether the Town of Wallkill will have to codify its existing outdoor smoking policies to avoid enacting the ban at Wallkill Country Club is unclear.\n\nBut Town Clerk Louisa Ingrassia, who remarked golfers at the club have been known to enjoy cigars, said, while not actual law, \"no smoking\" signs are posted at what is the largest of the town's 13 parks, as well at its Little League field.\n\nPutnam County Deputy Commissioner of Parks Chris Ruthven noted Putnam bans smoking in its county parks. But Putnam County Golf Course is not on designated parkland and smoking is allowed there.\n\nWhile that seems unlikely to change, if that or any of the public courses he plays adopts a smoking ban, they can probably forget seeing Capobianco again.\n\nAfter initially indicating he'd reluctantly abide by any ban that's instituted, the 40-year smoker reconsidered.\n\nIf the public courses he plays institute a ban, he said, he'll simply join a private club that allows smoking.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/homelessness/2022/11/29/homeless-issue-atlantic-beach-bans-loitering-sleeping-public-florida/10774862002/", "title": "Homeless issue: Atlantic Beach bans loitering, sleeping in public", "text": "The Atlantic Beach City Commission approved a controversial new ordinance that would prohibit sleeping or camping on city streets, parks and other public places, but offer homeless people shelter and other resources before making arrests.\n\nCity officials also are pondering recommendations from outgoing Mayor Ellen Glasser to be more active in area efforts to help the homeless.\n\nOver the past few weeks, community questions about how the ordinance would impact homeless people spurred positive discussions, Glasser said.\n\n\"The opportunity that came to us … was really a wonderful one,\" she said. \"I was surprised by the reaction. People want to talk about this.\"\n\nFor the mayor, it's personal: Atlantic Beach bans smoking at the beach and in parks\n\nIn its Monday night meeting, the commission unanimously adopted an ordinance that states: \"No person shall loiter, lounge or sleep in or upon any street, park or public place or in any public building or obstruct the access to any public building … or obstruct passage through or upon any public street, park or public place.\"\n\nThe law will require police officers to first provide violators with a list of shelters and other community resources and, if necessary, provide transportation. If no shelter space is available or violators don't want to use them, they would only be arrested if they refuse to move on, are somehow endangering public health and safety or have committed other crimes.\n\nThe commission also approved Glasser's recommendation to help fund a local cold weather shelter program run by St. Paul's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church and Mission House, a nearby day center that provides meals, clothing, showers and other services for homeless people. The church, which provides shelter, and the day center, which provides food, will each receive $1,500.\n\nAtlantic Beach day shelter: Mission House remodels to better serve homeless\n\n\"It's a start,\" she said.\n\nOther topics of discussion\n\nGlasser's other recommendations, which were not voted on Monday night, included:\n\nStrengthening the \"intergovernmental effort\" to help local homeless people access county resources.\n\nDiscussing the feasibility of a \"co-responder program\" — embedding social workers or licensed mental health workers within police departments — possibly in conjunction with an existing Jacksonville Sheriff's Officers program.\n\nWorking with the Sulzbacher center in Jacksonville, which provides comprehensive services to the homeless, to add the Beaches to its mobile health service rotation.\n\nWorking with the Mental Health Resource Center to help local homeless people get crisis services.\n\nThose suggestions can answer \"where we can go from here to make things better,\" Glasser said. \"We don't have a sizeable homeless population but … this is an opportunity to engage and do better outreach.\"\n\nMichaele McAvoy, interim executive director of Mission House, said she was happy to hear about the cold-weather shelter program receiving city funding. But she was even more excited about Glasser's meeting last week with her and representatives of Sulzbacher and Changing Homelessness, the area agency for homeless prevention.\n\nThe group talked about \"the intersection between social services and law enforcement\" and how Atlantic Beach can help bridge the gap, as well as the co-responder concept, among other things, she said.\n\nConstitutional considerations\n\nThe new ordinance stemmed from citizen complaints about a homeless person at the Beaches Town Center, as well as the ramifications of an 11th District Court of Appeals ruling. The ruling found that ordinances making homelessness illegal are unconstitutional but also that \"sleeping out of doors is not a fundamental right,\" according to a city staff report.\n\nThe current loitering ordinance was revised to accommodate both legalities.\n\nAccording to a staff report, \"People using these areas as living spaces can raise concern about public safety related to such issues as unsanitary conditions and unfettered access for all citizens who need to share these public spaces.\n\nThe ordinance \"is consistent with current case law and represents a best-practices approach to protect all citizens in our city while recognizing the need to respect the constitutional right of people to travel freely,\" according to the report.\n\nWhat are other Florida areas doing?:Jacksonville seeks solutions to combat housing crisis\n\nVeteran housing: Jacksonville apartment complex boosts affordable housing options for homeless veterans\n\nAtlantic Beach Police Chief Victor Gualillo said officers will warn violators first, then provide them with a list of available shelters and services and provide transportation. Only when such assistance fails to produce results would an arrest occur.\n\nIn such cases, an arrest \"is not the first option the city … or the Police Department wants to use,\" he said.\n\nOver the past three years, there have been no arrests under the current loitering law, Gualillo said. Officers recently spent an hour with a homeless man who was new to the area, encouraging him to go to a shelter. After they \"built a rapport\" with him, he agreed to go to Sulzbacher, the chief said.\n\n\"Atlantic Beach is a … microcosm of what's going on across the country. Unfortunately, police departments are on the leading edge,\" he said. \"Officers out there are trying to do the right thing.\"\n\nHaving a co-responder program, with social workers or licensed mental health workers, Gualillo said, would be a \"great idea, one more tool to help people.\"\n\nPending issues\n\nJacksonville attorney A. Wellington Barlow commended the city on the \"mercy\" included in the ordinance. But he said some gray areas could lead to litigation, such as a reference to police officers making \"reasonable attempts\" to find shelter space.\n\nJacksonville has about 3,400 homeless people, but only 1,100 or so emergency shelter beds. The continuing affordable housing crisis in the area makes finding permanent housing difficult.\n\nFormer Atlantic Beach Mayor Bill Guilliford, who later served on the Jacksonville City Council, noted that additional shelter space will be available once Sulzbacher's new men's campus is completed.\n\nHelp for the homeless: Jacksonville City Council approves Sulzbacher's $36 million homeless prevention complex\n\nLocation rift: Sulzbacher shifts Jacksonville site for apartments, jobs for homeless men\n\nAlso, he noted that there is no overnight homeless shelter in the Beaches communities and efforts to place one would likely produce many \"not in my backyard\" complaints from residents.

Oklahoma City, for example, has issued just two citations since implementing its own ban in early 2020, according to records obtained by The Oklahoman.\n\nThe Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust, which focuses on tobacco cessation and prevention programs, awards its Healthy Incentive Grants for Communities for smoke-free ordinances, in addition to worksite wellness measures and community action.\n\nTSET’s grants also are based on population size. For example, from grant years 2012 to 2021, Muskogee, McAlester and Shawnee received $120,000. Hobart, Lindsay and Perkins each received $2,000.\n\n“We think that tobacco-free ordinances, which include vaping, is the best way to protect the public from secondhand vape smoke, and it also promotes health in the community as a whole,” said Thomas Larson, director of public information and outreach for TSET.\n\nSpencer has not yet received a TSET healthy incentive grant, Larson confirmed.\n\nSafety debate surrounding e-cigarettes\n\nVaporizers use battery-operated heaters to form a vapor containing nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals inhaled by the user. They also can deliver marijuana or other substances.\n\nAdvocates say attempts to ban vaping are misguided at best.\n\n“Lumping vapor products with combustible cigarettes, first of all, it’s not backed up by science, and second it creates confusion by consumers and everyday people,” said Alex Clark, CEO of the nonprofit Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association. “They are wildly different in terms of safety. Vaping is safer.”\n\nThe safety of vaping has been debated since its inception, with researchers on both sides, often funded by advocates on both sides, producing papers that either champion the practice or warn against it.\n\nDuring a surge of vaping-related deaths reported in 2019, USA Today published a point-counterpoint article featuring researchers debating the chemical amounts in vapes, whether vaping causes disease and to what extent it helps people quit cigarettes.\n\nIn September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 11% of high school students and fewer than 3% of middle school students nationwide said they were recent users of vaping products and e-cigarettes.\n\nThe numbers marked about a 40% drop from 2020, which some attribute to tougher laws against sales to minors, and the lack of access during the COVID-19 pandemic when millions of students were shut in and forced to take classes from home.\n\nOklahoma City dug up the road in to a popular brewery. The owners want payback for lost sales.\n\nTeen vape use tops 2 million in 2021\n\nMore than 2 million youths were estimated to be e-cigarette users in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, a study published online in January in the the journal Thorax said secondhand vape exposure was associated with increased risk of bronchitic symptoms and shortness of breath in young adults, even after accounting for active smoking and vaping.\n\nThe study of nearly 2,100 high school juniors and seniors in southern California showed “secondhand nicotine vape exposure reported at the time of symptom reporting was associated with statistically significant 40% greater odds of bronchitic symptoms and 53% greater odds of shortness of breath.”\n\nIn Oklahoma, at least one researcher says vaping is safer than smoking cigarettes, but there are pitfalls.\n\n“With vaping, you're exposed to nicotine, but with smoking you're exposed to 3,000 chemicals, and among those are the ones that cause lung cancer,” said Hal Scofield, a physician and scientist with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. “Likely, secondhand delivery of nicotine and other products in vaping — much of that is proprietary and you don't know exactly what they are. What they are is probably increasing the risk of bronchitis and asthma.\"\n\nSchofield cautioned that vaping can be a gateway to cigarette use, saying young people who continue vaping are increasingly doing it daily, which means they have developed an addiction.\n\n“You become addicted to nicotine and that leads to a lot of people using traditional nicotine products which leads to all the serious problems (like COPD) and heart disease,” he said. “Nicotine is a really powerful, addictive substance and very hard to stop. Surveys of middle schoolers and high schoolers (show they) do not know they're using nicotine and becoming addicted to it.”\n\nMore:Oklahoma Tourism leader resigns, state files lawsuit against Swadley's after parks deal\n\nCould bars and restaurants be next to ban vaping?\n\nSchofield said vaping bans in public places are likely a precursor to bans in restaurants and bars.\n\n“What got smoking banned in those places was data about secondhand smoke being harmful,” he said. “Now with data about secondhand vaping being harmful, those things will pick up across the country and certainly in places like restaurants and bars.”\n\nLarson, with TSET, said municipal vaping bans are consistent with tobacco-use prohibitions.\n\n“This is updating a lot of the tobacco-free ordinances to include vaping,” he said.\n\nClark, the pro-vape advocate, said such bans are fruitless.\n\n“These bans on vaping outdoors, in parks and beaches and parking lots owned by the city or county isn’t actually protecting anybody,” he said. “I know they say it de-normalizes the behavior, but young people pick up more from their parents. One of the leading indicators as to whether or not a young person will use tobacco products, drugs or alcohol is whether their parents or guardian uses the product, as well.”\n\nWhether local prohibitions against vaping on public property will be enforced is also up for debate.\n\nOklahoma City leaders approved a ban in early 2020 that coincided with the adoption of a state law that made vaping and smoking of medical marijuana subject to the same restrictions for tobacco. The city code regulates both smoking and vaping on property owned and operated by the city.\n\nThe Oklahoman submitted a public information request to the Municipal Court, seeking copies of all citations for vaping in a prohibited area issued since 2020.\n\nThere were two citations for smoking in a prohibited area, but it is unclear whether they were for vaping, or smoking something else.\n\nOne citation was issued to a man near Quail Creek Road and N May Avenue, with a fine of $178.\n\nThe other was issued near Will Rogers World Airport. The man was listed as a transient from Texas. He refused to sign the citation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/07/07/eatontown-long-branch-ocean-township-tinton-falls-happenings-news-events/459795001/", "title": "Townhouses will replace shuttered tavern in West Long Branch", "text": "What's hAPPening is a column about Eatontown, Long Branch, Ocean Township and Tinton Falls.

Fields Public House bar on Wall St. will be demolished for 16 townhouses.\n\nThe developer is Highview Homes, based in Red Bank, which said demolition of the bar will take place after Labor Day. The real estate co. said it has applied to the borough for demolition permits.\n\nThe building is adjacent to University Subs and Deli.\n\nTinton Falls Library temporarily closed for mold\n\nThe Tinton Falls Public Library will be temporarily closed due to mold, according to a statement from the borough on Friday.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the borough said the library will be temporarily closed while a full evaluation is being conducted. The borough said patrons can hold on to library materials until the library re-opens and fines will be waived for overdue books resulting from this closure.\n\nAll library materials can also be returned to the Monmouth County Library Eastern Branch in Shrewsbury.\n\nLong Branch bans e-cigarettes from beaches, parks\n\nUsers of e-cigarettes have fewer places they can vape after city officials banned electronic cigarettes at the beach, boardwalk, promenade and city parks Tuesday night.\n\nThe measure also increased the number of places where cigarette smoking will be prohibited to include the boardwalk, parks and promenades. The city previously only prohibited smoking only at the beach.\n\nCity official cited complaints from residents to second smoke vapor when as the reason for the prohibitory ordinances.\n\nThe ban extends to the Gazebo at Pier Village, the band shells at West End Park and Broadway Park, the Great Lawn, Senior Center and city parking lots.\n\nEatontown police sergeant retires\n\nAfter 24 years in the Eatontown Police Department, Sgt. David L. Brown has retired from the force.\n\nBrown, 49, was hired by the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office in 1990 and was hired as a patrolman in Eatontown in 1994.\n\nEatontown promoted officer Matthew Williams, 49, to sergeant. Williams has 23 years service in law enforcement.\n\nMall Redesign: Monmouth Mall's future awaits judge's decision on lawsuit\n\nThe borough added two new patrolmen Craig Sweeney, 26 and Eric Krozser, 24, to the department.\n\nThe retirement of Brown and the addition of two new patrolmen brings Eatontown's total police force to 37 members, according to Police Chief Michael Goldfarb.\n\nThe borough's police payroll is about $4 million, according to pension data.\n\nWomen's Council raises $200,000 for cancer treatment\n\nThe Women’s Council for the Leon Hess Cancer Center at Monmouth Medical Center 22nd annual Power of Pink luncheon raised more than $200,000 for the patient infusion unit at the center, said Rebecca Smith, of R & J Strategic Communication, the public relations company used RJW Barnabas Health.\n\nMonmouth Medical Center is part of the Barnabas network.\n\nWorkshop: Cancer Support Community at Monmouth Medical Center presents Medicare & You\n\nThe keynote speaker for the event was award-winning journalist Tamron Hall.

Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J) announced July 12 that the City of Long Branch has been awarded a $562,680 federal grant for its fire department from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program. The grant will enhance Long Branch’s ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as its first-responders, by updating its respiratory equipment, according to a statement from Palone.\n\nThe equipment includes self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), face protectors, and radio equipment for helmets.\n\n“Our brave firefighters deserve the best equipment possible as they put their lives on the line for us,” said Pallone. “This funding will make a difference locally by making it safer for local firefighters and first responders to do their job and save lives.”\n\nPolice Chief: Long Branch getting police chief forfirst time in 50 years\n\nWest End: Long Branch movie theater coming down soon for synagogue\n\nThe AFG program is sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security and is part of a coordinated effort to improve the nation’s ability to respond to emergency situations. Since its implementation in 2001, the AFG program has provided over $6 billion to fire departments and EMS organizations across the country.\n\nLong Branch looks to ban e-cigarettes\n\nThe city is looking to prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes at the beach, boardwalk, promenade and city parks.\n\nKevin Hayes, the city's acting business administrator, said the city has received complaints from beachgoers and park visitors over second-hand vapor caused by users of the products.\n\nThe city prohibits smoking only at the beach. The City Council approved the city's administration to go forward and update park and beach ordinances to extend the prohibition to both cigarettes and electronic cigarettes.\n\nAny ordinance changes would then have to go through a public introduction, hearing and adoption.\n\nMunicipal Court Shared Service Agreement\n\nEatontown and Tinton Falls have renegotiated a five-year shared service agreement for municipal court services.\n\nEatontown can use Tinton Falls court for $275,000 a year, according to the terms of the deal, which begins Aug.1, 2017 and ends July 31, 2022. The deal can be renewed.\n\nThe payment is $150,000 more than a prior shared service agreement between the neighboring boroughs, which Tinton Falls terminated by way of a resolution on Feb. 7.\n\nThe original shared service agreement was approved August 2013 and amended July 8, 2015.\n\nHow we got here: Eatontown Council members deny 'backroom deal' for judge\n\nEatontown's appointment of a new municipal judge in January, different than the one used by Tinton Falls was the impetus for Tinton Falls to end the shared-service deal with Eatontown for the municipal court. Tinton Falls Mayor Gerald Turing said in March the judge was not as efficient and cost savings were not being realized as a result.\n\nThe new shared service agreement allows Eatontown to use its own choice of municipal judge.\n\nEatontown's Chicken Ordinance\n\nUPDATE: Eatontown's mayor vetos chickens; council to vote again\n\nEatontown’s Borough Council voted 4 to 2 in favor of a land use measure that would allow residents to keep chickens at the June 28 council meeting.\n\nThe measure would allow residents to keep chickens on properties of five acres or less.\n\nHowever, before the ordinance can go into effect it must be signed by Mayor Dennis Connelly, who has opposed the birds in his public comments.\n\nIf he exercises his power to veto the measure, the borough council would need a supermajority (four of six affirmative votes) to override a veto by the mayor. Connelly has 10 days from June 28 to exercise the veto.\n\nHow we got here: Eatontown takes a step closer to a chicken vote\n\nBorough Administrator George Jackson said as of June 30 Connelly had not signed the measure.\n\nResidents that opposed the chickens raised concerns at the June 28 meeting that the measure might create conflicts between neighbors.\n\n\"I think we're setting ourselves up for a lot of border wars along the fences,\" said Eatontown resident and former councilman Richard Robinson.\n\nEatontown's Ordinance\n\nThe ordinance allows residents to keep as many as five to 12 chickens on single-family residential lots less than five acres. The number of chickens is based on lot size.\n\nRoosters or male chickens are not be permitted.\n\nResidents need to pass an education class on the keeping of poultry and obtain a license from the Borough Clerk at a fee of $25 before obtaining chickens. The license must be renewed annually.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@gannettnj.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/army-brigade-alcohol-ban-germany/index.html", "title": "US troops in Germany banned from alcohol after scooter incidents ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA US Army brigade in Germany has been confined to its base during evenings and temporarily banned from consuming alcohol, a spokesman for the Army said Thursday, after five troops were charged with driving scooters under the influence in Nuremberg over the July 4 holiday weekend.\n\nAll five soldiers were together on the July Fourth weekend when they were charged with being over the legal alcohol limit, according to John Tomassi, the US army spokesman in Europe. The Army is investigating the incident, he added.\n\nThe entire 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team – which includes about 3,000 soldiers – was told they could no longer spend nights off base, and alcohol has been banned until the entire unit is trained on obeying German driving laws regarding drinking and driving, Tomassi said.

The park was ranked No. 3 last year.\n\nRELATED: (2019) ‘Dr. Beach’ ranks Grayton Beach State Park No. 3\n\nLeatherman is a coastal scientist who has published 20 books and hundreds of scientific articles, and reports on storm impacts, coastal erosion and ways to improve beach health and safety.

I started giving more priority to beach safety and smoking,” Leatherman said.\n\nSmoking is still allowed at Grayton, which Leatherman admits the park’s features had to overcome. But its attributes were hard to ignore.\n\nThe seemingly untouched nature that exists in the dunes and coastal dune lakes at Grayton put it at the top of the list, according to Leatherman.\n\nRELATED: PHOTOS: Brothers haul in black tip shark near Grayton Beach State Park\n\n“Grayton Beach is a special place. It has really white sand. It’s really a majestic place. ... There’s nothing else like it in the world, really.”\n\nHe also noted that it’s a safe place to be for social distancing because of the mile-long beach area, trails and watersport activities that are available to patrons. The trails pass through big sand dunes and along salt marshes. The park sits on Western Lake, one of many rare coastal dunes lakes in the area.\n\n“Waves are generally measured in inches, so the water is safe unless an onshore wind has kicked up the surf, in which case it is best to stay out of the water and explore the rest of this nearly 2,000-acre nature park. The mile of sugar sand is also great for surf fishing and beachcombing,“ Leatherman said in a press release.\n\nThe news of Grayton’s No. 1 designation made national news Thursday.

A statement issued Wednesday by the Alabama Historical Commission says remains of the Gulf schooner Clotilda have been identified and verified after months of assessment. The commission’s executive director, Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, calls the discovery “an extraordinary archaeological find.” In 1860 the wooden ship illegally transported 110 people from what is now the west African nation of Benin to Mobile. The Clotilda was then taken into delta waters north of the port and burned. The captives were later freed and settled a community that’s still called Africatown.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly has adopted a climate action plan setting goals for the city. Alaska Public Media reported Wednesday that officials voted Tuesday to adopt the 100-page document outlining aims such as reducing carbon emissions by 80% within 30 years. The measure passed 8-2, with both Eagle River assembly members opposed. The action plan is primarily a set of nonbinding proposals to guide municipal entities toward more environmentally friendly policies. All 22 members of the public who testified at the meeting favored the measure. Many spoke about the evidence of climate change observed in their lives such as warmer winters, worsening tree pollen, invasive insect species and heightened wildfire conditions.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers are poised to consider tripling the amount of cash they’re paid for each day they work in new legislation that emerged as their yearly session nears a close. Lawmakers in both parties appeared supportive of the change Thursday. They said rural lawmakers especially are undercompensated for their costs of traveling to and staying in Phoenix during the session. They also note that federal tax law changes eliminated the ability to write off those expenses. Lawmakers earn $24,000 a year, plus a daily expense stipend that currently is $60 for rural lawmakers and $35 for Maricopa County residents. The Senate bill introduced Thursday raises the daily rate for rural lawmakers to the federal rate of $185 a day and half that for Phoenix-area residents. The rate would adjust yearly.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor has announced 15 new Cabinet secretaries under a state agency reorganization that cut the number of departments answering directly to him. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday said the new secretaries will begin work in July under the reorganization plan that lawmakers approved earlier this year. The plan cut the number of Cabinet-level agencies from 42. The new secretaries include Jami Cook, who will head the new Department of Public Safety that includes State Police, the Crime Lab and the Department of Emergency Management. Cook currently heads the Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Training. State Department of Heritage Director Stacy Hurst will head the new Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. State Economic Development Director Mike Preston will head the new Department of Commerce.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Trump administration will not immediately give $1 billion it revoked from the state’s high-speed rail project to another project, according to a legal agreement reached Wednesday between the two sides. The Federal Railroad Administration announced last week that it was revoking the money, prompting California to sue on Tuesday. Beyond the lawsuit, the state planned to seek a temporary restraining order halting the federal government from giving the money to a different rail project. The new agreement means the state won’t file the restraining order, but it does not change the status of the lawsuit. California is trying to build a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a venture expected to cost upward of $77 billion. The $929 million is for a segment of track already under construction in the Central Valley that must be completed by 2022.\n\nColorado\n\nHighlands Ranch: Construction workers have unearthed fossils in a Denver suburb that experts say could be from a rare horned dinosaur. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science said Monday that it is exploring the construction site near a retirement community in Highlands Ranch where a dinosaur’s lower leg bone and several ribs were found. Fossil expert Natalie Toth told KDVR-TV the fossils could be from a torosaurus – a dinosaur similar to the triceratops but differentiated by three bones. Toth says the fossils seem to be intact, so crews are hoping to uncover the entire dinosaur. The fossils are embedded in a rock layer 66 million to 68 million years old. Toth says fossils in the Denver formation are from dinosaurs that were among the last “walking around before the big extinction.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The local police department has reached a deal with a fugitive that would have him surrender if enough people respond to a wanted poster on social media, an agreement that at least one expert calls unethical. Jose Simms, 29, who is believed to be somewhere in New York, has seven arrest warrants and is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page Wednesday that Sims had contacted him through the social media site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster gets 15,000 likes. Johnson said he negotiated Simms down from 20,000 likes. “It will be difficult but is doable,” he wrote.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Those who love people-watching and checking out the sights and sounds of nature at the state’s beaches but can’t make it out for Memorial Day weekend – or aren’t fans of dealing with sand, sunscreen and sea creatures – have an option to get their fix online. Southern Delaware Tourism maintains a list of online live cameras available in the area, so people can tune into the shorebirds aflutter along the Delaware Bay or the Boardwalk cruisers from the comfort of their own couch. “It’s such a great tool to be able to help visually relay what a great scene it is here along the coastline,” says Scott Thomas, executive director at Southern Delaware Tourism.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Officials of the Metropolitan Area Transit Authority say part of the transit train system is set to shut down for 15 weeks, affecting an estimated 17,000 riders per day. News outlets report the six-station shutdown is set to start Saturday and will be the longest in Metro history. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld urged affected riders on Wednesday to explore other commuting options, such as working from home or carpooling. Officials say more buses will be available. This shutdown is part of a three-year platform reconstruction project and will affect Braddock Road, King Street-Old Town, Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington, Van Dorn and Franconia-Springfield stations. This project portion is expected to cost about $200 million. The transit agency hopes to rebuild 20 station platforms by the end of 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nOlga: With no fanfare, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has quietly closed a well-loved Caloosahatchee River beach. This week, staff will start sodding over the sand that slopes to the river at the W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam. Though the swimming area was often barricaded for high fecal bacteria levels, it was Lee County’s only official upriver swimming hole, the site of many a kid’s birthday and al fresco wedding. The Florida Department of Health in Lee County will no longer sample the water there for dangerous bacteria, spokeswoman Tammy Yzaguirre said. In rural Olga some 30 miles upriver from the Gulf, the beach is just one of its 154 miles of navigable waterway the Corps supervises between the Franklin and the St. Lucie locks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two film projects have pulled production from the state after the governor signed the so-called heartbeat bill, which bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The heartbeat can be detected as early as six weeks, before many women realize they’re pregnant. The Lionsgate comedy “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,” starring Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, and director Reed Morano’s Amazon series “The Power” initially were to be shot in Georgia but now will relocate production. Morano did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday but told Time she had been scheduled to fly to Savannah to scout locations for the new TV series. She canceled after Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill. The measure is set to go into effect Jan. 1.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The first breeding attempt by a pair of Hawaiian crows in the wild in nearly 20 years appears to have failed. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports officials at the Puu Makaala Natural Area Reserve did not find offspring at a nest the birds built. Researchers at the state park on the Big Island saw the crows, Manaolana and Manaiakalani, display behavior associated with egg incubation earlier this month, but then found no sign of chicks in the nest beyond the point when eggs would be expected to hatch. While the female, Manaiakalani, continues to act as though incubating, researchers say it is normal for alala – the Hawaiian name for the crows – to perch on infertile or otherwise nonviable eggs until realizing they will not hatch.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials are taking public comments on a plan to build a 16.5-mile power line at an eastern Idaho nuclear site as part of a cybersecurity effort to bolster protections for the nation’s electric grid. The U.S. Department of Energy announced Tuesday that it’s taking comments through June 21 on the plan to build the power line at the 890-square-mile federal site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. Officials say the proposed 138-kilovolt powerline will make it easier to conduct experiments at the Idaho National Laboratory’s Power Grid Test Bed. The Idaho National Laboratory contains one of the United States’ primary cybersecurity facilities that uses the existing power grid at the site for experiments to make electric grids around the U.S. more secure from potential hackers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Fair karaoke contest is returning this summer, and the winner will get to perform on the fair’s biggest stage. Organizers say nine regional county fairs will host qualifying rounds of State Fair Karaoke this summer. The top two winners from the regional contests will compete at the finale at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield on Aug. 11. The overall winner will be chosen that day. Fair Manager Kevin Gordon says it’s a great opportunity for local talent to perform on the grandstand stage. It’s also another type of free entertainment for people attending the fair. Competitors must be a solo act and at least 18. The contest is free to enter, but space is limited. Competitors are encouraged to pre-register on the fair website.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Quinto sleeps about 15 hours a day and covers his face with a blanket. If enough moss is in his habitat, some could grow in his fur and turn him sort of green. The 15-year-old is part of a group of two-toed sloths who are the first of the mammals ever to reside at the Indianapolis Zoo. The group will live part of the time in the new MISTery Park, one of two new permanent experiences the zoo is unveiling this Memorial Day weekend. The other, in contrast to the cuddly mammals, is “Size, Speed & Venom: Extreme Snakes,” which includes black mambas, pythons and rattlesnakes. The exhibits are different enough that the zoo is instituting a competition between the two – visitors which choose which team they’re on at the end of their visit.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The U.S. General Services Administration has released concept drawings of the approved design for the new U.S. Courthouse planned along the city’s riverfront. The GSA said in a release that the design concept for the $137 million building remains subject to minor modifications, according to budgetary, operational and security requirements. The federal courthouse is planned to be built at the former YMCA site along the riverfront. The project has been controversial, with Des Moines leaders fighting GSA’s plans to build at the site for years. Local officials have said that it won’t be in the best interest of a city that has been working to revitalize the riverfront for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.\n\nKansas\n\nScott City: The state is relying on its conservation effort to protect the lesser prairie chicken as an ecotourism attraction that is attracting birdwatchers from across the world. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism officials are working with ranchers and tour groups to meet the high demand for areas to view the vulnerable species of grouse. The department’s outdoor content manager, Michael Pearce, says western Kansas is one of the last remaining places with a sustainable native population of lesser prairie chickens. The tourism aspect has taken off recently, and the state is trying to hand off the project to private citizens. Tour organizer Jim Millensifer says Kansas ranches have had more than 200 people from 11 countries visit for guided tours.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s Division of Waste Management is giving grants to five counties to use recycled rubber tires to repave roadways. The $502,000 in grant funding will be used for rubber-modified asphalt projects that use crumb rubber manufactured from waste tires. The grants were announced by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, which oversees the waste management division. Cabinet Secretary Charles Snavely says the grant program is valuable because it promotes the use of recycled rubber from discarded tires. The counties of Clark, Fayette, Hardin, Hopkins and Pulaski received the grants. The state’s Waste Tire Trust Fund collects a $2 fee from the sale of each new tire in the state. The funding helps manage millions of scrap tires discarded each year and develops markets for recycled tire products.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents of an island that’s sinking into the Gulf of Mexico are working with legal representatives and case managers hoping to help them relocate. Louisiana’s Office of Community Development Executive Director Pat Forbes tells The Houma Courier that representatives have been working with Isle de Jean Charles residents for several weeks. The island has lost about 98% of its land over the past 60 years. It has 40 residents, many of whom belong to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw or the United Houma Indians tribes. Resettlement options include moving into a planned 150-home community or getting funding for a home elsewhere. Forbes says residents don’t have a deadline to decide, though federal funding for the project must be used by September 2022. He says construction may start on the community this year.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The National Park Service says numerous improvements are taking place at Acadia National Park over the coming months. The service says work has begun at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center, and work is slated to begin on the Frazer Point Pier early in July. Hiking trails are also scheduled for improvements. Some work is already finished, including the rehabilitation of historic firepits at Seawall Campgrounds. Acadia National Park is one of Maine’s top tourist destinations in the summer months. It’s famous for Cadillac Mountain, the high point of the North Atlantic’s seaboard. The park service says the maintenance projects are paid for via methods including park entrance fees, federal funding and fundraising.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Two male grey seals rescued by the National Aquarium earlier this year were released Thursday at the city’s beach. Choppy waves and a windy, cloudy morning greeted the two semi-aquatic mammals as they were released from their crates. Keeping in line with the nonprofit’s 2019 theme of naming seals after influential scientists, the National Aquarium Animal Rescue Team dubbed the rescuees Edwin Hubble and George Washington Carver. Hubble was found stranded in St. Augustine, Florida – several hundred miles out of the normal range for grey seals, who usually don’t go south of North Carolina. Sea World took him in, and from there, rescuers up and down the Atlantic Coast coordinated a relay for Hubble. He eventually landed in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Carver was found in early April just south of where he and Hubble were released Thursday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: A slab of rock that bears dinosaur footprints is being donated to Amherst College by authorities who seized it as part of a poaching case. Massachusetts Environmental Police turned the fossil trackway over to the school’s museum of natural history Thursday. It’s believed to bear the tracks of Eubrontes giganteous, a large dinosaur that lived about 190 million years ago. The specimen was taken as evidence in a 2004 case involving poaching in the rich fossil beds of western Massachusetts. The case led to passage of a law protecting fossils and artifacts on public land. After finishing their investigation, police offered it to Amherst’s natural history museum in February. The museum, which says it has the world’s largest collection of fossil dinosaur tracks, was glad to take it.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: A nonprofit tree-planting and education organization is seeking the largest trees in the state. Ann Arbor-based ReLeaf Michigan says its 14th Michigan Big Tree Hunt Contest runs through Sept. 3. Certificates and prizes will be awarded for the largest tree submitted from each of the state’s counties, for the largest tree found by someone 15 and younger and 16 and older, and for the largest eastern white pine in the state. The Michigan Big Tree Hunt was started in 1993 to celebrate the state’s beauty and gather information about its biggest trees. Contest entries provide potential state champion trees to Michigan’s Big Tree Registry as well as the National Register of Big Trees. ReLeaf Michigan partners with communities to replenish the state’s tree canopies by planting trees in public spaces.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Minnesota State has agreed to pay up to $1.9million to settle a wage dispute with faculty at its two-year colleges. The Minnesota State College Faculty union has been fighting since 2010 over wage calculations for faculty who do certain jobs, such as teaching independent studies or coordinating internships. The union prevailed at arbitration in 2016 but argued the public higher education system refused to comply with that ruling. The faculty sued Minnesota State in Ramsey County District Court in December 2017, alleging unfair labor practices. Responding to that lawsuit, Minnesota State said it paid faculty in accordance with the arbitration ruling but maintained it was not required to change practices going forward. The settlement announced Wednesday brings an end to that lawsuit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Wildlife are struggling to survive as floodwaters cover some of the state’s wildlife management areas. Residents and officials say prey and predators alike are congregating wherever there are dry grounds, adding even more stress to their situation. Roger Tankesly, a Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks wildlife management area biologist for the Delta region, says seven of the state’s more popular wildlife management areas have been completely underwater since January, with some covered in 15 feet of water. David Thornton, 77, of Eagle Lake, says he’s hunted in the area for as long as he can remember. He says the deer have “eaten all the leaves they can reach,” and even raccoons are now wading through water in search for food.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Callers to a state hotline for abuse of elderly or disabled residents frequently can’t get through to anyone. Records obtained by the Columbia Missourian and KBIA radio found only about half of the 92,000 calls to the hotline last year were answered. From January through April, only about 39% of calls were answered. Data obtained through a records request shows the past decade has seen a 35% increase in reports of abuse or exploitation. The Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services added one hotline worker during that time. Jessica Sax, director of the Division of Senior & Disability Services, says the department is first addressing inefficiencies in the hotline before asking for more workers. She says the division also is studying how other states run their hotlines.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Renewable energy activists are urging state regulators to reject a proposal to add a charge for homeowners who generate surplus electricity from their own solar panels. Critics told the Montana Public Service Commission on Thursday that the NorthWestern Energy proposal would kill a burgeoning rooftop solar industry. Over the past two decades, about 2,300 NorthWestern customers in Montana installed their own solar panels. When they generate more electricity than a customer uses, the surplus is fed into the electric grid and earns the customer a credit on their bill in a process known as net-metering. NorthWestern spokeswoman Jo Dee Black says the new charge would ensure net-metering customers pay their fair share of service costs. Officials say the charge would be about $50 a month based on average customer demand.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Omaha Airport Authority is preparing to move forward with a $500 million reconstruction of Eppley Airfield. The Omaha World-Herald reports the project to rebuild the terminal within five years would overhaul its concourse, airline gates, security checkpoints, ticket counters and baggage claim. The Airport Authority is working with contractors to create a preliminary design for the terminal by this fall. The plans come as Eppley Airfield sees steady passenger growth and airline investments. Airlines scheduled a record of more than 6 million seats to fly through Eppley last year. They’ve also doubled the number of nonstop flights from the airport since 2013. Officials are planning to issue long-term revenue bonds to fund the reconstruction.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A company backed by tech billionaire Elon Musk has been granted a nearly $49 million contract to build a transit system using self-driving vehicles underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. The board of directors of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority approved the contract Wednesday with The Boring Co., the Musk-backed enterprise based in Hawthorne, California. The company plans to construct a twin tunnel system running less than a mile long. The system will use self-driving electric vehicles capable of transporting up to 16 people. The system also will include three underground stations and a pedestrian tunnel. The company plans to start construction in September and debut the system by December 2020. The authority will reimburse the company as it completes certain stages of the project.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlymouth: A new exhibit showcases the grand hotels that once were commonplace in the White Mountains. The exhibit at the Museum of the White Mountains at Plymouth State University opened last week, and a series of talks and events runs through Sept. 12. Featuring paintings, photographs and various artifacts as far back as the 1880s, as well as stories of the people who visited and worked at these gracious establishments, the exhibit explores the origins and history of the hotels. Among the highlights will be landscape paintings from residents at several of the hotels including Edward Hill and Frank Shapleigh. A special focus will be on the four surviving hotels: the Omni Mount Washington Resort, Mountain View Grand Resort & Spa, Eagle Mountain House & Golf Club and The Wentworth Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSea Girt: Smoking and vaping will be banned on nearly every public beach in the state this summer under tougher new restrictions. Nonsmokers are rejoicing over the ban, which also applies to public parks. But some smokers are feeling discriminated against by the law, which took effect in January. Fines would start at $250 for a first offense and go up to $1,000 for a third offense. At least 20 Jersey shore towns had already enacted their own smoking bans before the statewide law took effect. Nationwide, more than 300 coastal communities have banned smoking on their beaches. But bans as broad as New Jersey’s are rare. The Clean Ocean Action environmental group counted more than 22,000 cigarette butts its volunteers picked up from New Jersey beaches during spring and fall cleanups last year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The first woman to oversee the state’s multibillion-dollar mineral resources is proposing to do away with gender-specific pronouns such as “he,” “his” or “him” in agency rulebooks. Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says the State Land Office will hold a public hearing Friday in Santa Fe on the proposed changes. Gender-specific pronouns would be replaced by more neutral or specific references. Garcia Richard says current agency rules use male pronouns throughout to refer to her position. She says it’s no surprise that some written wording has grown outdated at the 120-year-old agency. The commissioner has final say on the language changes. The State Land Office oversees energy leases across about 14,000 square miles of state trust land to help fund schools, universities and hospitals.\n\nNew York\n\nWest Point: The class of cadets preparing to jubilantly toss their caps in the air at the U.S. Military Academy’s graduation ceremony Saturday includes 34 black women, a record number that’s a sign of concerted efforts to diversify West Point’s Long Gray Line. West Point remains mostly white and mostly male. “I can show other little girls that yes, you can come to West Point. Yes, you can do something that maybe the rest of your peers aren’t actually doing. And yes, you can be different from the rest of the group,” says senior cadet Stephanie Riley, who was among the black female cadets who recently posed for pre-graduation photos in their gray uniforms, holding out ceremonial sabers. The pictures – part of a tradition for graduating cadets – were posted widely online and became a symbol of West Point’s increasing diversity.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper says his directive that state agencies provide paid leave for workers following a birth means parents will no longer have to choose between their career or their child. Cooper signed an executive order Thursday that offers paid parental leave to state employees in his Cabinet-level departments starting Sept. 1. That’s eight weeks of full paid leave to those who give birth and four weeks to their spouses or partners. Such paid leave is already offered by many private-sector companies. At an Executive Mansion event, Cooper said such leave has been found to increase worker productivity and improve recruitment and retention. Cooper says carrying out the order will cost $3.5 million annually, with his agencies absorbing the expenses from current funds.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: A federal judge has granted a reprieve to the owners of a bar fighting to preserve a mural at their business. U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland granted a temporary restraining order Wednesday two days after the owners of Lonesome Dove filed a lawsuit against the city of Mandan over the mural city officials ordered removed. Bar owners Brian Berube and August “Augie” Kersten were cited for have an unpermitted, Western-themed mural on the outside of the bar. The Bismarck Tribune says Berube and Kersten were unaware of the permit, later applied and were denied because city ordinance states that “no mural may be placed on the front of the building.” The judge says “such a content-based restriction on speech as Mandan has enacted is unlikely to survive constitutional muster.” He scheduled a settlement conference for June 4.\n\nOhio\n\nAlliance: The University of Mount Union has ended its affiliation with the United Methodist Church over the denomination’s renewed bans on LGBT clergy and same-sex marriage. The Canton Repository reports the school’s president says the board of trustees considered the issue for months before voting recently to end the affiliation of more than 150 years. University President W. Richard Merriman Jr. says the school wants a diverse campus. He says it became difficult to see how the denomination’s recent actions could be reconciled with the university’s values. The General Conference of the United Methodist Church in February voted to continue prohibiting ordination of gays and lesbians and barring its clergy from presiding at same-sex weddings. The university says ending the affiliation won’t affect its curriculum.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill that would force more school districts to return to five-day school weeks has been given final legislative approval and is heading to the governor’s desk. A top priority of Senate Republicans this year, the bill passed the House on Wednesday on a 63-32 vote. The state Department of Education says 92 of Oklahoma’s more than 500 school districts currently are operating on four-day school weeks. In those cases, instructional hours are extended each day to reach the required number of hours. Under the bill, schools could continue operating four-day weeks if the district meets minimum guidelines for student performance and cost savings. Supporters of the four-day school week say it helps districts save money and recruit teachers.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A new report says that in future years, the state’s population will mostly grow through people moving into the Beaver State rather than through new births. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis predicts the state will see deaths outnumber births sometime in the next decade. Josh Lehner, a state economist, predicts the flip will happen around 2026 or 2027. It would be the first time in Oregon’s history that deaths outnumber births. The trend is already affecting the state’s more rural counties but now is spreading statewide. As the trend continues, analysts say factors that negatively affect migration to Oregon from other states – such as housing affordability – will have a bigger impact on the economy and the size of public budgets.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says preliminary statistics are pointing to a decrease in overdose deaths in the state last year, as his administration suggests the opioid crisis might be starting to wane in some parts of Pennsylvania. Wolf spoke Wednesday as he participated in a training session on how to administer a nasal spray that reverses an opioid overdose. Wolf says physicians are issuing fewer opioid prescriptions and doctor-shopping is over, thanks to a 2016 law that requires prescribers to check a state database before issuing an opioid prescription to a new patient. His administration says more robust health care outreach and law enforcement programs are paying dividends. It’s also made the anti-overdose medication naloxone regularly available at most pharmacies in Pennsylvania, at little or no cost for those with insurance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A poet has sued the city and a police officer, saying he was racially profiled, assaulted, harassed and falsely arrested three years ago. The Providence Journal reports Christopher Johnson, of Providence, a spoken-word artist and former state poet laureate candidate, is seeking unspecified damages and the firing of the officer. Johnson says he declined to provide his name to the officer, who pulled alongside him in a police SUV while walking home from a concert in May 2016. Johnson says he was grabbed and slammed into the vehicle so hard it left a dent. Charges against Johnson were later dismissed. A police spokeswoman says Johnson never filed a formal complaint with the department.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair this year marks its 150th anniversary of showcasing the state’s agricultural roots. The commemorative event is themed “Prize-Winning Memories” and will be held Oct. 9-20 at Columbia’s fairgrounds. WIS-TV reports the fair will present many special offerings along with traditional favorites including a free, daily big top circus; a Midway with 70+ rides; nearly 70 food stands; arts and crafts displays; pig races; livestock and agricultural exhibits; and stage shows. On July 12 as an early kick-start to the celebration, the fair will host a free outdoor screening of “The Greatest Showman.” The fair was organized in 1869 and is a self-supported, charitable organization, dedicated to preserving and promoting the state’s agricultural roots while supporting statewide education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The South Dakota Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will elect a new bishop next month. The election will take place during the synod assembly May 31 and June 1 at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux Falls. Fifteen names have been pre-identified as potential candidates but will not be official nominees until their names are placed on the ballot by someone at the assembly, according to Sawyer Vanden Heuvel, director of communications for the South Dakota Synod. Any ELCA rostered minister of Word and Sacrament is eligible for the nomination, and the first ballot becomes the ballot of nominations. Nominees will be contacted and allowed to withdraw their names if they so choose by 2 p.m. Friday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A massive new exhibition and entertainment hall is set to open at Elvis Presley’s Graceland with three museum-style exhibits, including one on the late boxing great Muhammad Ali. Graceland officials say the 80,000-square-foot Graceland Exhibition Center opens Saturday to guests visiting the Presley-themed tourist attraction in Memphis. The singer, actor and pop icon lived in the city until his death Aug. 16, 1977. Presley and Ali were known to be friends. Presley once gave Ali a custom-made robe in Las Vegas in the early 1970s. A replica of that robe is part of the Ali exhibit, along with photos of the heavyweight boxing and civil rights champion and other artifacts. Exhibits about motorcycles and the planet Earth also are scheduled to open Saturday.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: City leaders have declared a Confederate statue surplus property and offered to sell it for a minimum $450,000 – what it cost to move the bronze artwork from public view. The Dallas City Council on Wednesday designated the statue, of Robert E. Lee and a young soldier riding horses, available for sale to the highest bidder. The 1935 sculpture by Alexander Phimister Proctor was removed from a park in September 2017 and put in storage. The statue was appraised at $950,000, which Dallas authorities say could pay for removal of the city’s Confederate War Memorial. The Dallas Landmark Commission in March approved a plan to disband the 123-year-old memorial complex, which critics say is racist and not historic. A 65-foot obelisk has stood over Pioneer Park Cemetery since 1961.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State and federal officials have signed an agreement to defer to the state when planning forest projects. The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday that Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue signed the agreement Wednesday. Officials say the deal obligates the U.S. Forest Service to rely on the state’s guidance for designing, implementing and prioritizing projects intended to reduce wildfire risks and promote the health of the state’s 12,500 square miles of forest. Utah officials say they believe the agreement will build on existing programs and investments in restoring degraded forest landscapes. A Utah forest supervisor says the forest service has already prepared and authorized treatment plans on 1,563 square miles of state forest land using mechanical thinning and controlled fires.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Attorney General T.J. Donovan says he’s filed suit against eight members of the family that owns the drug company that manufactures OxyContin, one of the drugs believed to be partly responsible for the opioid crisis. Donovan alleged Tuesday that for over two decades the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma, minimized the health risks of opioids, claiming the prescription drugs were rarely the cause of abuse, addiction or death. Donovan says the Sacklers directed Purdue to promote products that were more dangerous, addictive and lucrative. Last September, the state filed suit against Purdue. In a statement released after the September lawsuit, the company said it shared Vermont’s concerns about the opioid crisis but denied Purdue acted improperly.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A large trash collector in the state will use recycling bins that are partly made from recycled trash. The Central Virginia Waste Management Authority said this week that it ordered 2,000 bins from Israeli company UBQ. The firm uses a patented process that converts municipal waste into a plastic-like composite material. UBQ said the authority is its first U.S. customer. CVWMA serves about 280,000 households in the Richmond area. Executive Director Kim Hynes said it’s testing out the bins, which she said are comprised of 25% of the UBQ material. UBQ says it creates the material by milling anything from banana peels to dirty plastics into a powder. The powder is then placed into a reaction chamber. UBQ says the process produces no greenhouse gas emissions or residual waste.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State and local authorities will now be restricted from asking about people’s immigration status, adding to a West Coast wall of states with so-called sanctuary policies. Gov. Jay Inslee signed a measure Tuesday implementing the new rules. They put Washington among only a handful of states, including California and Oregon, to have enacted statewide sanctuary policies and rank among the strongest statewide mandates in the nation. Police officers in Washington won’t be able to inquire about immigration status except in limited circumstances, and the state attorney general will draw up rules for courthouses, hospitals and other state government facilities aimed at limiting their use as places where federal immigration agents look for people in the country illegally. “We will not be complicit in the Trump administration’s depraved efforts to break up hard-working immigrant and refugee families,” Inslee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLogan: The community is taking a stand against needle exchange programs. News outlets report Logan County commissioners voted this week to draft an ordinance that would outlaw starting a needle exchange program there. Commissioner Danny Godby says officials want to find a way to eliminate dirty needles, but they think a needle exchange would make the problem worse by adding more needles to the mix. Some communities in West Virginia and other states have approved needle exchanges to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV and distribute educational materials about where drug addicts can seek help. A needle exchange in Charleston closed last year over concerns about increased needle litter and other issues.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources board is tweaking the state’s bear hunt structure for the first time since 1980. The new framework calls for six bear management zones rather than the current four. Numeric zone kill limits in DNR rules would end. The agency would instead set limits based on agricultural damage, hunter success and nuisance complaints. The changes could into effect as early as the fall of 2021. The plan called for allowing hunters to use hounds in a newly formed central Wisconsin hunting zone. The board voted 6-1 to remove those provisions, however. Opponents told the board that allowing hounds in the zone would lead to trespassing. Megan Nicholson of the Humane Society of the United States said hunting with hounds is a blight on the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A traditional Native American horse race in the city has been postponed following cold and wet conditions in northeast Wyoming. The Gillette News Record reports the Horse Nations Indian Relay was planned for Saturday and Sunday, but rough track conditions have forced organizers to reschedule the event for Aug. 31 and Sept. 1. The sport involves racers riding without saddles to make three laps around a track. Riders finish each lap on a different horse, so they jump on to a new horse twice during each race. Four to six relay teams compete in every race. The event leads up to the Championship of Champions race in Walla Walla, Washington, in late September.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/24"}]}

Rescuers found just one person alive during the day.\n\nThe cause of Friday morning's cave-in was not known, but neighborhood residents complained of builders using substandard materials — with some expressing fear that their own buildings might also fall down.\n\nBetween 83 and 89 people were in the five-story building when it collapsed, according to residents. Rescuers have pulled 33 people out of the rubble alive since the cave-in, but the searchers have not detected any signs of life recently, Alok Awasthi, local commander of the National Disaster Response Force, said Saturday. Still, he vowed that rescuers would continue to search for the missing people.\n\nIt was the third deadly building collapse in six months in Mumbai, which like much of India has lax building inspections and corruption that can form a deadly combination.\n\nRudiben Parmar sat with several weeping relatives near the rubble on Saturday, waiting for news of the last of five family members who were in the building. Three — a nephew and two of his children — had already been found dead.

Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nRenewed zeal\n\nRather than relax Covid restrictions – as some had hoped for in the lead-up to the Communist Party’s five-yearly leadership reshuffle, Chinese authorities have ramped them up after Xi’s sweeping endorsement of the strategy.\n\n“The 20th Party Congress didn’t provide a timetable for moving away from zero-Covid. Instead it highlighted the importance of sticking to the existing approach,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nThe congress reinforced Xi as an unrivaled supreme leader, and saw him stack the Communist Party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\n“The new political ecology also provided more incentive for local governments to impose more draconian Covid control measures,” Huang said.\n\nA renewed zeal for the policy can be seen most clearly in smaller cities. While metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai can draw on their experiences of major flareups to implement more targeted lockdown measures, smaller cities with no such know-how tend to pursue zero-Covid goals in a more aggressive and extensive manner, Huang said.\n\n‘It’s simply not working’\n\nThe repeating cycle of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing is taking a heavy toll on the economy and society. Public patience is wearing thin, and frustrations are building.\n\nOn Monday in Baoding city, Hebei province, a father wielding a knife drove through a Covid checkpoint in a desperate bid to buy milk powder for his son. Video footage of the scene and his subsequent arrest sparked uproar online; the following day local police tried to soothe tempers by saying the man had been fined only 100 yuan ($13.75) and that his child’s “milk powder problem” had been “properly resolved.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the death of a 3-year-old in Lanzhou, Gansu province, sparked another outcry, after the child’s family said lockdown measures had delayed emergency responders. Police said later the child had stopped breathing by the time officers arrived, but did not address the family’s accusations that an ambulance had been delayed. CNN has reached out to Lanzhou authorities for comment.\n\nIn another sign of how sensitive the issue has become, Chinese stocks rallied on Wednesday following unverified social media rumors that China was forming a committee to prepare an exit from the zero-Covid policy.\n\nThose rumors were quashed, however, when the Foreign Ministry said it was “unaware” of any such plan.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say they see no signs of the Chinese government taking steps that would suggest it is rethinking its approach.\n\nChinese health officials maintain that changing tack now would risk a huge surge in infections and deaths that could overwhelm the country’s fragile health care system.\n\nBeijing has so far refused to approve for use the mRNA vaccines developed in Western countries, which have been shown to be more potent than those made and used in China. Experts say China also lacks an emergency response plan to cope with surging infections.\n\nBut Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said such catastrophic scenarios could be avoided with proper preparation.\n\nInstead of spending vast amounts of time and resources on testing, contact tracing, quarantining and imposing lockdowns, authorities should introduce more effective vaccines and antiviral therapies and boost the vaccination rate among the elderly, Jin said.\n\nWith boosted immunity, asymptomatic or mild cases could be allowed to recover at home – freeing up space at hospitals to treat more severe cases, he said.\n\n“Using lockdown and containment measures to deal with an infectious disease with such a low mortality rate and high transmissibility is no longer appropriate. The whole world has abandoned this approach – nobody can stand the cost, it’s simply not working,” he said.\n\nFear of the virus\n\nAnother hurdle to pivoting from zero-Covid is a pervasive fear of the virus among large swaths of the public, instilled by the Chinese government to justify its harsh control measures, experts say.\n\n“Authorities have demonized Covid, exaggerating its severity and mortality rate and talking up long-Covid symptoms. Many ordinary people are still very afraid of the virus, with recovered Covid patients suffering from severe discrimination and stigmatization,” Jin said.\n\nIt was partly such fears that drove thousands of migrant workers to flee in panic from the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, he said.\n\nVideos of people traveling on foot, dragging their luggage on roads and across fields, went viral on Chinese social media over the weekend. Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million, imposed sweeping lockdown measures last month after identifying dozens of Covid-19 cases.\n\nThe Foxconn facility has been racing to control an outbreak since mid-October, though the company has not disclosed the number of infections among its workers. On Wednesday, the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where the Foxconn plant is located, announced new lockdown measures.\n\nAs the Foxconn exodus thrust the Zhengzhou outbreak into the spotlight, the city’s health authorities have tried to allay public fears. On Monday, the Zhengzhou municipal health commission published a WeChat article with the headline: “Covid is not that horrible, but preventable and treatable.”\n\nHuang, the expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said misconceptions about the virus would complicate matters if China did at some point decide to move away from zero Covid.\n\n“Even if in the future, China wants to change the narrative and play down the seriousness of the disease, some people might not buy into the new narrative,” he said.\n\nAs the winter approaches, experts warn that China could be hit by a new wave of infections – and a new cycle of draconian lockdowns.\n\nChina reported 2,755 local infections for Tuesday, the highest daily tally since August.\n\n“Judging from the situation in China, there will be a major outbreak sooner or later. China has deployed tremendous efforts and paid a heavy cost to prevent that from happening, but in the end, it won’t be able to stop such a highly infectious disease from spreading,” Jin said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022. Jeffrey T.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York. The city of Buffalo contracts with the provider for ambulance services, an Erie County spokesperson told CNN.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/02/20/turkey-earthquake-live-updates/11305805002/", "title": "Turkey earthquake live updates: Second quake hits shattered region", "text": "A 6.3 magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey’s Hatay province Monday, two weeks after the region was devastated by massive temblors and a series of strong aftershocks, injuring or trapping people inside already-damaged buildings.\n\nTurkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said three people were killed and 213 injured.

It was followed by a second tremor of magnitude 5.8. Reuters reported that Monday's temblor set off panic and damaged buildings in the city of Antakya.\n\nHatay province is on the Mediterranean coast, bordered by Syria to the south and east. The province was slammed by the Feb. 6 quakes that Turkish officials say killed more than 41,000 people in their country alone. Several thousand people also died in Syria as a result of the quakes, which injured tens of thousands of people across the two nations and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\n\nUS PROVIDES AID: Secretary of State Blinken toured Turkey’s earthquake zone, pledged $100M in aid\n\nDisaster struck the region Feb. 6\n\nOn Feb. 6, a magnitude 7.8 quake struck southern Turkey, U.S. Geological Survey said.

Despite the rare, inspiring rescues, thousands of bodies were being removed from toppled buildings, and experts said the chances of finding survivors are increasingly slim. Two weeks later, many people remain in the streets without shelter.\n\nAftershocks collapse damaged buildings\n\nBecause so many people are seeking shelter in temperatures that are still dropping below freezing some nights, they appear willing to risk entering what appear to be undamaged buildings.\n\nBut those buildings may have been damaged by the initial quakes and were poised to collapse when this strong new aftershock occurred, California-based structural engineer Andy Thompson said.\n\n\"It's an extremely challenging situation made much worse by the continuous aftershocks and the concern of damaged buildings being pushed to the point of collapse,\" said Thompson, who has responded to quakes in Haiti, Chile and India. \"You might have an undamaged home that's in the shadow of a building that's about to collapse.\"\n\nThompson, the CEO of quake-assessment company SafeHub, said quickly assessing the damage levels of buildings is a tough task, complicated by ongoing rescues, shortages of heavy equipment and safety concerns from aftershocks.\n\n\"In these situations, we would never say that a building is safe. The thing that structural engineers would be saying, what we're looking at, is the question: 'Is it less safe than it was before the primary event?'\" he said. \"The challenge is that you need to make thousands of evaluations very quickly with a limited number of experts.\"\n\nDesperate survivors taking risks\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Andrew Cote, who recently returned from the Hatay area following a four-day search-and-rescue trip, said many buildings still standing were nevertheless teetering on the edge.\n\nIn one case, he said, two approximately six-story apartment buildings had teetered sideways into each other, posing significant risk of further collapse. In many other places, he said, the first floors of buildings collapsed but the rest of the building remained standing, sometimes with an exterior wall missing.\n\nHe said even without quakes, pieces of buildings were still falling off nearly two weeks after the initial quake. But with nowhere else to go, people are camping outside their former homes or sleeping in cars to stay warm in temperatures that are still falling below freezing some nights.\n\n\"My immediate thought is the few buildings that were still vertical have now come down, exponentially increasing the search area,\" he said Monday, reflecting on the new quake.\n\nCote works for BRINC Drones, which makes tactical drones with two-way video and audio capability. In Hatay, they used the drones to fly up several stories, break a window and then fly down hallways and through rooms to search, keeping rescuers outside until it was deemed safe or necessary to enter.\n\nCote said many international teams had sophisticated thermal cameras or acoustic sensors, but most of the searching is being done by hand by desperate residents searching for family members and friends.\n\n\"I saw people without shoes climbing around – it was so emotionally driven, with safety as an afterthought,\" he said. \"They were in it with their hands, with fence posts that they turned into crowbars.\"\n\nNew damage worsens existing humanitarian disaster\n\nAuthorities are warning the disaster areas could be hit by a cholera epidemic, compounding the already dire risks facing displaced residents.\n\nMany people are living in temporary shelters with poor access to hygiene, which raises concerns for the spread of infectious diseases. Syria was already facing a cholera outbreak, and a vaccination campaign to curb its spread was halted by the quake.\n\nAdditionally, millions are now living without permanent shelter or access to preventative medicine or treatment for ongoing disease like diabetes, because resources are focused on acute and disaster care.\n\n\"Restoring access to essential health and water services is crucial to prevent outbreaks and save lives,\" said Eli, the spokesperson for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\nHow to help Turkey, Syria:Relief efforts ongoing after more earthquakes rock region\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/business/china-covid-return-to-work-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China wants Covid patients to go to work.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nJust weeks ago, catching Covid in China meant being taken to government quarantine for an indeterminate stay and your entire residential building being locked down, trapping neighbors in their homes for days or weeks.\n\nNow, as the country rapidly relaxes restrictions, millions of people have been told to keep going to work — even if they’re infected.\n\nThe cities of Wuhu, Chongqing and Guiyang, and the province of Zhejiang, collectively home to more than 100 million people, all recently issued directives to public sector employees indicating a shift from preventing infection to allowing the resumption of life and work.\n\nAsymptomatic and mildly ill workers can “go to work normally after taking protective measures as necessary for their health status and job requirements,” said the Chongqing and Wuhu authorities in similar statements posted on their municipal government websites.\n\nZhejiang provincial and health leaders gave similar instructions at a news conference Sunday, with one official suggesting key teams consider a rotation schedule “to ensure uninterrupted work and maintain order when outbreaks are severe.” Guiyang followed suit on Tuesday, according to state media.\n\nThe push to return to work comes as China relaxes rules around testing, quarantine and other pandemic policies, in a dramatic step away from its costly zero-Covid policy.\n\nFor three years, its stringent approach has kept Covid cases and deaths relatively low in the country. But it has also wreaked havoc on the economy and people’s mental health.\n\nAn incessant cycle of outbreaks and lockdowns has coincided with record youth unemployment, disruptions to supply chains and a cratering of the real estate sector that accounts for about 30% of China’s GDP.\n\nMeanwhile, scenes of chaos emerged from mass lockdowns in cities like Shanghai, with residents reportedly unable to access food, basic supplies and even emergency medical care — sowing deep resentment toward the authorities and, in November, a wave of rare public protest.\n\nCovid control workers walk by a closed shop near a community with residents under health monitoring for Covid on December 4 in Beijing.

But the abrupt U-turn was seemingly carried out with little advance warning or preparation, causing a sense of whiplash and confusion among many.\n\n“A few months ago if you went out like this, you would be sentenced,” one person commented on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, under the back-to-work announcement.\n\nBonnie Wang, a fintech worker in Zhejiang’s industrial hub of Ningbo, told CNN that a colleague with Covid symptoms continued to work in the office this week with a fever.\n\n“I hope when we encounter situations like this, our health will still come first, and work comes second,” she said.\n\nShift in priorities\n\nDuring the pandemic, local governments essentially had a “get-out-of-jail-free card” on their economic performance, said Ryan Manuel, founder of Bilby, a Hong Kong-based company that uses artificial intelligence to analyze Chinese policy.\n\n“Your adherence to the central Covid policy is what mattered,” he said. “Economic growth numbers, all these different things you’re measured on, they’re reduced to — ‘We don’t have a Covid outbreak, everything’s OK.’”\n\nBut, he added, the central government’s approach has changed to: “We’re not going to give you that leeway … we’re going to judge you on growth again.”\n\nThis shift in priority is clearly reflected in the government’s messaging, with Chinese experts and state media downplaying the severity of Omicron and instead emphasizing the importance of economic recovery.\n\nTop leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference, a key annual meeting that ended Friday, said in a statement that stabilizing economic growth was the top priority for 2023. They also signaled that policymakers would relax their grip on the country’s private sector — a departure from the regulatory crackdown that in recent years has thrown China’s biggest private companies into chaos.\n\nAnd though the economy has been struggling for several years, Manuel said China’s leaders may now feel more secure in adjusting their policy after the closely-watched Communist Party Congress in October.\n\nOfficials nationwide had worked frantically to contain Covid cases ahead of the highly sensitive twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle, which saw Chinese leader Xi Jinping emerge more powerful than ever into his third term.\n\n“You’re not going to take a risk before the Party Congress,” Manuel said. “But once the Party Congress ends, you don’t have that restraint.”\n\nAs cases rise, so does fear\n\nBut this push for economic growth comes at a cost, one already making itself clear as cases skyrocket across the country, with widespread medicine shortages and reports of crematoriums struggling to keep up.\n\nUnder the current conditions, a nationwide reopening could result in nearly a million deaths, according to a CNN calculation based on a study released last week by professors at the University of Hong Kong. The paper, which has yet to undergo peer review, added that the surge in infections would “likely overload many local health systems across the country.”\n\nIt’s difficult to gauge the extent of the virus’ spread, given the rapid shift from mandatory testing to self-testing at home. Complicating matters is the fact that many restrictions and rules around returning to work diverge at the local level.\n\nBeds in partitioned rooms at a makeshift fever clinic, converted from a stadium, in Beijing, on December 20. Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWang, the worker in Ningbo, told CNN that a former colleague didn’t receive any support from his superiors after falling sick recently.\n\n“Do you know what’s the first thing the company sent him? It was his work laptop. It’s outrageous,” she said, adding that though she understood the need for business to continue, “maybe because I am a worker, I empathize most with the workers.”\n\nAs fears spread over the looming wave of cases, subway systems and streets have emptied in recent weeks, which is unusual for this time of year, given China does not celebrate Christmas and most businesses are still open.\n\nThe capital Beijing, now experiencing its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic, saw only 2.21 million subway passengers on Monday, the metro said in a post online — more than 58% lower than the average daily weekday ridership from early October to early December. Similar drops were reported in other major cities, including Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nThis sense of anxiety was reflected online, with many people reacting with alarm to the new directives.\n\n“I feel that the local government that introduced this policy is extremely irresponsible,” read a top post on Weibo, where a related hashtag was viewed more than 240 million times on Tuesday. “Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients can still be contagious … and many people have elderly relatives and children at home.”\n\nSome took a more cynical tone, criticizing the decision as prioritizing the economy at the expense of workers’ wellbeing, and demanding that their superiors be held to the same expectation.\n\n“In other words, if you get sick, you will either need to ask for leave and deduct your wages, or continue to work,” one Weibo user wrote.\n\nAnother remarked: “It sounds like placing money over life.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Cheng Cheng", "Jessie Yeung", "Cheng Cheng"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/us/arizona-grand-canyon-caverns-tourists-trapped/index.html", "title": "Tourists stranded underground at Arizona's Grand Canyon Caverns ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe tourists who had become stuck about 200 feet underground at the Grand Canyon Caverns in Peach Springs, Arizona, on Sunday when an elevator malfunctioned have all been brought back to the surface with the help of local fire departments.\n\nSix people had become stranded at the tourist site after an elevator stopped working around noon on Sunday, including a family of four with two young children, and a second couple, according to Seligman Fire Chief Gary Bennett.\n\nFirefighters with the Seligman Fire District were able to help the family of four up the approximately 21 flights of stairs to the surface between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Sunday evening.\n\nAccording to Bennett, the husband of the second couple was also able to take the stairs to the surface, but decided to return to the cavern to stay with his wife at the motel suite located at the bottom of the caverns on Sunday night until the elevator became operational again.\n\nThat couple took the elevator back to the surface on Monday.\n\nDouglas Grashel and his stepdaughter Sherry Jimenez told CNN on Tuesday night that they were stuck underground for more than 30 hours before they were able exit the site.\n\nGrashel said he learned the elevator malfunctioned around 11:30 a.m. Sunday after his group did a short tour.\n\n“And by that time, you could smell the smoke in the elevator shaft and see the smoke coming down into the cavern,” Grashel told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on Tuesday night.\n\nGrashel was also trapped with his wife, a toddler and a baby – so the family wasn’t physically able to use the emergency staircase ladder, which was more than 20 flights long.\n\nJimenez described the stairs as having “a steel plank that was smaller than the size of a regular ladder,” with inadequate handrail protection. “There was no measure of protection from the stair to the top of the handrail,” she said of the emergency stairs.\n\n“There was no way in the world that we were going to be able to make it up,” Grashel said. “I’ve got back surgery scheduled.

But will it be a place where real action can be taken on addressing climate change, or will it be a distressing example of international greenwashing that makes little serious progress?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask. President Joe Biden will be attending what's known as COP27 for at least a day. The White House says he'll \"build on the significant work the United States has undertaken to advance the global climate fight.\"\n\nBut Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg counts herself among the gathering's critics. Speaking in London at the release of her book, \"The Climate Book,\" the 19-year-old who has gained global fame in the fight against climate change said the meetings are mostly a chance for \"leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing.\"\n\nAHEAD OF THE SUMMIT:Flurry of climate change reports have ominous message\n\nWATCH:Climate questions — Who is most vulnerable?\n\nHere's what to know about COP27:\n\nWhat is COP27?\n\nCOP27 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 countries that have agreed to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, originally adopted in 1992. The meeting is the decision-making body of the countries that signed onto the framework. It is held to assess how well nations are dealing with climate change.\n\nWhat are the dates of COP27?\n\nThe U.N. Climate Change Conference runs Sunday to Nov. 18.\n\nWhere is COP27 being held?\n\nIt's being held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. It is known for its sandy beaches and coral reefs and is a major tourist destination for divers. It's pronounced Sharm-el-shake.\n\nWhat does COP27 stand for?\n\nCOP is short for \"Conference of the Parties,\" because it is a conference of the parties or countries that signed the agreement. This is the 27th meeting of all the signatories. The first was in 1995 in Berlin. The numbering is slightly off because COP 26 was postponed for a year because of COVID-19. It's pronounced cop (as in police) 27.\n\nIs COP27 necessary?\n\nBefore the industrial revolution, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million. CO2 traps the sun's heat, warming the plant. This year's measurement is 419 parts per million, a number not seen since the Pliocene Epoch 4.1 to 4.5 million years ago. At that time, the sea level was about 78 feet higher than today, the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in pre-industrial times, and studies indicate large forests occupied areas of the Arctic that are now tundra, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nCritics have said the entire process of annual meetings and small, incremental and sometimes bureaucratic change is too little, too late. Speaking in London on Sunday, Thunberg said rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented change is needed to deal with global warming.\n\nCOP27 has also been criticized for allowing Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest plastic producers, to be a major sponsor of the event. The company has responded that it is prepared to do its part to fight against climate change.\n\nIs this year's COP especially important?\n\nThose attending would tell you every COP is important.\n\nBut next year's should get even more attention. It will be the first time the nations that signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 (at COP21) will tell the world how well they've implemented their climate plans and identify what still needs to be done. It is being called the Global Stocktake and will be presented at COP28 in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHEALTH:How climate change is hurting Americans’ health – and what experts suggest we do about it\n\nELECTION:Climate change on ballot in midterms, Boris Johnson drops his return bid: 5 Things podcast\n\nWhat's expected to happen in Egypt?\n\nThis year countries are supposed to deliver updated plans on how they're going to lower their greenhouse gas emissions, something they agreed to do at last year's COP in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nOnly 23 out of 193 countries have submitted their plans to the U.N.\n\nBecause this COP is being held in Africa, it's expected to include more focus on African issues. This is not the first COP to be held in Africa, however. The 2001 and 2016 meetings were in Morocco, 2006 in Kenya and 2011 in South Africa.\n\nWhat is 'loss and damage' financing, and what does it have to do with COP27?\n\nCOP27 is also supposed to take on \"loss and damage\" financing. That's the controversial question of how poor and vulnerable nations dealing with climate change might be compensated by wealthy countries.\n\nDeveloping countries are demanding some type of global compensation or aid fund, saying their people are living with – and dying from – climate change caused by more developed nations that got wealthy by burning fossil fuels.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nMore than 35,000 people from around the world are expected to be in Egypt at the meeting, from official government delegations to climate activists who are will be corralled into a separate designated protest area away from the conference center. Protests are severely restricted in Egypt.\n\nBiden is expected to attend for at least a day.

Given countries’ current promises, Earth’s temperature will climb to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nUltimately, the world needs to cut its fossil fuel emissions nearly in half by 2030 to avoid 1.5 degrees, a daunting prospect for economies still very much beholden to oil, natural gas and coal.\n\n“No country has a right to be delinquent,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry told reporters in October. “The scientists tell us that what is happening now – the increased extreme heat, extreme weather, the fires, the floods, the warming of the ocean, the melting of the ice, the extraordinary way in which life is being affected badly by the climate crisis – is going to get worse unless we address this crisis in a unified, forward-leaning way.”\n\nHere are the top issues to follow at COP27 in Egypt.\n\nA fight over ‘loss and damage’\n\nPeople in Pakistan take refuge from flooding in a makeshift camp on August 31 in the Jaffarabad district of Balochistan province. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDeveloping and developed countries have for years tussled over the concept of a “loss and damage” fund; the idea which suggests countries causing the most harm with their outrageous planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries, which have suffered from the resulting climate disasters.\n\nIt has been a thorny issue because the richest countries, including the US, don’t want to appear culpable or legally liable to other nations for harm. Kerry, for instance, has tiptoed around the issue, saying the US supports formal talks, but he has not given any indication of what solution the country would sign on to.\n\nMeanwhile, small island nations and others in the Global South are shouldering the impact of the climate crisis, as devastating floods, intensifying storms and record-breaking heat waves wreak havoc.\n\nThe deadly flooding in Pakistan this summer, which killed more than 1,500 people, will surely be an example the countries’ negotiators point to. And since September, more than two million people in Nigeria have been affected by the worst flooding there in a decade. At this very moment, Nigerians are drinking, cooking with and bathing in dirty flood water amid serious concerns over waterborne diseases.\n\nLoss and damage will have space on the official COP27 agenda this year. But beyond countries committing to meet and talk about what a potential loss and damage fund would look like, or whether one should even exist, it is unclear what action will come out of this year’s summit.\n\n“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt’s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr recently told reporters.\n\nFormer White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN she thinks loss and damage will be the top issue at the UN climate summit this year, and said nations including the US will face some tough questions about their plans to help developing nations already being hit hard by climate disasters.\n\n“It just keeps getting pushed out,” McCarthy said. “There’s need for some real accountability and some specific commitments in the short-term.”\n\nA tense US-China relationship\n\nXi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, left, and John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. Getty Images/AP\n\nPeople will be watching to see if the US and China can repair a broken relationship at the summit, a year after the two countries surprised the world by announcing they would work together on climate change.\n\nThe newfound cooperation came crashing down this summer when China announced it was suspending climate talks with the US as part of broader retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.\n\nKerry recently said the climate talks between the two countries are still suspended and will likely remain so until China’s president Xi Jinping gives the green light. Kerry and others are watching to see whether China fulfills the promise it made last year to submit a plan to bring down its methane emissions or updates its emissions pledge.\n\nThe US and China are the world’s two largest emitters and their cooperation matters, particularly because it can spur other countries to act, too.\n\nCan the world raise enough money?\n\nThis year's UN climate summit is being held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, where thousands of climate negotiators and advocates will gather to raise their ambitions on the climate crisis. Mohamed el-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeparate from a potential loss and damage fund, there is the overarching issue of so-called global climate finance; a fund rich countries promised to push money into to help the developing world transition to clean energy rather than grow their economies with fossil fuels.\n\nThe promise made in 2009 was $100 billion per year, but the world has yet to meet the pledge. Some of the richest countries, including the US, UK, Canada and others, have consistently fallen short of their allocation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised the US would contribute $11 billion by 2024 toward the effort. But Biden’s request is ultimately up to Congress to approve, and will likely go nowhere if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nThe US is working on separate deals with countries including Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia to get them to move away from coal and toward renewables. And US officials often stress they want to also unlock private investments to help countries transition to renewables and deal with climate effects.\n\nCountries are straight up off-track\n\nShips carry coal outside a coal-fired power plant in November 2021 in Hanchuan, Hubei province, China. Getty Images\n\nCOP27 is intended to hold countries’ feet to the fire on fossil fuel emissions and gin up new ambition on the climate crisis. Yet reports show we are still off-track to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nA UN report which surveyed countries’ latest pledges found the planet will warm between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.\n\nRecords were set last year for all three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThere is a spot of encouraging news: the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles is surging and helping to offset the rise in fossil fuel emissions, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.\n\nBut the overall picture from the reports shows there is a need for much more clean energy, deployed swiftly. Every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise will have stark consequences, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.\n\n“The energy transition is entirely doable, but we’re not on that pathway, and we have procrastinated and wasted time,” Andersen told CNN. “Every digit will matter. Let’s not say ‘we missed 1.5 so let’s settle for 2.’ No. We must understand that every digit that goes up will make our life and the life of our children and grandchildren much more impacted.”\n\nThe clock is ticking in another way: Next year’s COP28 in Dubai will be the year nations must do an official stocktake to determine if the world is on track to meet the goals set out in the landmark Paris Agreement.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/30/cop28-and-climate-change-temperature-threshold/71729217007/", "title": "COP28 will debate critical climate change temperature threshold", "text": "Consider that 3 degrees Fahrenheit is the difference between a raging fever and a healthy toddler. Between a hockey rink and a swimming pool. Between food going bad or staying at a safe temperature.\n\nNow consider that Earth is about 2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter on average than it was in the 1800s. It's little wonder that has already led to measurable shifts in the climate: The last eight years have been the hottest in recorded history and 2023 is expected to be the hottest yet.\n\nBut there's a looming threshold that will dictate the future of planet Earth. It could have cascading effects on how hot the planet gets, how much seas rise and how significantly normal daily life as we now know it will change.\n\nThe number is 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWorld leaders at an annual gathering beginning Thursday will be spending considerable energy pondering that number, although they will use the Celsius version: 1.5 degrees.\n\n“We can still make a big difference and every single tenth of a degree is enormously important,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\nRepresentatives and negotiators from 197 nations are gathering at an event called COP (Conference of the Parties) in the United Arab Emirates, a 13-day meeting that comes at what scientists say is a critical moment in the fight to keep the already dangerous effects of climate change from tipping over into the catastrophic.\n\nResearch published last month estimated humanity has only six or so more years before so much carbon dioxide has been pumped into the atmosphere that there's only a 50% chance of staying below the threshold.\n\nWhy 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit is so important\n\nIn 2016, the United States and 195 other parties signed the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change aimed at lowering the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to keep global warming at bay.\n\nAll the nations that signed the Agreement pledged to try as hard as possible to keep the global average temperature increase below 2.7 degrees, and to definitely keep it below a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit rise. (Only the Agreement said it in Celsius, which comes out to the smoother-sounding 2.0 degrees Celsius and 1.5 degrees Celsius.)\n\nThe numbers sound pretty small – but they aren't.\n\nA few degrees is a big deal\n\nThe difference between 65 degrees and 67.7 degrees (that critical 2.7-degree difference) isn't even worth carrying a sweater. So why does it worry climate scientists?\n\nIt's because they're thinking about global temperature averages, and when the global average goes up, the extremes go way up.\n\nThe Earth is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the 1800s, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. And it's warming fast.\n\nOcean surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded this year, causing fish die-offs and increasing red tides.\n\nPeople across America are already noticing the effects. Storms are more extreme, drenching areas with more water that's causing an increasing number of devastating flash floods. Dozens of people in Vermont, Tennessee and Pennsylvania are only the most recent victims.\n\nThese aren't just normal storms, these are deluges where four months of rain falls in one day.\n\nWe're also experiencing more devastating droughts catastrophic wildfires and wetter hurricanes.\n\nWhy is it important to not let the Earth warm an extra degree?\n\nThe difference between an aspiration of no more than 2.7 degrees warming and a serious commitment to no more than 3.6 degrees might not seem large.\n\nBut multiply the extremes and their effects, and each results in a vastly different world. One is difficult, resulting in a less reliable and more chaotic climate than the one we live with today. The other verges on a movie cataclysm.\n\nAt their heart, the 13 days of COP28 negotiations are the place global governments sit down to hammer out just how much each will lower its carbon emissions, though many other climate change topics are on the table as well.\n\nUsing published research and reports from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Carbon Brief laid out the likely measurable difference between a world that is 2.7 degrees warmer and one that is 3.6 degrees warmer:\n\n◾ Sea level rise by 2100 of 18 inches vs. 22 inches\n\n◾ Ice-free Arctic summer chance of 10% vs. 80%\n\n◾ Central U.S. warm spells last 10 days vs. 21 days\n\n◾ Percentage of people facing at least one severe heat wave in five years is 14% vs. 37%\n\nWhy is this all about fossil fuels?\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – which is what's causing global warming – was 280 parts per million.\n\nThe current measurement is 421.47 parts per million.\n\nThe change has been underway for decades, but the extent of the shift is only now becoming clearly evident. In the 1980s, the country experienced on average a $1 billion, adjusted for inflation, disaster every four months. It now experiences one every three weeks. This year, the country has set a new record with 25 billion-dollar disasters.\n\nThe Earth crossed a key warming threshold in 2023, with one-third of the days so far having an average temperature at least 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than preindustrial levels. On Nov. 17, it reached 2.07 degrees above. This year is expected to be the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years.\n\nWhat is COP28?\n\nCOP28 is the annual United Nations meeting of the 197 parties that have agreed to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, originally adopted in 1992. The meeting is the decision-making body of the countries that signed onto the U.N. framework. It is held to assess how well nations are dealing with climate change and set agendas and goals.\n\nHow important is this COP?\n\nIn a major report, the UN’s climate change body said earlier this month that global greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 levels to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThings are not going in the right direction. Instead, emissions are set to rise by 9%.\n\nCOP28 is where changes can be made.\n\nScientists say humanity has about a decade to dramatically reduce heat-trapping gas emissions before thresholds are passed that may make recovery from climate collapse impossible.\n\nTo do so will require cutting nearly two-thirds of carbon pollution by 2035, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. That means ending new fossil fuel exploration and weaning wealthy nations away from coal, oil and gas by 2040.\n\n“Humanity is on thin ice – and that ice is melting fast,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the spring. “Our world needs climate action on all fronts – everything, everywhere, all at once.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/special/contributor-content/2023/08/10/kblgs-hessam-kalantar-the-uae-is-the-perfect-venue-for-cop28/70569158007/", "title": "KBLG's Hessam Kalantar: The UAE is the “Perfect” Venue for COP28", "text": "Kristen Lynch\n\nContributor\n\nThe decision to hold the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, in Dubai, UAE has been met with scrutiny, mostly from Western organizations, including criticism that the conference will be held in one of the world's largest oil-producing countries and will be headed by Sultan Al-Jaber, CEO of UAE state-owned oil company ADNOC. Certain of these organizations allege that Al-Jaber's roles as president-designate of COP28 and oil executive present a conflict of interest and portray it as the fossil fuel industry's hijacking of the UN's climate talks.\n\nHowever, Hessam Kalantar, founder and managing partner of Kalantar Business Law Group (KBLG), a boutique Abu Dhabi corporate law firm, says that Dubai is a strategically sensible host for COP28, and that most of this type of criticism is suggestive of “virtue signaling” by western powers. For one thing, COP events have in the past been hosted by hydrocarbon producing countries. Moreover, fossil fuel companies were formerly excluded from intergovernmental climate discussions, which Kalantar believes was counterproductive. Oil, coal and natural gas have, after all, been powering economies for over 150 years, and currently supply about 80% of the world’s energy. This statistic must change, and quickly, but that requires big oil to be enticed to meaningfully engage, and become the “energy transition” enablers that they are already (and sometimes too hastily) calling themselves.\n\n“We need to be realistic – we can't just switch off the oil taps overnight. The oil producers need to be part of this conversation. While they may have been a big part of the problem, they are also very much part of the solution,” Kalantar says. “The oil companies are needed to fund the innovation necessary to develop alternative energy sources at scale. This is especially important for developing countries, which, unlike developed countries, have not had the time or the funding to industrialize while simultaneously exploring the use of low carbon fuels.”\n\nDespite being a major oil-producing nation, the UAE has made significant strides towards sustainable energy. Masdar is a state-owned renewable energy company, also chaired by al-Jaber, that was established in 2006, predating many other countries’ renewable initiatives.\n\nDubai is also located strategically, as it is a bridge between East/West and North/South, not just physically, but also culturally and symbolically. The UAE has vibrant ties with various countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and, according to Kalantar, these ties are conducive to fostering conversations where all stakeholders have a seat at the table and the right to be heard.\n\nFurthermore, the Middle East today has a louder voice than ever before, in part because it is attracting larger inflows of investment and encouraging the adoption of a knowledge based economy focused on technology and services such as education and healthcare. Kalantar adds that the Middle East has the ability to host important global events that make their mark on history, including recently Expo 2020 in Dubai and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nAccording to scientists, the Middle East is one of the global regions that will be disproportionately impacted by climate change. The already high temperatures are rising and the region faces the constant threat of desertification and water deficiency.\n\nKalantar adds that COP28 will bring an inflow of intergovernmental climate expertise to the UAE. However, the concern is that, as with many conferences of this sort, all the talk, interest, and enthusiasm may fade away after COP28 is over and the delegates and experts have returned home. Thus, he believes it is important to cultivate that know-how locally, and ensure that there will be a repository of expertise to help deploy climate solutions that are customized for the geography and conditions of the Gulf nations.\n\nAs part of COP28, the UN will publish the first two-year assessment of global progress to slow down climate change, also known as the global stocktake. The world is set to fail to achieve the benchmarks set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, and Al-Jaber has urged nations to admit their failures in meeting the climate agenda.\n\nAmong KBLG’s goals is to support transactions whereby private sector involvement in climate solutions is incentivized and rewarded by government, because governments alone cannot solve these problems. KBLG is advising on sustainable finance transactions, and the firm is very keen to expand this competence and become advocates for local sustainable frameworks and climate regulation.\n\n“The emergency that is the climate crisis has instilled a sense of purpose in us as both lawyers and citizens. We are not alone in this passion and we owe it largely to the significant strides that are now being taken in our own part of the world, particularly the UAE, to pass regulations, such as Abu Dhabi Global Market’s recently enacted sustainable finance framework, and to fund innovations such as green hydrogen,” said Kalantar.\n\nWith all that is already underway in the UAE to battle climate change, it does seem that the UAE, including its energy producers, are well placed to lead the dialogue at COP28.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/westpb/2023/11/30/west-palm-beach-mayor-to-attend-cop28-climate-change-conference-in-dubai/71729568007/", "title": "West Palm Beach mayor to attend COP28 climate change ...", "text": "West Palm Beach Mayor Keith James is scheduled to participate in an international climate change conference in Dubai, his second international trip in as many years.\n\nJames traveled to Israel in 2022 as part of a delegation of U.S. mayors invited to the Middle East by the American Jewish Committee's Project Interchange.\n\nDubai's COP28 conference — the 28th \"conference of the parties\" summit held since 150 governments signed a United Nations climate change agreement in 1992 — is scheduled to run from Nov. 30 through Dec. 12 at Expo City Dubai, an exhibition and trade center in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nJames left for Dubai on Wednesday and is scheduled to return on Dec. 7.\n\nInternational climate change conferences are often attended by national government representatives, despite the fact that agreed upon goals often require buy-in, ordinance and policy changes from local governments. James will be part of a large contingent of U.S. mayors participating in COP28.\n\n“Cities are at the forefront of climate impacts and solutions,” James said.\n\nAt the close of Monday's City Commission meeting, James said he'll be \"taking the story of West Palm Beach, what we have been doing in our climate change and sustainability journey, and certainly listening with open ears to hear about best practices that other communities are doing.\"\n\nIn announcing James' plan to participate in COP28, the city noted some of its climate change accomplishments, including:\n\n-An \"A\" rating from a group that analyzes how transparent governments and businesses are in disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n-A municipal Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design or LEED certification.\n\n-A goal of having its greenhouse gas emissions at net zero by 2050.\n\n-A sustainability and climate change resiliency action plan.\n\n-Updates to an assessment on the city's vulnerability to climate change.\n\nAl Gore, other activists already criticizing CEO of oil company heading up the conference\n\nCOP28 is being hosted this year by Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization that oversees donations made by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nThe conference has gotten off to something of a rocky start. The BBC and other media outlets have reported that Al-Jaber planned to use the conference as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals. And some climate change activists, including former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, criticized the decision to have the leader of one of the largest oil companies in the world serve as a co-host of an international climate change conference.\n\n\"The chances for real progress at COP28 were badly damaged early this year when an oil company CEO was appointed to lead the negotiations,\" Gore said in response to the BBC's report, according to CBS News. \"And now investigative journalists have confirmed some of the worst fears of those who criticized that absurd appointment with the shocking news that the President-designate has been using the meetings he has set up with nations around the world to sell more oil and gas. Using international climate talks as leverage to shore up support for pumping more oil and gas at a time when we urgently need to phase out fossil fuels is — to say the least — utterly appalling.\"\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies is covering the cost of James' travel to and accommodations in Dubai, according to a statement released by the city of West Palm Beach.\n\nJames endorsed Bloomberg during the former mayor's brief run for president in 2020. Bloomberg is covering travel costs for James and 44 other U.S. mayors, James said.\n\nMayor Keith James' wife is also going to Dubai but 'on her own dime'\n\nKeith James' wife, Lorna James, is joining her husband on the trip, though he wryly noted that she won't be seated next to him on the roughly 14-hour flight to Dubai.\n\n\"I'm stating publicly my wife will be going on her own dime,\" the mayor said. \"I can say honestly my wife will not be flying business class because that is a $17,000 ticket. I'm just a mayor. I'm on a fixed income.\"\n\nSmiling, the mayor, whose annual salary is $150,000, added: \"We found her a lower-priced ticket. I'll be up in the front. She'll be back there. But she's willing to do this.\"\n\nThat could be because Lorna James, managing director for an IT consulting firm, has an ulterior motive.\n\n\"She is insisting that we ride camels when we are in Dubai,\" the mayor said. \"I am ... resisting that effort. The true test of my marriage will be whether there are pictures of me riding a camel when I return.

Here's what to know.", "text": "As the world nears the end of what could be the hottest year in recorded history and heads into one predicted to be hotter still, a report underscores the health consequences of the warming climate.\n\nThe 8th annual report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, released Tuesday, describes a \"grave and mounting threat\" if we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially given the evidence of worsening world health as the planet warms.\n\nIt outlines many ways this warming trend is already impacting the health of Americans. They include heat waves that stress young and old bodies and threaten to overwhelm hospitals; droughts and floods that endanger the food supply; the spread of disease to new areas, the extension and altered timing of allergy seasons; increases in air pollution and the growing scale of lethal fires.\n\n\"As we see temperatures continuing to rise and wildfires continuing to get worse, we're just seeing these really stark increases in impacts to health,\" said Naomi Beyeler, the lead author of the U.S. section of the report.\n\nIt's not too late to change the trajectory of global climate change, she and other experts say. But the world is getting close to the precipice.\n\n\"We have the tools at hand. We have the money at hand. We can do this,\" said Dr. Kari Nadeau, chair of the Department of Environmental Health at the T.H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health. Nadeau was not involved in the Lancet report, but praised its analysis and priorities. \"It's really a matter of the political will.\"\n\nNadeau said she doesn't want to be a purveyor of doom, but climate change and its health impacts are no longer something coming in the future, it's something that is happening now.\n\n\"I hope people realize it's going to affect them, their children, their grandchildren and their friends,\" she said.\n\nThere is room for hope, and for improving public health if countries take action, according to Beyeler, of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nThe Lancet report is one of several arriving ahead of COP 28, a meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that begins Nov. 30 in Dubai.\n\nCountries that committed to the Paris Agreement have pledged to try to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial times.\n\nThat goal is still achievable, but only if governments, companies and banks stop \"negligent\" investments in oil and gas, according to the Lancet report. \"Without profound and swift mitigation to tackle the root causes of climate change, the health of humanity is at grave risk,\" it says.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the White House released the nation's Fifth National Climate Assessment and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change released an analysis of the climate plans of member nations and found them lacking.\n\n\"The climate crisis is not just changing the planet – it is changing children,\" according to a report from the United Nations Children's Fund, released on Monday.\n\nWho's to blame for climate change?Scientists don't hold back in new federal report.\n\nHuman-induced climate change is warming Earth\n\nThis year, more than nine in 10 people worldwide encountered high temperatures made much more likely because of human-caused climate change, the Lancet report found. It represents the consensus of more than 100 experts from dozens of research institutions and UN agencies. Topics include 47 indicators of household air pollution, financing of fossil fuels and engagement from international organizations on the health benefits of limiting climate change.\n\nAmong its findings:\n\nThe heat was most extreme in the tropics, concentrating the impact on developing countries.\n\nEvery country experienced some level of climate-driven heat, including the U.S.\n\nHeat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% from 1990–2000, above the 38% increase that was expected if temperatures had not changed.\n\nThe unprecedented heat this year has sparked widespread alarm among many climate scientists. The global average temperature through October was the highest on record, nearly 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial average, the European Union's Climate Change Service said last week.\n\nIf the global average temperature rises by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial times by mid-century, the world could see a 370% increase in heat-related deaths and increasing food insecurity for more than a half-billion people, the report states.\n\nHealth consequences of climate change\n\nHealth consequences of climate change come directly from warming temperatures, melting ice that can lead to floods and expose new pathogens and droughts that affect the food supply and the likelihood of forest fires. Contagious diseases are likely to spread more, too, experts said, either through vectors like mosquitoes that can survive in new, warming regions or because people searching for new food sources are coming into closer contact with wild animals, passing on diseases like Ebola.\n\nThe increased intensity and frequency of wildfires have undermined air quality improvements since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, Beyeler said, and have even led to reversals in some areas. \"There's emerging evidence that smoke may be even more harmful to health than non-smoke particulate pollution,\" she added.\n\nThe scale of the exposures was greater this year than ever before, with tens of millions of Americans breathing in unhealthy air from Canadian wildfires.\n\nThis, combined with extreme heat events which especially harm older adults, placed an added burden on the health system, Beyeler noted.\n\nHeat waves occur when temperatures remain elevated for several days in a row, including overnight. They're particularly dangerous because the overnight warmth doesn't give people, animals or crops any chance to recover, Karin Gleason, chief of the monitoring section at the National Centers for Environmental Information, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"If you don’t cool down several nights in a row there are higher mortality rates,” Gleason said. “Crops and plants and animals need that recovery overnight so they can deal with the intensity of the daytime highs the next day.\"\n\nAs countries in parts of Europe faced sweltering temperatures this summer, hospitals were \"quite stretched,\" in treating victims of heat-related illness, said Joyce Kumutai, a research associate and climate scientist at the London-based Grantham Institute.\n\n\"We saw something close to COVID-era stretching of hospital facilities,\" Kumutai said.\n\nWhat individuals can do\n\nEveryone has a role to play in fighting climate change and safeguarding human health, said Titus Schleyer, a research scientist at the Regenstrief Institute, in Indianapolis, who is leading a summit this week focused on using data to fight the medical consequences of climate change.\n\n\"It's easy to be hopeless, but that's not going to get us anywhere. That just seals our fate,\" he said.\n\nHe hopes to use medical informatics to reduce the negative effects of climate change, by providing and analyzing large-scale data about the impacts.\n\n\"Data is crucial to understanding where is global warming going and what we can do short-term and medium-term,\" said Schleyer, whose conference this week is part of the American Medical Informatics Association's annual meeting in New Orleans. \"We have only one big try and we've got to succeed.\"\n\nPeople can consume fewer resources, cut back on airplane travel, recycle, compost and talk to public officials about taking climate action, Schleyer said.\n\nAt the community level, switching a single school bus from diesel gasoline to electric power \"can improve a child's asthma who rides that busy every day by about 30%,\" Nadeau said. Within a month after the switch, the child will be 30% less likely to have an asthma attack and also less likely to end up in an emergency room.\n\nTrees combat the \"heat island effect\" of so much concrete in cities. Investing $1 in planting city trees saves about $5 in emergency room costs, she said. \"And you don't have to wait a lifetime to see those economic benefits.\"\n\nBeyeler added that people can also help reduce pollution from cars by supporting safe walking and biking in their communities.\n\nThe Lancet report, Beyeler said, pushes people to see the connections as it tries to \"highlight places where we can make progress on both (climate and health) goals at the same time.\"\n\nAlthough a lot has gone wrong in the last 18 months, with heat waves and forest fires, Beyeler said, a lot has gone right, too. There has been more investment in renewable energy and away from fossil fuels, she said. At the same time, the federal government has renewed its commitment to COP28's climate goals and to reducing health and climate inequities.\n\n\"There is momentum to be built on,\" Beyeler said. \"At the same time, even with that progress, the scale of implementation and action that's needed to get us from where we are now to where we need to be is still tremendous.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com and Dinah Voyles Pulver at dpulver@gannett.com\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Tuesday, November 28th, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday a ceasefire has been extended in the Israel-Hamas War, plus we're learning more about what captivity was like for hostages, and we have some tips to help budget holiday shopping.\n\n♦\n\nIsrael and Hamas have agreed to extend their ceasefire until at least tomorrow. 11 Israeli hostages were released by Hamas yesterday and entered Israel while 33 Palestinians were released from Israeli prison and arrived earlier today in the West Bank. Almost 70 women and children have been released by Hamas since Friday when the current truce deal began, including about 50 Israelis. Hamas and other militants are still holding about 160 hostages. Around 150 women and children have been released from Israeli prisons.\n\nIt's still not clear what the conflict might look like after Wednesday. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres yesterday reiterated his calls for a long-term ceasefire and the release of all hostages and US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is set to visit the region later this week. The US has pledged support for Israel's offensive in Gaza and the full release of hostages from Hamas. But the State Department said Blinken will also discuss efforts to protect civilian life in Gaza and speed up deliveries of aid into the territory.\n\n♦\n\nAs Hamas releases some of the hostages, we're beginning to get a picture of what captivity was like for many. I spoke with USA today White House correspondent Joey Garrison for more. Joey, thanks for making the time.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nHey, thanks for having me on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOne American hostage has been freed so far, four-year-old Abigail Edan. What do we know about her, Joey, and what's she been through these past few weeks?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nShe was, on October 7th, among the 240 hostages who were taken from Israel and her parents were killed during the attacks, so she was brought to Gaza, and for the Biden administration getting her back free from Hamas has been among the top priorities. She so far is the only American who has been taken out. She's in Israel right now with extended family members, and she is doing as well as she can, as far as we know. Of course, we still have hostages still in Gaza. There's about nearly 10 Americans who are held hostage right now. So there's still a lot of work to be done, and obviously for the US getting some of those Americans out is paramount.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. I want to hear about the US strategy here in a second, Joey, but how about some of the older folks who were released in recent days? What condition are they in and what do they say about their experiences?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nWell, from we can tell based on the few hostages who've talked to the press is they're really kept in complete or near total darkness, in which we'd already learned that they're being held or were held in underground tunnels that Hamas has in various parts of Gaza. Some of those have been thought to be below hospitals in Gaza. They seem to be fed irregularly given mostly rice and bread one person said. And one elderly person said that they had lost about 15 pounds since they had entered Gaza. Of course, it's been about 50 days, so that's pretty severe malnutrition there.\n\nIn terms of sleeping, one person described having to push together a couple of plastic chairs. Another hostage said that they were kept asleep in a very large hall with a mattress kind of thrown on the ground. And then you have the question of medical attention that many of the hostages have not been able to receive, and that's been an issue with some, but it does seem like they were fed, albeit on an irregular basis. Some of those questions we're learning, as day by day, more hostages are coming out.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Joey, you cover the White House. So just how involved was the Biden administration in brokering these hostage releases?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nQuietly behind the scenes, President Biden has been asked a lot over the last several weeks, \"What are you doing to get these hostages out?\" And he's been pretty tightlipped about what he has said, but that behind the scenes the US put together what officials described as kind of a secret US cell that was communicating with Qatar and Egyptians, which have been the main intermediaries between Israel and Hamas to broker the hostage deal that we're seeing carrying out right now. And at times there was direct involvement from President Biden talking to leaders of Qatar to try to push the ball forward and getting this deal secured. And there was lots of ups and downs in these negotiations.\n\nOne hold up, initially Hamas was not going to give any identification information about the hostages that we're going to release, the ethnicity of those people, which country they're from, but that was kind of a non-starter from the US and they insisted that those come out. And of course, you have the temporary ceasefire that Israel has agreed to. There was a two-day extension on that, and so that's why we're seeing about 20 more hostages right now being released. But it was sort of a monumental feat to get to this point. Some people wondered if a deal could be reached, but again, there's over 150 hostages who remain in there, so the work is nowhere near done.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJoey Garrison covers the White House for USA today. Thank you as always, Joey.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nHey, thanks a lot.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis year's Global United Nations Run Climate Summit, known as COP 28 kicks off this Thursday, hosted by the United Arab Emirates. Climate activists have long pointed out the irony of having one of the world's top 10 oil producers host a conference dedicated to reducing carbon emissions, but perceptions of intent matter on the global stage. And on this point, the UAE may have already received a failing grade. According to leaked documents obtained by the Center for Climate Reporting yesterday, a nonprofit investigative journalism organization, the UAE is planning to use official meetings at the high profile event to secure up to 15 new fossil fuel deals.\n\nDr. Sultan Al Jaber, the UAE'S chosen COP President also happens to be CEO of the federation's state run oil and gas company ADNOC. Among other items on this year's agenda is securing commitments from member states to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a level scientists say is critical in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Doing that scientists say will require ending all use of fossil fuels as quickly as possible.\n\n♦\n\nWell, it's that time of year again, gift giving season for many and it's easy to lose track of how much he should be spending. But USA TODAY Personal Finance Reporter Daniel de Vise has some tips for setting a budget on your holiday shopping. Daniel, good to have you on. Thanks for making the time.\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nAnytime. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Daniel, let's just start here. How much of one's annual salary is recommended to be spent on holiday gifts?\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nClearPoint, which is a credit counseling nonprofit, suggests you start with 1.5% of your annual income. So if you're a family earning 75,000 a year, which is around the national average, that would work out to $1,125. But that wouldn't all go to gifts. That also includes throwing a party, maybe doing a little bit of travel, so something under that figure, something maybe in the high three figures for an average American family.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Daniel, you mentioned something called the 50/30/20 rule in this piece, it seemed like some pretty good common sense to me. Can you explain what this is?\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nYeah. So if you haven't spent the whole year saving up for the holidays, which most of us don't, you can use that kind of formula, that 50% of your paycheck, your take home pay goes into needs, shelter, food essentials, and then 20% goes toward debt repayment, savings and that also is kind of stuff you can't get around. So the last 30% is \"wants\", which is discretionary stuff. Kimberly Palmer of NerdWallet, she suggests you carve your holiday budget out of that wants category, and you can do this over a couple of pay periods, maybe in November and December, that 30% of money that you would spend on going to the movies and going out to eat and going to concerts, you could just not do some of those things, go to Starbucks or wherever less often, and divert some of that money into a holiday fund basically.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOn the gifts front, what advice are you hearing about giving useful gifts this holiday season?\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nSome people in this space would argue that it's really smart to give a gift that somebody will actually use. There is research on this topic and it shows that the average person wastes \"about 70 bucks a year on gifts that no one wants.\" And those gifts are the ones that wind up at the back of the shelf or in the bin, or it's just sort of stuffed in the recycling pile at the end of the holiday. So some people who are expert in this topic say, \"Look for something that the person's going to actually use.\" One of my sources said, if your child has to get a new tennis racket at some point anyway, get them a really awesome one and have that be the gift, something that you know they're going to end up using. That's just so that you don't feel like there's any chance that the hard-earned money you're spending on these gifts won't be wasted.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Daniel, I thought this part of the piece was interesting, these awkward conversations and relationships can pop up around gift giving. How can you set boundaries or expectations with loved ones around gift giving?\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nWell, I hear over and over that if you're planning to spend a lot less on gifts, tell your loved ones that, don't just surprise them because it might come as an unpleasant surprise. But it's an awkward conversation to have. One of the sources I interviewed said, \"You might just put it in a text message or an email telling your loved one, I'm going to go a little light this year, and I think you should do the same.\" Give them a chance to sort of process that and process their feelings because this is such an emotional topic. And then get back to you sort of dispassionately on their schedule.\n\nMost likely they'll be thrilled because other research shows that we hate getting a really, really fancy present. And the reason we hate it, it embarrasses them. It makes us feel bad. It makes you feel indebted to the person who gave it to you. We actually prefer less costly presents, believe it or not, and so there's all the reason to have that conversation with loved ones.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Daniel. Daniel de Vise covers personal finance for USA today. Thanks as always, Daniel.\n\nDaniel de Vise:\n\nThank you. Anytime.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA late fall cold wave is hitting parts of the Midwest south and east coast this morning, sending temperatures to mid-winter levels for around a hundred million Americans. The National Weather Service says that highs today will dip into the thirties in parts of New England and even as far south as the Carolinas, while areas along the Great Lakes could feel temperatures into the twenties along with snowy conditions. AccuWeather reports that the unusually cold air mass comes from northern parts of Canada. And if you're not quite ready for winter, don't worry, temperatures for most of the affected regions are expected to warm up in the second half of the week.\n\n♦\n\nAnd today is giving Tuesday, one of the biggest fundraising dates on the calendar. Nonprofits and industry groups say that in comparison to previous years, donations are so far down in 2023. That's why many groups will be running matching campaigns this year. So if you're planning on donating before the end of the year, you might just be more impactful if you give today.\n\n♦\n\nThanks for listening to The Excerpt.

Kissinger, 100, was the most celebrated U.S. statesman in modern times, helping former President Richard Nixon establish U.S. relations with China, reaching Cold War detente and arms agreements with the Soviet Union and conducting “shuttle diplomacy” to defuse Middle East tension. Kissinger at the same time was an intensely controversial figure and a lightning rod for critics of Nixon’s foreign policy, particularly in conduct of the Vietnam War as well as staging the rise of authoritarian rulers in Latin America.

But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/middleeast/egypt-protests-crackdown-cop27-intl/index.html", "title": "Egypt faces criticism over crackdown on activists ahead of COP27 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEgypt is facing a barrage of criticism over what rights groups say is a crackdown on protests and activists, as it prepares to host the COP27 climate summit starting Sunday.\n\nRights groups have accused the Egyptian government of arbitrarily detaining activists after Egyptian dissidents abroad called for protests to be held against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on November 11, during the United Nations climate talks.\n\nAccording to rights groups, security forces have been setting up checkpoints on Cairo streets, stopping people and searching their phones to find any content related to the planned protests.\n\nThe Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), an NGO, said Wednesday that 93 people had been arrested in Egypt in recent days. It said that according to national security prosecution investigations, some of those arrested have allegedly sent videos calling for protests over social messaging apps. Some were also charged with abuse of social media, spreading false news and joining terrorist organizations – a repressive charge commonly used by the security apparatus against activists.\n\nIndian climate activist Ajit Rajagopal was detained in Cairo last Sunday after setting off on a protest walk from the Egyptian capital to Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the COP27 conference will be held from November 6 to 18. Rajagopal was released after a brief detention in Cairo along with his friend, lawyer Makarios Lahzy, a Facebook post by Lahzy said. Reuters, which spoke to Rajagopal following his release Monday, cited the Indian activist as saying he was still trying to get accredited for COP27 but did not plan to resume his march.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Egyptian authorities for comment.\n\nEgypt went through two mass uprisings in 2011 and 2013 which eventually paved the way for then-military chief Sisi to take power. Thousands of activists have since been jailed, spaces for public expression have been quashed and press freedom diminished.\n\nWhile protests are rare – and mostly illegal – in Egypt, a looming economic crisis and a brutal security regime have spurred renewed calls for demonstrations by dissidents seeking to exploit a rare window of opportunity presented by the climate summit.\n\nOne jailed activist, British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abdelfattah, escalated his hunger strike in an Egyptian prison this week, amid warnings by relatives over his deteriorating health. “Alaa has been on hunger strike for 200 days, he’s been surviving on only 100 calories of liquid a day,” said Sanaa Seif, Abdelfattah’s sister, who is staging a sit-in outside the UK Foreign Office in London.\n\nA place for dialogue\n\nCOP, the annual UN-sponsored climate summit that brings together the signatories of the Paris Agreement on combating climate change, is traditionally a place where representatives of civil society have an opportunity to mingle with experts and policy makers and observe negotiations firsthand.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see a young activist approaching a national delegation walking down the corridor to their next meeting or an indigenous leader chatting to a minister on the sidelines of a debate.\n\nAnd while security is always strict – this is, after all, a gathering attended by dozens of heads of states and governments – peaceful protests have always been part of COP. Tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of last year’s host city of Glasgow, Scotland, during the summit.\n\nYet Egypt has tightened the rules on who can access the talks.\n\nAs in the past, this year’s COP conference will take place across two different sites. The official part of the summit is run by the UN and is only accessible to accredited people, including the official delegations, representatives of NGOs and other civil society groups, experts, journalists and other observers.\n\nThen there is a separate public venue where climate exhibitions and events take place throughout the two weeks of the summit. But while this public part of the summit was in the past open to anyone, people wishing to attend this year will need to register ahead of time.\n\nThe chance to protest will also be restricted.\n\nWhile the Egyptian government has pledged to allow demonstrations, it has said protests will have to take place in a special “protest zone,” a dedicated space away from the main conference site, and will have to be announced in advance. Guidelines published on the official COP website say that any other marches would need to be specially approved.\n\nAnyone wanting to organize a protest will need to be registered for the public part of the conference – a requirement that may scare off activists fearing surveillance. Among the rules imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the protests is a ban on the use of “impersonated objects, such as satirical drawings of Heads of States, negotiators, individuals.”\n\nRights groups sound alarm\n\nThe UN has urged Egypt to ensure the public has a say at the conference.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said it was “essential that everyone – including civil society representatives – is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh” and that decisions about climate change need to be “transparent, inclusive and accountable.”\n\nSeparately, a group of five independent human rights experts, all of them UN special rapporteurs, published a statement last month expressing alarm over restrictions ahead of the summit. They said the Egyptian government had placed strict limits on who can participate in the talks and how, and said that “a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists.”\n\n“This new wave follows years of persistent and sustained crackdowns on civil society and human rights defenders using security as a pretext to undermine the legitimate rights of civil society to participate in public affairs in Egypt,” the group said in a statement.\n\nA group of Egyptian civil rights groups has launched a petition calling for the Egyptian authorities to end the prosecutions of civil society activists and organizations and end restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\n\n“The Egyptian authorities have for years employed draconian laws, including laws on counter terrorism, cyber crimes, and civil society, to stifle all forms of peaceful dissent and shut down civic space,” the groups said in the petition.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth and scores of other groups have also spoken up, demanding the release of detained activists.\n\nIn the lead-up to the climate conference, the Egyptian government presented an initiative pardoning prisoners jailed for their political activity. Authorities also pointed to a new prison, Badr-3, 70 kilometers (43 miles) northeast of Cairo, where other prisoners were moved to purportedly better conditions.\n\nBut rights groups said the government’s initiatives amounted to little change.\n\n“Ahead of COP27, Egypt’s PR machine is operating on all cylinders to conceal the awful reality in the country’s jails, where prisoners held for political reasons are languishing in horrific conditions violating the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.\n\n“Prisoners are facing the same human rights violations that have repeatedly blighted older institutions, exposing the lack of a political will from the Egyptian authorities to bring an end to the human rights crisis in the country.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}]}

The shift to electric vehicles, according to Will Kaufman, news editor at car research site Edmunds.\n\n“This is really this first big sort of changing of the guard moment for an established mainstream brand,” Kaufman said. “As more and more (electric cars) come out, the question is going to start being less if other nameplates are going to be discontinued to make more room for them, but when those are going to be discontinued.”\n\nDodge Charger and Challenger\n\nDodge will stop making Chargers and Challengers – two popular muscle cars – before the end of the year, according to a recent statement from parent company Stellantis.\n\nThe models had experienced enormous success over the years, with the Challenger named the No. 1 muscle car in the country in 2021. Dodge brand chief executive officer Tim Kuniskis said the end of the cars’ run signals “the start of a bright new electrified future” as Stellanis aims to have 50% of its passenger car and light-duty truck sales in the U.S. come from electric vehicles by 2030.\n\n“This is a really sort of big moment.

There is no electric successor to the car, but Dahncke said Audi is \"investigating options of what that could be.”\n\n“For now, the RS e-tron GT fully electric performance car is the halo of our e-tron lineup but it is not a replacement for the R8,” Dahncke said.\n\nThe TT, which premiered in 1998, will be phased out by the end of the year as the compact two-door coupe and roadster segments shrink worldwide.\n\n“In some markets, particularly where demand for all-electric models already exceeds that of combustion engines, we are already no longer offering the Audi TT,” Dahncke said in an emailed statement. “In the coming years, we want to focus our Technical Development and Audi Design capacities entirely on expanding the battery electric and hybrid models.”\n\nKia Stinger\n\nKia will end production of the Stinger, a fastback sedan first introduced in the U.S. as a 2019 model, after the 2023 model. More than 65,000 Stinger sedans have since been sold in the country.\n\n\"While it may be the end of the road for Stinger, its legacy lives on through our innovative products, both current and forthcoming,” Kia America Chief Operating Officer Steven Center said in an April release.\n\nNissan Maxima\n\nForty-two years after its debut, Nissan is halting production of the Maxima in mid-2023.\n\nSpokesperson Ashli Bobo said the decision comes from Nissan’s decision to prioritize electric vehicles, with 40% of Nissan vehicle sales expected to be fully electric by 2030.\n\n“It makes sense for them to focus more on electric SUVs at the moment,” Kaufman said. \"The Maxima wasn't selling very well, the Altima and Sentra handily outsold it.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023.

CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/business/food-inflation-habits/index.html", "title": "Food prices are soaring, and that's changed how we eat | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nLisa Altman used to take pride in being able to eat what she wanted without worrying much about the cost.\n\nWhen she was growing up, seconds weren’t served and side dishes were rare. “My mom had a budget every week, and she stuck to it,” she said. “As I got older and became more financially independent, having a full pantry and being able to eat what I wanted was a sign of success for me,” she added.\n\n“It was very humbling to have to go from that situation to where we’re at right now.”\n\nAltman and her wife live in Austin, Texas with their three children. Recently, they’ve been relying mostly on one income. Their reduced earnings, coupled with inflation, have dealt a blow to their finances.\n\nAnd that has changed, radically, the way they eat. Altman is not alone in making big changes.\n\nWe asked CNN readers how inflation has impacted their eating habits, and many mentioned dining out less often, buying less meat and giving up splurges. Some said they are very worried about the future.\n\nFood prices have spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released in mid-September by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8% in that period.\n\nWith food prices soaring, people are changing how they shop and eat. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsumers are responding by looking for deals and switching to generic brands, according to July data from the market research firm IRI. Companies like Tyson (TSN) have noticed customers are switching from beef to chicken, and Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers who are likely trading down from pricier restaurants. Some people may be dining out less often, or avoiding restaurants altogether.\n\nFor those who struggled to buy food even before prices shot up, rising costs could mean falling into food insecurity, a state of unreliable access to affordable food.\n\n“If food prices continue to increase at a rate that outpaces increases in wages, that is the inevitable consequence,” said Jayson Lusk, head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University. “The last time we had a big run up in food insecurity rates was in the wake of the Great Recession.” Last year, about 10.2% of US households were food insecure, according to the USDA, slightly below the 10.5% rate in 2020 and 2019.\n\nEven for those not at risk of hunger, the surges in food prices are jarring.\n\nFood “matters a lot to our self esteem, our mood,” said William Masters, a professor at Tufts University’ school of nutrition science and policy who is also a member of the economics department faculty. “Not being able to buy the foods that people are used to — that your children are asking for, that your family wants — that’s a really hard thing,” he said. “Any disruption of habit is very, very hard.”\n\nGiving up on simple pleasures\n\nCarol Ehrman taking a Thai cooking class over Zoom during the pandemic. Courtesy Carol and Tommy Ehrman\n\nFor Carol Ehrman, cooking is a joyful experience.\n\n“I love to cook, it’s my favorite thing to do,” she said. She especially likes to cook Indian and Thai food, but stocking the spices and ingredients she needs for those dishes is no longer feasible. “When every ingredient has gone up, that adds up on the total bill,” she said.\n\n“What used to cost us $250 to $300 … is now $400.” Ehrman, 60, and her husband, 65, rely on his social security income, and the increase was stretching their budget. “We just couldn’t do that.”\n\nAbout six months ago, she realized she had to change the way she shops for groceries.\n\nIn an effort to bring their immediate costs down, Ehrman stopped shopping in bulk as often as she used to. Now, she hunts for sales, avoids buying beef, and opts for boxed wine instead of nice bottles when she buys wine at all. She’s also cooking simpler meals, and saying goodbye to dinner parties.\n\nEhrman haș even given up preparing basic items, like tomato sauce, because of the expense, opting instead for a pre-packaged version.\n\n“I know that I can make it much healthier,” she said. And “it always tastes so much better.” Those fresh ingredients are just too pricey now.\n\nEhrman’s husband is retired due to chronic health problems, and it’s been difficult for her to work because of her own health issues — she recently had pacemaker and heart catheterization procedures. The couple, who live in Billings, Montana, were frugal before the current spike in prices, enjoying simple pleasures. But now, even those are out of reach.\n\n“Before, we at least found joy in being home and having friends over and family over, cooking and sitting around the table and just being content,” she said. Now, “I’m not entertaining at all. It’s really sad.”\n\nFrom Coke to Pepsi\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 - Source: CNN Business\n\nRick Wichmann, 64, and his wife have been dining out less often in recent years, due to the pandemic and in an effort to eat healthier. With menu prices rising because of inflation, they see no reason to change their habits.\n\n“Eating out is expensive,” he said, noting that he’s often happier with home-cooked meals than restaurant food anyway.\n\nBut grocery shopping is also more expensive. Over the past year, Wichmann noticed that he had been spending about 25% more shopping for groceries for himself, his wife and their son than he used to.\n\nTo help mitigate those costs, Wichmann, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, started going to different grocers. He avoids Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, opting instead for Costco and the local chain Market Basket.\n\nHe’s also switched to store brands, if he feels the quality is the same, and will sometimes choose products based on price rather than brand loyalty — like, for example, buying Pepsi when it’s cheaper, when he’d otherwise choose Coke.\n\nWichmann also pays attention to events like weather, and how they might affect prices. When he saw reports of a possible tomato shortage due to droughts in California, he took notice. The next time he saw tomato sauce on sale he stocked up on enough to last for months.\n\nA vegetable garden in the front lawn\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 - Source: CNN Business\n\nLike Wichmann, Jenni Wells, 38, pays attention to weather patterns and food systems. A former chef and rancher, she noticed price increases well before the current bout of inflation.\n\n“My alarm bells started going off for prices going up in 2019,” she said, when devastating floods in the midwest drowned livestock and destroyed grain stocks. Wells decided back then that she’d like to be more self sufficient.\n\n“I saw the food prices going up, and I realized that it was going to quickly overwhelm our budget,” she said. So in February, she ripped up the grass in the front lawn of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, which she shares with her husband and best friend, and planted a vegetable garden.\n\n“I just wanted to see what I could grow for myself,” she said. This year, she’s managed to grow broccoli, cauliflower, okra, tomatoes, peppers, squashes and more in her garden.\n\nThere are upfront and maintenance costs for the garden, of course. And it’s not easy to grow vegetables. But the household’s weekly grocery spending, excluding meat, has fallen from about $200 to $50, she said.\n\nWith the money left over, Wells and her household have been able to eat at restaurants, something that would have been “too much of a luxury” had they still been spending $200 a week on groceries. And there’s the satisfaction of growing your own food.\n\n“There’s a huge sense of reward,” she said. “I feel pride in every meal that I make with it.”\n\nChanging for good\n\nA recent weekly grocery haul for Lisa Altman. Courtesy Lisa Altman\n\nSome consumers have made changes because of current circumstances that they plan to hold onto.\n\nNow, Altman, the Austin parent of three, aims to keep her grocery bill to about $100 to $125 per week by buying store brands, lots of pasta and a limited amount of protein each week.\n\nInstead of ordering in or grilling steaks or ribs, Altman’s family eats more basic meals with smaller portions. “Now our meals consist of one primary dish, and that’s it, maybe some bread on the side, or a salad.” If they go out to eat, they’ll pick up a fast food meal with a few sides, like one burger and two fries, split the items and have beverages at home.\n\nWhen Altman is able to afford it, she’ll go back to buying more fruits and veggies. But she’s hoping some habits, like encouraging her children to avoid mindless eating and reducing food waste, will stick.\n\n“I’m not going to be spending $1,200 a month on groceries,” she said. “This has taught us that that’s not necessary.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/voting-election-day-lawsuits-2022/index.html", "title": "Voting goes mostly smoothly on Election Day as baseless fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nState and local elections officials said Tuesday’s voting in the midterm elections went smoothly overall, with a few isolated problems reported, including in the key swing state of Arizona where issues with voting machines sparked baseless claims about fraud.\n\nIn Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous, Republicans filed a lawsuit seeking to keep polls open three hours after they were scheduled to close, claiming there were excessive delays and long lines due to ballot tabulator malfunctions. A county judge, however, denied the request, saying that while some voters may have been confused or faced difficulties, he “does not have any evidence” voters were unable to vote.\n\nMaricopa County officials said tabulators had tech issues in about 20% of its voting locations. Maricopa County chairman Bill Gates and recorder Stephen Richer advised voters experiencing issues to put their ballots inside a secure box attached to the tabulators and assured they would be counted by bipartisan vote counters after polls close.\n\n“There was no one who came today with a valid ID who was turned away from the polls,” Gates told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “Even when we had this [issue] and we hadn’t figured out the solution, people were still able to vote. It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.”\n\nMore on voting rights Election deniers in charge of some county election offices are continuing to sow mistrust in the electoral system Officials in Texas’ most populous county ask DOJ to send federal monitors in response to state plans to send observers for general election Arizona refers voter intimidation report to Justice Department Texas secretary of state’s office announces inspection of general election count in most populous county\n\nBut the tabulator problems were baselessly played up as signs of voter fraud in right-wing media, including by Donald Trump Jr., after a post showed an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters.\n\nElection officials have particularly faced newfound pressures from the conspiratorial right. Led by former President Donald Trump, a growing number of Republican politicians have attacked the legitimacy of the vote and repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On Tuesday, Trump and his allies were quick to launch similar baseless attacks.\n\n“Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???” Trump wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. Trump also amplified a false claim about voter fraud in Michigan through his social media.\n\nThere was no evidence of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections.\n\nIn addition to the conspiracies about vote tabulators in Maricopa County, Charlie Kirk, the founder of right-wing group Turning Point USA, falsely tweeted there was a “2 hour wait minimum” at most polling places in the county. Maricopa County debunked the claim, and the county’s online wait-time tracker showed dozens of polling locations had waits of under five minutes.\n\nState and local officials and voting rights advocates have raised the alarm that the political attacks, including a marked rise in threats of violence against election workers, have sparked an exodus of local elections officials in charge of the vote.\n\nAmong the most serious issues was in a suburb of Milwaukee, where a 38-year-old man was arrested after threatening voters with a knife, briefly forcing one polling place to close.\n\nThe man demanded that staff “stop the voting,” the West Bend Police Department said in a statement. He was arrested without incident and no injuries were reported, police said.\n\nDespite these concerns, the vast majority of the tens of millions who cast ballots on Tuesday will do so without issue, in an election where early voting has been ahead of 2018 levels. Roughly 8 in 10 of voters in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nWhile multiple states reported attempted cyberattacks on their websites on Election Day – including a “sustained outage” of a website in Mississippi – none of the hacks have prevented anyone from voting, federal officials told reporters Tuesday evening.\n\n“What we are seeing are things that we usually see on Election Day,” said Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause. “Sometimes voters are going in and one of the voting machines isn’t working, or lines are a little longer.”\n\nSecretaries of state reported few problems. “I would say this was a very smooth election,” Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters Tuesday evening.\n\nMichigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow said Tuesday that “things are going smoothly” with elections in the state. Pennsylvania’s acting Democratic secretary of state, Leigh Chapman, said Tuesday that while it would take “a few days” for the state to finish counting its results, as expected, there were just “a handful of typical Election Day incidents,” including a few polling places opening late, power outages and a gas leak.\n\n“All were quickly handled,” she said.\n\nCynthia Nogar, who voted for Democratic candidates in Rochester, Minnesota, told CNN her voting location at a local church was organized and went smoothly despite her own concerns.\n\n“I couldn’t help but be a little concerned about what might happen … but it was just as quiet as usual,” she said. “That was really nice. It was kind of a relief, you know?”\n\nHandful of polls to stay open late\n\nThe vast majority of voting issues were decidedly minor and small scale, such as long lines, bad weather or tech glitches.\n\nIn a handful of counties across the country, there were problems that prompted precincts to stay open later.\n\nSix precincts across Georgia were ordered to remain open later because they opened late Tuesday morning, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s acting Deputy Secretary of State.\n\nIn Bell County, Texas, polls were kept open an additional hour after some check-in machines at voting centers were not working Tuesday morning due to synchronization issues tied to the switch from Daylight Saving Time. A judge in Houston ordered voting locations in Harris County to stay open for an additional hour after several polling locations didn’t open on time.\n\nThe North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts to close an hour later in North Carolina after their opening was delayed.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, approximately 44 polling places were impacted by a paper shortage in Luzerne County, prompting an extension of in-person voting, according to a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\nFurther, an extra verification process to ensure voters didn’t vote both by mail and in person could delay counting ballots and getting election results in Philadelphia, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nCornelius Whiting fills out his ballot at an early voting location in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday, September 26.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nReaders of this newsletter are frequently reminded of the shortcomings of the US form of government:\n\nA generational conservative shift at the Supreme Court is upending precedent to erode abortion rights and enshrine gun rights;\n\nAn intractable minority in the Senate can filibuster most meaningful change, particularly on climate change;\n\nGerrymandering means politicians are picking their voters rather than the other way around.\n\nThe format feels immovable; the country has outgrown a Constitution there is no hope of changing.\n\nSo it might be a surprise to read this edition focused on how the Constitution has changed for the better and might promise new changes sooner than you think.\n\nAfter picking up the recently published book The People’s Constitution: 200 Years, 27 Amendments, and the Promise of a More Perfect Union, I was surprised at the optimism from authors John Kowal and Wilfred Codrington III of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.\n\nI talked to Kowal about what’s happening now and why he’s optimistic about the future. Key portions of our phone conversation, edited lightly for flow, are below.\n\nPeople should try to do big things\n\nWHAT MATTERS: First, briefly talk about these decisions on abortion and guns recently and whether addressing them will require changing the Constitution.\n\nKOWAL: We wrote the book to challenge the kind of pervasive sense of defeatism about amending the Constitution where people assume it’s not even worth trying. We tried to tell the story of how amendments have come in waves for the most part, and so there can be long periods where it feels impossible to amend the Constitution similar to the way it feels today. But then, certain conditions lead to a shaking of the tectonic plates, if you will, and in a very short period of time there can be three, four or five amendments.\n\nThe heart of the Constitution is in the changes\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You point out in your book that the Constitution was written by 55 men over four months, hundreds of years ago, but much of what we consider the heart of the document at this point comes from the 3,000 words that have been added afterward, and some of those even in our lifetimes. Explain that.\n\nKOWAL: So when we talk about the Constitution, people tend to focus on those four months in 1787 and it is a remarkable story of people with very different views and priorities coming together on a compromised Constitution.\n\nBut it’s rarely taught in school that more than 40% of the Constitution was written after 1787 in the form of these 27 Amendments. These amendments, over time, have made the Constitution a more progressive document by making it more democratic, more inclusive and more suited to the needs of a changing country.\n\nThe framers … expected the Constitution would be amended, and in fact, the generation that wrote the Constitution, approved 12 amendments to the Constitution in a short period of time, so they didn’t expect it to be rare. They expected it to be a little difficult but not impossible.\n\nBut legislation can’t even get past the filibuster.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Amending the Constitution requires a lot.\n\nFirst, either 2/3 vote of both houses of Congress (that’s a higher threshold than the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate) or 2/3 of state legislatures calling a convention.\n\nSecond, passage by either legislatures or special conventions called in 3/4 of the states.\n\nMeaningful legislation can’t even get past the filibuster in the Senate.\n\nWhy should we be focusing on doing something that’s more than what seems possible today?\n\nKOWAL: The filibuster is a real and unfortunate impediment to democratic action, because it allows a minority to block action. But if you eliminated the filibuster today, which would be a salutary change, it would open the door to all kinds of legislation that has been stuck, but it wouldn’t actually necessarily allow for certain fundamental changes that can really only be done by amending the Constitution. For example, changing the Electoral College would require amending the Constitution; 60 senators can’t will it away.\n\nWhy this could be the end of a dry spell\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You put the 27 amendments into four essential waves. There’s the Bill of Rights amendments, the Reconstruction amendments, this era of progressive amendments and then the Civil Rights era amendments. What era are we in right now?\n\nKOWAL: I would say that we’re at the end of the fourth long dry spell. After the Bill of Rights era it was 61 years before another amendment was added to the Constitution.\n\nAnd then after the Reconstruction amendments, it was four decades until the progressive amendment era.\n\nAnd then it was another four decades until the ’60s and the Civil Rights era where there was this permanent change.\n\nAs of now, it’s been 50 years. … So if past is prologue, we’re in the what might be the end stages of just the cyclical dry spell. … There are indicators that suggest that in the foreseeable future, not immediate future, but foreseeable future that there could be a dramatic opening for new amendments.\n\nThese indicators point to amendments?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What are the indicators that you see?\n\nKOWAL: So we talked about certain indicators that come up time and again.\n\nOne, of course, is unhappiness with the Supreme Court that that blocks progressive change and democratic action.\n\nAnother, and this is a counterintuitive point, is that long periods of gridlock and closely divided government tend to lead to a frustration that over time forces people to turn to more drastic remedies. When short term change is thwarted, people start to focus on the long term.\n\nIf you were to analogize today to another period in history I would look at the period of the late Gilded Age – the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nThen, as now, the country was sharply polarized along regional lines. At that time, it was the East and West versus the heartland. Today, it’s the Red State/Blue State divide. The politics was gridlocked.\n\nThere were many closely fought elections for president.\n\nParty control of Congress switched every few years throughout that period.\n\nThere were two elections in which the Electoral College delivered the presidency to someone who did not win the popular vote.\n\nAlso, at that time, there was dramatic change. And that’s another indicator that sometimes periods of dramatic social and cultural transformation lead to pressure for change. So then, as now:\n\nimmigration was changing the face of the country in a way that stirred up tremendous anxiety;\n\nnew technologies were transforming the way people lived;\n\neconomic inequality was increasing dramatically.\n\nWe talked about the story of the of the 16th Amendment, the income tax amendment, which is very much driven by popular outrage that the rich dominated politics – the rich and corporations – and they made sure that they paid no taxes and that almost the entire tax burden was borne by poor people. We described in the book how an ordinary working person was spending two thirds of their income on taxes hidden in the form of tariffs and other regressive taxes.\n\nThe other indicator, and that is highly relevant, if you look at the Gilded Age period, progressive reform was being blocked at every turn by a reactionary Supreme Court that acted to protect the interests of big corporations and the rich.\n\nThe importance of a more representative Supreme Court\n\nWHAT MATTERS: FDR failed in his effort to reform the makeup of the court. You’ve argued for an amendment to reform the court to:\n\nget every President two nominees and\n\nimpose 18 year terms on justices.\n\nWould changes likes this have precluded some of these recent decisions on guns, on Roe v. Wade, on the EPA that have frustrated so many people?\n\nKOWAL: I think it would have had an impact. So for a long time, people wanted to cling to the idea that the judiciary is above politics. But for 50 years the Republican Party has made getting the right kind of nominees on the bench a priority and they did it for a reason. They did it so that they could advance an agenda. And so they have successfully used the failures of the current system. …\n\nWhat if this amendment had been in place for the last 30 years, the composition of the Supreme Court would more closely follow the results of presidential elections. …\n\nIf you go back 18 years, it’s the beginning of the second George W. Bush administration, so it’s 2004. So he would have gotten two nominees, but then Obama would have gotten four nominees, and then Trump would have gotten two nominees and then Biden would have already gotten one. So we wouldn’t have you would not have a six-three court in favor of conservatives, which is done through gamesmanship.\n\nWhat about an amendment compromise?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Conservatives have suggested a constitutional convention to impose things like term limits on lawmakers and judges and require a balanced budget. Progressives are more likely to push for an Equal Rights Amendment or to tweak the Second Amendment.\n\nIs there any precedent for amendment bargaining? Could the two sides come together and each come up with an amendment, for instance, term limits on congresspeople in addition with term limits on judges? Is there any precedent for that?\n\nKOWAL: Politics has played a role in amendments. For example, so the conservative Republicans in 1909 supported the income tax amendment as part of a bargain to basically persuade Congress not to pass an income tax law. And it blew up in their face because the amendment passed. They had been hoping that the amendment would die on the vine and not get ratified.\n\nWhy would smaller states ever agree to give up some power?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The most obvious next amendment for a lot of Americans would be to reform the Electoral College. What should a new electoral college amendment do and how would that be accomplished?\n\nKOWAL: Let me back up. If Americans really think about what the Framers did, they basically did not provide that the people have any role in picking the President. They gave this role to states. … States don’t have to allow people to vote. If they wanted to pass a law saying, ‘We’re picking the name out of a hat,’ the Constitution doesn’t, on its face, forbid it.\n\nThe American people insisted that they have the right to pick the electors, and so by the early 1800s, every state but one had such a law. South Carolina eventually relented as well. …\n\nIf it weren’t for the fact that Republicans benefited from the Electoral College twice in the last couple decades, I think there would be more significant bipartisan support for an amendment. An amendment had a lot of support in 1970 but fell short due to a filibuster. It seems these kinds of amendments always run into the problem that one side might feel that status quo is benefiting them.\n\nWhat could really work and what could make an Electoral College amendment move to the front of the line is if you can get success in passing the interstate popular vote compact. … If we could get that, then our elections become de facto national popular vote, plebiscites, and the strategies of the parties have to change. And I believe that that would bring people to the table to create a more enduring and bulletproof solution in the form of a constitutional amendment. …\n\nOne of the one of the points we tried to raise in the book is that these are long-term strategies. They don’t happen overnight. … Having people listen to your side to changing people’s minds to building a popular movement around getting another constitution and a vision of democracy, that has benefits of its own even if it’s going to take a while to pass the amendment.\n\nThese efforts can last generations\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Some of the people you talk about – the real transformational figures pushing for amendments – often don’t live to see them enacted.\n\nKOWAL: Susan B. Anthony is a great example of that.\n\nOthers do and it’s a kind of warm and fuzzy story. There’s a guy named Jennings Randolph, who was a freshman congressman in West Virginia, and proposed during World War II, that they lower the voting age to 18, seeing that so many young men were going to fight the war. … It didn’t bear fruit until 1970 in the middle of a huge societal transformation, but he was still around, and he was able to introduce the amendment for the 11th time and to do a victory lap. So sometimes patience is actually rewarded.\n\nYou’re right in other instances, it takes so long it’s like Moses. You can’t bring it to the promised land with you but you’re getting them there.\n\nWhat’s the most likely next amendment?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Is there any evidence you see of an amendment percolating right now?\n\nKOWAL: There’s a lot of interest in the Equal Rights Amendment. (Note: The amendment has passed through 3/4 of state legislatures, but not in time for a deadline Congress initially set.) People in the movement are pursuing a strategy that that calls for recognizing the 1972 Amendment as valid because Congress has the right to withdraw the deadline that they imposed back in the ’70s.\n\nAt some point, the fight might move to what they call the fresh start strategy – in other words, introduce the Equal Rights Amendment again, and fight for it. It has huge popular support. Most Americans think that the Constitution does explicitly protect women’s equality and they’re surprised to learn that it doesn’t.\n\n(The ERA) would be opposed by the same forces who oppose it last time – the religious right – but at a time when women are rightly concerned about their rights, when they’ve seen what has happened to reproductive freedoms. If they see a Supreme Court that is talking about only recognizing rights rooted in history, If you go back in 1868, women had no rights. They couldn’t vote. They didn’t participate in the writing or adoption of that amendment. So that there may be a very receptive audience to insisting, number one that the word ‘woman’ appear in the Constitution.\n\nTop 5 amendments to pass right now\n\nWhat Matters: Give me your top five amendments. (Note: I’ve added the bolded words to the bullet points below)\n\nKOWAL: Electoral College – I think my No. 1 choice would be eliminating the Electoral College and making clear that the people choose our President. The Founders, the Framers, were unwilling to do that in 1787 and many of them thought it was an absurd idea. But the truth is Americans believe that the people should choose. If anything, the attempted coup in January of 2021 shows that the Electoral College is ripe for potential misuse and that our democracy might be hanging by a thread if we don’t get rid of it.\n\nEqual Rights – Second, I would say the Equal Rights Amendment because next year will be the 100th anniversary of when it was first promulgated or put out there by Alice Paul and others. And I think it would be a fitting way to celebrate the anniversary by a strong push to get it in the Constitution.\n\nSupreme Court – Third, I think would be rationalizing our system for selecting Supreme Court justices. The framers talked about judiciary as the weakest branch. They had no idea that it would be as powerful as it is, and they had no idea that people would live so long and stay on the court for 30, 40 years. I think the political wars over judicial selection could be tempered if we had a fairer system, where every president gets a chance to put their stamp on the court.\n\nVoting – Fourth, I would say is a voting amendment. The framers made a fateful choice: instead of deciding the question of who is eligible to vote, they left it to each state to determine and they use a kind of a rule that sounds outmoded today. … What they should have done was to enshrine a universal right to vote as the foundation of a democratic society. It was the road not taken at various points in our history where what we’ve done is we’ve amended the Constitution to ban certain kinds of discrimination. But we never really went to the original sin of why we allow states to decide who gets to vote.\n\nCongressional succession – The fifth one, I think, is a technical one, but it’s one where we’ve not done the smart thing for a long time. It would be an amendment to deal with a flaw in the way we replace members of the House of Representatives. … When a member of the House dies or leaves office, every state using its own system calls a special election that takes months. … As we think about what would happen if there was a catastrophic attack on Congress, and it’s not unthinkable. If a third of the House dies and some catastrophe, the House would not function. … I think it’s totally irresponsible to not plan for a terrible contingency like that.\n\nWhy the optimism?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Your book identifies a lot of problems with the Constitution and you’ve talked about some tweaks that could improve it but it’s an optimistic book. Why are you optimistic?\n\nKOWAL: I’m optimistic because the story of the Constitution is a story of progressive change and improvement. It comes in fits and starts. It can be too cumbersome. It can be too slow. But we have made tremendous changes in the Constitution. The 19th Amendment was the largest enfranchisement in history where women were able to vote. The income tax amendment had a profound effect on laying the foundation for a modern American, with a government strong enough to solve our problems. If we just focus on the story of the framers, who were both remarkably progressive, but also created a document that was fundamentally flawed, and they were they were just products of their time. If we only think of the Constitution that way, then it’s dispiriting. But if you focus on the tremendous story of movement, and gadflies, and unlikely politicians and others who said we can have a better Constitution, I draw a lot of inspiration from that.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The group is still active and is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nThe plaque is displayed at the entrance of West Point's science center. The Naming Commission\n\nThe commission urged the Secretary of Defense “to address DoD assets that highlight the K.K.K.” and “create a standard disposition requirement for such assets,” the report states.\n\n“The marker falls outside the remit of the Commission; however, there are clearly ties in the K.K.K. to the Confederacy,” the report states.\n\nThe marker that includes the words Ku Klux Klan is a part of a larger piece of artwork, called a triptych, that appears at the entrance of Barrett Hall, the campus’s Science building. The triptych “references the history of the United States as told in bronze relief,” and has three panels, that are each 11 feet by 5 feet, the Academy’s Public Affairs office said in a statement.\n\nThe part of the artwork that shows the Ku Klux Klan member is in a “small section” on the second panel titled “One Nation, Under God, Indivisible.” The artwork, dedicated in 1965, was “originally dedicated to West Point graduates who served in World War II and Korea,” the statement added.\n\nAccording to the Academy’s Public Affairs office, the triptych’s late sculptor, Laura Gardin Fraser, “wanted to create art that depicted ‘historical incidents or persons’ that symbolized the principled events of that time, thereby documenting both tragedy and triumph in our nation’s history.”\n\n“West Point does not accept, condone, or promote racism, sexism, or any other biases. The Academy continues to graduate its most diverse classes ever with respect to ethnicity, gender, experience, and background,” the Public Affairs office said in the statement.\n\nThe US Military Academy’s Public Affairs office acknowledged they had received the naming commission’s report and said they are “reviewing the recommendations,” in an earlier statement Wednesday.\n\n“We are reviewing the recommendations and will collaborate with the Department of the Army to implement changes, once approved,” the statement said. “West Point’s mission is to develop leaders of character who internalize Army Values, the ideals of Duty, Honor, Country, and the Army Ethic. As a values-based institution, we are fully committed to creating a climate where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.”\n\nThe renaming of bases with Confederate monikers has been a years-long process. It first became a hot button political issue in the final months of the Trump administration, when then-President Donald Trump blasted the idea, accusing others of wanting to “throw those names away.”\n\nThe commission was established in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump vetoed. In the waning days of his administration, Congress delivered its first and only veto override during his tenure, approving the legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n\nOutside of the KKK plaque, the commission identified 12 assets with Confederate name associations that should be renamed at West Point and three assets at the US Naval Academy.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/iranian-journalist-masih-alinejad-man-arrested-ak-47/index.html", "title": "Man with loaded AK-47 arrested near Iranian journalist's Brooklyn ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad on Monday told the Iranian regime, “Go to hell,” just days after authorities informed her a man armed with an AK-47-style rifle was arrested in the Brooklyn neighborhood where she lives with her family, including her stepchildren.\n\nAuthorities are investigating whether the man in custody was there to harm her, a law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAlinejad was targeted in an alleged kidnapping plot by Iranian nationals last year after she spoke out against the Islamic republic.

You’d be wrong. But you wouldn’t be alone in coming to that mistaken conclusion, because the system behind food label dates is an absolute mess.\n\nThere’s no national standard for how those dates should be determined, or how they must be described. Instead, there’s a patchwork system — a hodgepodge of state laws, best practices and general guidelines.\n\n“It is a complete Wild West,” said Dana Gunders, executive director of ReFed, a nonprofit trying to end food waste. And yet, “many consumers really believe that they are being told to throw the food out, or that even when they don’t make that choice, that they’re sort of breaking some rule,” she said.\n\nFor food makers, sell-by dates actually are more about protecting the brand than safety concerns, explained Andy Harig, vice president of sustainability, tax and trade at FMI, a food industry association.\n\nThe sell-by date, often referred to as the expiration date, is the company’s estimate of when a food item will taste best, its optimal date. “You want people to eat and enjoy the product when it’s at its peak, because that’s going to increase their enjoyment, [and] encourage them to buy it again,” he said.\n\nConfused about what food label dates mean? You're not alone. Wang Ying/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe main consequence of this unclear labeling? Food waste. Lots of it.\n\n“Consumer uncertainty about the meaning of the dates … is believed to contribute to about 20 percent of food waste in the home,” the Food and Drug Administration wrote in a 2019 post.\n\nWasted food often ends up in landfills, making it a major contributor to climate change. By some estimates, food loss and waste makes up 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nWasting food also means wasting money, which many consumers can’t afford, especially now as grocery prices soar. And food that is thrown out is diverted from food banks, where it is desperately needed.\n\nThough many companies put dates on their products, baby formula is the only food that is required to have use-by dates in the United States, said Meredith Carothers, a food safety expert with the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nCompanies choose dates based on when they think an item tastes best. But FSIS has its own safety recommendations. Many canned goods can last on shelves for anywhere between one and five years, according to the agency, if properly stored. Under the right conditions, packages of rice and dried pasta can last about two years. The FDA offers food storage tips and guidelines on its website.\n\nBut the rules are wildly different for many perishables.\n\nWhile consuming shelf-stable items after a “best if used by date,” is likely fine, fresh meat and poultry could go bad even before the date on the label. That’s because store refrigerators tend to be colder than our home fridges, explained Carothers.\n\nOnce consumers take meat and poultry home, they should follow home-storage rules, she said. The FSIS instructs people to cook or freeze some meats within two days of bringing them home from the store.\n\nHow we got here\n\nManufacturers began printing sell-by information on products in the early 20th century. At first, the date was written in code: Retail employees had to match each code to a date using a key, but to customers the codes were incomprehensible.\n\nIn the 1970s, grocery shoppers clamored for more information about the quality of food on supermarket shelves. Under pressure from activists, including the distribution of pamphlets deciphering sell-by codes, food makers began to put dates on their labels.\n\nAt first, this “open dating” tactic appeared to be working.\n\nIn February 1973, The New York Times ran an article headlined “Food Dating is Found to Please Customers and Reduce Losses.” The piece pointed to a study conducted by the USDA and the Consumer Research Institute, a group backed by food manufacturers, which concluded that open dating had slashed by half the number of consumer complaints of purchasing stale or spoiled food.\n\nFood manufactures started sharing sell-by dates with consumers about 50 years ago. Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nBut by the end of the decade, those examining the system were less convinced of its merits.\n\nA 1979 study by the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment noted that open dating may not have been the right way to quell consumer fears.\n\n“There is little evidence to support or to negate the contention that there is a direct relationship between open shelf-life dating and the actual freshness of food,” the study found.\n\nThere’s no way to “accurately determine dates for various products, no consensus on which type of date or dates … to use for which product, or even which products to date at all, and no real guidelines as to how to display the date,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nDecades later, we’re still in the same boat. “​​There are no uniform or universally accepted descriptions used on food labels for open dating in the United States,” according to the USDA’s current guidance.\n\nThe FDA said that manufacturers can’t place false or misleading information on labels, but that “they are not required to obtain agency approval of the voluntary quality-based date labels they use or specify how they arrived at the date they’ve applied.” Carothers, from the FSIS, reiterated that dates can be applied as long as they don’t mislead customers and comply with the service’s labeling regulations.\n\nWhere we go next: The sniff test\n\nTo avoid food waste, some advocates encourage people to rely on their senses when determining whether certain foods are safe to eat.\n\nThe British retailer Morrisons said early this year that it is removing “sell by” dates from some of its branded milk, switching instead to “best before” dates and encouraging customers to decide whether to discard the product based on how it looks and smells.\n\nMorrisons offered these guidelines to consumers: if it looks curdled or smells sour, ditch it. If it looks and smells okay, you can consume it even after the date.\n\nMorrisons said this year that it is eliminating dates from its branded milks in some markets. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“When food is decayed past the point where we’d want to eat it, our defenses work very well,” said ReFed’s Gunders. “If food doesn’t look good, if it doesn’t smell good, if it doesn’t taste good, if it’s slimy … then absolutely, we should not eat that food.”\n\nIn general, Gunders recommended that those who are concerned about food safety remain strict about consuming food before the sell-by date if it has a “higher potential to carry listeria.” One way to identify those items? They’re the foods that pregnant women are told to stay away from, she said.\n\nAnother way to prevent confusion, experts say, is to regulate the language used to describe these dates.\n\n“Best by” versus “Use by”\n\nThe Food Date Labeling Act of 2021, introduced in December of last year, wants manufacturers to use “use by,” or “best if used by” only before dates on labels. The bill is the latest in a series of legislative efforts to make a national labeling standard.\n\nHere’s the logic: Companies that decide to put a date on labels have to make clear to consumers whether the item is potentially unsafe after that date, or if it just tastes a little off. If it’s a safety issue, they have to use “use by.” If it’s about food quality, “best if used by” is the way to go.\n\nGunders and agencies like the FDA and USDA point to this label harmonization as a good solution. Many companies have already made the transition.\n\nDel Monte, which sells canned fruits and vegetables among other products, uses “best if used by.” In an email, the company explained that the dates “are a guideline.” Dole, which has dates on its packaged salads, also uses the “best if used by” label.\n\nEven if the bill becomes law and all companies make the same changes, there will still be a missing piece of the puzzle: Alerting consumers to the shift and what it means.\n\nAfter all, consumers who pick up an item today won’t necessarily know that “use by” is distinct from “best if used by,” or if either of those are different from something like “enjoy by,” or “sell by.”\n\nTo make the dates clearer to the public, there needs to be a “consistent and engaged effort to help consumers think through this,” said FMI’s Harig. “I think it’s going to take some work to figure it out.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business-food/starbucks-cup-sustainability/index.html", "title": "Starbucks is planning to phase out its iconic cups | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nStarbucks has a love-hate relationship with its cups.\n\nThe company’s white — or sometimes holiday-themed — logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that’s not entirely a good thing.\n\n“Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,” said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. “But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.”\n\nThat’s because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option — recyclable items still end up in landfills.\n\nThe best solution? “Eliminating the disposable cup,” Kobori said. He called that option “the holy grail.”\n\nThe traditional Starbucks disposable cup. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit.\n\nStarbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru.\n\nThe goals don’t mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won’t be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan.\n\nTesting out Borrow-A-Cup programs\n\nExamples of Starbucks' reusable cups. Courtesy Starbucks Coffee Company\n\nTo phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use.\n\nAmelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts.\n\n“I think that will take the lead,” she said. “We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,” including “20 different iterations and in eight different markets.”\n\nIn Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\n\n“We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,” Landers explained.\n\nFor that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.\n\nKim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.\n\n“The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],” she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough — they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn’t have to worry about that part of the process.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe model is the most promising because it’s the easiest to integrate into customers’ daily lives.\n\nYou don’t have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don’t need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don’t have time for on a weekday morning.\n\nBut that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways.\n\nBringing back the personal cup\n\nStarbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores.

It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive.\n\n“We’re testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today — from 10 cents to 50 cents,” Landers said. “We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.” She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores.\n\nThat’s simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app.\n\nYears ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.\n\nDuring a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks’ drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.\n\nSo to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead.\n\nTo that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center.\n\n“We’ve got mock stores set up,” said Landers. “We have different versions of the drive-thru layout.”\n\nCustomers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother.\n\nOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores.\n\nThe team is trying “different things, over and over again,” to figure out what might work, she said. “We’re right now in the middle of all of that work.”\n\nIt’s crucial for Starbucks’ mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds.\n\nThat’s especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company’s leadership.\n\nA Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.\n\nIf the company’s initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.\n\n“We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don’t change their behavior all that easily,” Landers said. “Even though they really, really want to.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}

The flights begin in late June and early July with one way introductory fares ranging from $29 to $59.\n\nThe new flights, announced on the airline's first anniversary, are in addition to seven new routes from Avelo's growing base in New Haven, Connecticut, which were announced earlier this year and begin in May.

He said Orlando, which the airline already serves from New Haven, is a natural choice for more summer flights as it remains popular in the summer while interest in other Florida destinations falls off. The airline will offer new flights to Orlando from Charleston, Baltimore and Wilmington.\n\n“It's just such a huge destination,” he said.\n\nWilmington, North Carolina, is attractive because it's a growing second home and retirement community, Levy said.

Two-time WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne played there as well.\n\n“The opportunity to join Conference USA is a very proud moment for our entire university,” athletic director Chrissi Rawak said. “With this step forward, we will continue to offer an incredible student-athlete experience and elevate the visibility of all that is remarkable about UD.\"\n\nThe Blue Hens currently play in the Coastal Athletic Association. The CAA, which changed its name earlier this year from the Colonial Athletic Association, had 15 teams in football this season. The league lost James Madison after the 2021 season, and the Dukes’ transition to the FBS has gone so well they reached the AP Top 25 this year.\n\nUMass, Old Dominion and Georgia State are a few other former CAA programs that now play in the FBS.\n\nDelaware will compete in Conference USA in baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, cross-country, football, men’s and women’s golf, women’s soccer, softball, men’s and women’s tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The school said there would be more information in the months ahead about where its other programs will compete. The Blue Hens reached the NCAA Tournament in men's lacrosse last season and nearly upset top-seeded Duke.\n\nDelaware's most recent FCS football title came in 2003, and it has reached the championship game twice since then. The Blue Hens beat Lafayette last weekend in the FCS playoffs. Coach Ryan Carty's team plays at Montana in the second round this weekend.\n\nDelaware's varsity programs will stay in the CAA through the 2024-25 season, and all of them except football will remain eligible to compete for conference championships and the NCAA postseason. Football is not eligible for a conference title or the FCS playoffs once its transition to the FBS begins after this season.\n\nThe school said its 2024 football team will play an FCS schedule. It will be in Conference USA the following year, but won't be eligible to play in the league championship game until 2026.\n\nThe football team plays at 22,000-seat Delaware Stadium.\n\n\"We are confident that we have the infrastructure in place at UD to compete with the very best in college football and simultaneously witness the growth of our other intercollegiate programs in the department,” Rawak said. “UD Athletics continues to ascend, and Blue Hen football is prepared to take the next step and lead the way.”\n\nFBS football requires extra scholarships, and with gender equity in mind, Delaware said it will be adding another women's varsity sport that will be announced later.\n\n___\n\nAP College Football Writer Ralph D.

That’s among 230 public schools in statistics compiled by USA Today.\n\nLittle Delaware isn’t such a lightweight, apparently, when it comes to splurging on sports in a bid to become more relevant in its conference and even nationally. Delaware allocates a greater amount of university-derived money toward athletics than most schools.\n\nBlue Hens teams did begin to turn the corner in 2019-20, logging a 147-99-4 record before the coronavirus pandemic forced a premature end to winter and spring athletics in March.\n\nCLASSES TO RESUME: UD announces fall semester plans, changes\n\nThe $38.23 million in athletic funding that came directly from the institution in 2017-18, the most recent school year for which information is available, was considerably more than any of Delaware’s FCS counterparts, according to the Knight Commission.\n\nNext, were conference football rivals Rhode Island ($20.48 million) and Stony Brook ($17.22 million).\n\n“They stand out because there was an investment,” Rawak said of those financial figures. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with that, especially if we are producing.\"\n\nBut is that investment too significant?\n\nOnly one FBS athletic program received more in government/institutional support – the United States Air Force Academy ($39.8 million), according to the Knight Commission's 2017-18 data.\n\nThe subject came up last fall at a UD board of trustees’ committee on student life and athletics summit. Meeting minutes describe “a robust discussion” on the topic of spending “finite” resources on athletics and concerns about “the potential return” on the investment.\n\nIt was initiated by Matt Robinson, head of the UD sport management program who had been the interim athletic director in the first half of 2016 before Rawak’s hiring. Robinson had raised concerns about the university’s considerable subsidization of athletics with Rawak during the meeting.\n\nWhile acknowledging the discussion took place, Robinson, who is also UD Faculty Senate president, preferred not to comment further on the topic when recently asked by Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nAssanis had responded to Robinson’s concerns by expressing that he and other university presidents share the wish “to elevate their institutions through success in athletics,” meeting minutes reported.\n\nSurely, sports accomplishments are attention-getters that can fuel enrollment and fund-raising, though UD’s strong academic reputation and picturesque campus have long been powerful lures in their own right.\n\nRawak described athletics as “a window to the broader public” that could “drive the success of the entire university,” according to board of trustees meeting minutes.\n\nBut college athletics is also a costly venture.\n\nDivision I schools away from the Power Five bloc, which includes the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC and Pac-12 with their lucrative TV packages and wealthy donors, have a particularly difficult time finding outside funding sources.\n\nALL IN: CAA announces all teams will qualify for postseason tournaments\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has cast additional light on those high costs and athletic spending often viewed as frivolous, such as coaches’ salaries, staffing, scheduling and travel, especially from far-flung conference alignment. It has forced many to rethink their approaches and ensure spending is efficient and frugal.\n\nIn April, UD announced the pandemic had left it with a $65 million overall budget shortfall because of the switch to online learning after students were sent home and all university events were canceled in mid-March.\n\nAthletic financial losses were not severe but certainly impactful, Rawak suggested. The only cuts announced so far affecting athletics have been some part-time positions. Staff development, travel and scheduling are areas where budgets will be trimmed, Rawak said.\n\nThe basketball teams staying overnight at hotels before games at nearby Drexel and Towson and the football team sleeping in a hotel the night before home games are potential cost-cutting targets. This fall, the soccer, volleyball and field hockey teams are playing fewer games that involve significantly less travel.\n\n\"We're in a different time now,\" Rawak said of COVID-19's impact on college athletics and the need to adjust.\n\nA slew of Division I schools have recently dropped sports: Old Dominion (wrestling); Cincinnati (men’s soccer); Furman (baseball and men’s lacrosse); Central Michigan (men’s track and field); Akron (men’s cross country, men’s golf, women’s tennis); East Carolina (men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s swimming); Florida International (men’s indoor track); Appalachian State (men’s soccer, men’s indoor and outdoor track and men’s tennis); Wright State (men’s and women’s tennis and softball); Connecticut (men's cross country, swimming and tennis and women's rowing); and Brown (11 sports). Before those cuts, Brown's 38 teams were more than any school nationally except Harvard and Stanford.\n\nExcept for FCS-level Furman and Brown and non-football playing Wright State, all are FBS schools in Group of Five conferences. Commissioners from that collection of leagues, which do not reap the economic windfall of Power Five schools, recently requested a reduction in the NCAA requirement that they field a minimum of 16 teams. The NCAA Division I Council denied it.\n\nDelaware, which fields 21 athletic teams, had $44.32 million in athletic funding and expenses in the most recent 2017-18 fiscal review, according to the Knight Commission, including that $38.23 million in university backing. The $44.32 million was the figure that ranked 70th nationally in USA Today’s accounting.\n\nBy contrast, 34 football-playing schools from the FBS Mid-American Conference, Conference USA and Sun Belt Conference – all in that Group of Five – had lower operating expenses on athletics than Delaware, including sport-killers Central Michigan, Akron, FIU and Appalachian State.\n\nFBS schools may award 85 football scholarships compared with 63 for FCS schools such as Delaware, a significant additional expense.\n\nRawak, however, dismissed the Knight Commission math, claiming it gives a false impression that, she said, makes Delaware stand out more than it should in relation to its Division I peers.\n\nFor example, she said, sports medicine operates out of the Carpenter Center and is counted as part of the funding supporting athletics but is actually overseen by UD Student Health.\n\nShe also said some schools do not count the significant cost of athletic facility groundskeeping, as Delaware does, in figures given to the Knight Commission.\n\n“How everybody counts money is very different,” she said, including scholarships in those accounting variances. “It creates more questions.”\n\nThe Knight Commission, founded in 1989, is a panel of experts in education and athletics that aims to ensure college sports function within the academic framework of the institutions. The Collegiate Athletics Financial Information Database aims to improve the accountability of public Division I institutions by making their spending and earning more transparent.\n\nDREAM COMES TRUE: UD pitcher Sullivan signs with Phillies\n\n“I would guarantee you there are a lot of universities that are supported the way we are but they don’t count it so it’s not an accurate interpretation,” Rawak said, adding that includes fellow Colonial Athletic Association members.\n\nIn an email response to questions, Amy Perko, the Knight Commission’s chief executive officer, wrote that “the NCAA has made changes over the years to improve definitions and comparability but there may continue to be differences in how institutions report the data.\"\n\n\"That said,\" she added, \"these audited reports represent the most accurate athletics financial reports available and the data are used by the NCAA to produce ‘dashboard metrics’ that institutional leaders use to assess their athletic programs’ financial health. These institutional data are rarely seen by the public.”\n\nThe Knight Commission employs financial data that schools are required to submit to the NCAA that is “subject to agreed-upon procedures performed by a qualified independent accountant,” according to the commission, and approved by university presidents or chancellors.\n\nPerko added that “the Knight Commission has always believed that – at their best – intercollegiate sports provide important educational opportunities for college athletes and benefits for the entire university community. We also believe that more effective disclosure of finances – and of financial priorities – will enhance the long-term prospects of college sports by ensuring they remain part of, not apart from, the core mission of universities.’’\n\nMajor increase in athletic spending\n\nWhatever differences there may be between how schools do their accounting, there is no doubt Delaware has seen a huge increase in athletic expenditures and university support since Assanis and Rawak appeared in the spring of 2016.\n\nFor the 2015-16 school year, the last before they arrived, Delaware had $34.31 million in athletics funding, with $28.05 million, or 82%, coming from UD coffers.\n\nIn just two years, Delaware’s annual spending on athletics increased $10 million, all provided by the university.\n\n“I was looking for the best person to take the athletics program here to the next level,” Assanis said when Rawak was hired. “ ... The first thing we need to be is the best within the [Colonial Athletic Association].”\n\nRawak, who came to Delaware from the University of Michigan, was determined to build a stronger foundation upon which championship seasons could be constructed. Assanis provided the financial resources, with the board of trustees’ support.\n\n“If you were to look at each of the different programs and how they’ve achieved, my answer would be ‘Yes,’” Rawak said when asked if Delaware was making good on that investment. “They’re all in different places.”\n\nBLUE HENS BACK: First group returns to use athletic facilities\n\nIn that board of trustees' committee on student life and athletics meeting, Rawak described her intentions to make Delaware a “Cinderella story” in college athletics, suggesting the Blue Hens had to rise from wretched depths to reach championship heights. It’s why her strategic plan for athletics is titled “Project Glass Slipper.”\n\nIn actuality, Delaware seems miscast for that role.\n\nThe Blue Hens have hardly been viewed by collegiate counterparts as forlorn or deserving pity despite the ups and downs of their teams, making the rags-to-riches fairy-tale comparison suspect. Delaware has often been held in high regard by sporting peers, though many would agree that its teams could fare better overall in the conference.\n\nIn the few years before Rawak came, UD women’s basketball teams, thanks to Elena Delle Donne’s presence, went to the 2012 and 2013 NCAA tournaments. Their male counterparts followed in 2014.\n\nMen’s soccer, having not reached NCAA play since 1970, made the 2011 and 2013 NCAA brackets. Field hockey began its run of CAA titles and NCAA berths in 2013. Women’s track won the 2014 CAA title.\n\nBefore that, the football team reached national title games in 2003, 2007 and 2010, winning the first. Men’s lacrosse was in four NCAA tournaments from 2005-11, including a Final Four appearance in 2007; and volleyball made four NCAA trips from 2007-11.\n\nBut to enhance its championship chances, Delaware has spent more.\n\n\"It's allowing us to do something really special here for what I believe is a really special place and has the ability to achieve,\" Rawak said.\n\nOLYMPIC STAND RESONATES: Smith's, Carlos' 1968 protest still goes unheeded\n\nJMU, which has five fewer teams and 100 fewer athletes than Delaware, had $51.72 million in funding for 2017-18 with $41.7 million from institutional/government sources, most from mandatory fees imposed on students.\n\nThe USA Today data reveals FBS members Air Force Academy ($40.2 million) and Connecticut ($39 million) as the only others allocating more university-derived funds for athletics than Delaware.\n\nDelaware receives 86.25% of its athletic funding from the university, ranking it ninth among the 230 Division I schools in the USA Today compilation. Among the eight ahead of Delaware was CAA rival Towson (87.17%).\n\nThough it comes under the heading of “institutional/government support,” UD officials insist the university, not state taxpayers, provides the economic sustenance for Blue Hens sports. The Senate Joint Finance Committee approved $125 million in 2020-21 annual funding for UD on June 5.\n\nState Rep. John Kowalko, whose 25th district includes UD's campus, doubts the contention that taxpayer dollars are not being used to support athletics.\n\n“I’m saying, ‘Prove it,’” Kowalko said. “That money could be intermingled dramatically. … Until they agree they are willing to support the repeal of their FOIA, so I can look at these numbers, I don’t believe them.”\n\nKowalko was referring to the University of Delaware being exempt from state records laws, including most Freedom of Information Act requests. That means the university does not need to provide the public with details of its accounting.\n\n“I believe that they are co-mingling taxpayer money,” Kowalko added, suggesting some operational dollars from the state likely do support athletics. “It’s the same pot of soup.”\n\nIn response to a FOIA request submitted by The News Journal seeking more data on athletic funding, UD's associate vice president and deputy general counsel, Jennifer M. Becnel-Guzzo, wrote the “athletic department is not supported with public funds. Therefore, the university has no public records responsive to your request.”\n\nWhile one UD athletic official did compare Delaware’s institutional funding to those required student fees charged at JMU and many other schools, such as UConn, Rawak said that is not correct.\n\nShe said athletic funding comes from general university resources that are drawn from various reserves but that students and their families are “not paying for athletics.”\n\nDelaware also spent $11.77 million on athletic aid for its 600-plus student-athletes in 2017-18, according to the Knight Report. That’s roughly $20,000 per student-athlete.\n\nNEW APPROACH: COVID forces recruiting changes for Rocco\n\nUD’s $1.4 billion endowment does not pay for athletics and is presently not a viable source, Rawak said. But endowing components of athletics as a funding mechanism is a goal, she added.\n\nTuition and fees have typically risen about 4% annually for UD students, increasing $600 to $14,280 for in-state undergraduates in 2019-20 and $1,400 to $35,710 for their out-of-state counterparts.\n\n\"We don't use that to fund athletics,\" Rawak said, adding that the university has numerous income sources beyond student payments.\n\nSeveral UD faculty members not authorized to speak on behalf of the university or the athletic department, as well as those with knowledge of the subject outside the school, disputed Rawak's contention students are not helping to foot the bill for athletics, however.\n\nDavid Ridpath, an Ohio University sports management professor, agrees that “athletic programs at colleges and universities have value.” He is president of the board of directors for the Drake Group, which has a mission “to defend academic integrity in higher education from the corrosive aspects of commercialized college sports.”\n\n“But that value is often overstated and used as an excuse to spend more,” he told The News Journal, “such as when apologists claim that athletic success influences enrollment, donations, etc. when the evidence on that is mixed at best.\n\n“So it becomes a perpetual cycle of trying to be something you are not, and chasing someone else who is likely spending money they don’t have. A school can have a successful athletic program without continuing to spend more and more where likely the end game is exactly the same as when they started.”\n\nChanging to spur success\n\nPart of Rawak’s efforts to improve UD athletic fortunes has included changing head coaches in 12 of Delaware’s 21 varsity sports.\n\nThe seven conference titles Delaware has won since Rawak came – three in field hockey (2016, 2017 and 2019) and one each in men’s soccer (2016), baseball (2017), women’s golf (2017) and women’s outdoor track and field (2019) – were all by teams with head coaches who were here before Rawak’s arrival.\n\nIn 2016, Delaware also won the NCAA field hockey title.\n\n“If you were to look at the successes of our programs, collectively, all of them, one of the things to recognize is, Rome wasn’t built in a day,” said Rawak, who is frequently lauded by staff for her positive approach and leadership. “It takes time.\"\n\nThe 2019-20 school year was, by far, Delaware’s most successful recently from a won-loss standpoint before the shutdown.\n\nThe previous three, Blue Hen squads went 189-188-2 in 2016-17, 170-184-6 in 2017-18 and 162-200-3 last year. Along with that CAA women’s track title, the 2018-19 season did feature the return to the national rankings by the men’s lacrosse team.\n\nThe 147-99-4 record in 2019-20 was a dramatic improvement and likely reflected some new coaches reaping the benefits of their programs getting re-established.\n\nIn addition to more field hockey success, this school year featured a 22-11 record in men’s basketball, its best in six seasons; women’s soccer had its highest finish, second place, in 18 Colonial Athletic Association seasons and most wins (12) since 1994; women’s cross-country was a best-ever second in the CAA meet; men’s tennis was 14-1 with a chance at the winningest season in school history when it ended prematurely; softball was 19-4, equaling its best start ever, at the time spring sports were halted.\n\nOther sports, however, such as football – long the university’s pride and joy – and women’s basketball, struggled to regain past glories.\n\nLEARNING FROM LEGENDS: QBs enjoy video meetings with Blue Hen greats\n\nAfter ending a seven-year NCAA football playoff absence in 2018, Delaware went 5-7 last fall, its third under coach Danny Rocco. Despite a veteran lineup, women’s basketball was 12-17 under third-year coach Natasha Adair.\n\nAmong recent athletic upgrades at Delaware have been devoting more resources toward sports such as swimming, tennis, golf, cross-country and track, which were once designated as “low-tier.” Tennis players often supplied their own rackets, and runners received just one pair of shoes for a season.\n\nMuch of Rawak’s approach has gone toward adding staff positions aimed at supporting the athletic mission, such as in heath-, media-, academic- and leadership-related positions.\n\nIn 2015-16, Delaware spent $3.65 million on support and administrative compensation, according to the Knight Commission. Two years later, that figure had nearly doubled to $6.8 million.\n\nThe UD staff directory on BlueHens.com recently listed 219 positions, including 14 involved with recreation programs and intramural activities at Carpenter Sports Building on central campus.\n\nIn contrast, several FBS schools that are close to Delaware in terms of spending list far fewer, such as Conference USA’s Old Dominion (166), Mountain West member Wyoming (186) and the MAC’s Buffalo (193).\n\nThe University of Delaware does not reveal salaries of its coaches or athletic administrators, even though some are among the First State’s highest-paid employees.\n\nIn doing so, UD cites its status as a state-assisted yet privately chartered and governed institution. Taxpayer dollars do typically account for roughly 10% of the university’s annual operating budget.\n\nThe university's IRS Form 990, which is made public, does list the highest compensated employees.\n\nIt is known that Rocco was the third-highest paid UD employee in 2017, according to the most recently available IRS Form 990, with total compensation of $609,167. Rawak ranked seventh at $480,046.\n\nBoth have taken 5% pay cuts, along with Adair and men’s basketball coach Martin Ingelsby, as part of COVID-19 money-saving measures.\n\nRidpath, the Ohio University professor, termed Delaware’s institutional and government support “a significant amount of money that could have been used for other things to support the educational mission, but Delaware made a choice.”\n\nBut was it the right choice?\n\n“For Delaware, that is pretty high of an amount,” Ridpath said. “There are many disadvantages, not the least of which is aptly explained as robbing Peter to pay Paul. I don’t think some funding like this is inherently bad but this amount is too much considering where the money is coming from.\n\n“... The real danger is schools like Delaware that don’t generate enough revenue [income] still increasing spending. The question is why and how that impacts university?”\n\nNew financial sources surface\n\nThe huge financial impact athletics has on a college is not new.\n\nIn his 1918 tome “The Higher Learning in America,” economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote: “College sports come in for ever increasing attention and take an increasingly prominent and voluminous place in the university’s life.”\n\nHe warned collegiate athletics was “earnestly pushed by the businesslike authorities” even though, he added, “it is the most widely out of touch with all learning.”\n\nThese are modern-day arguments as well, though UD athletes tend to perform better academically than their counterparts. Ten teams had perfect scores in 2018-19 in the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, which measures academic eligibility and retention of scholarship athletes over a four-year period.\n\nIn the introduction to his 2019 book, Intercollegiate Athletics Inc., George Mason University economics and public policy professor James T. Bennett wrote that collegiate athletic programs have become “gargantuan, taxpayer-supported spectacles that now dominate many public universities.”\n\nOf Delaware pulling so much of its athletic revenue from institutional sources, Bennett said, “That’s not revenue at all. Revenues come from ticket sales and paraphernalia sales. This isn’t revenue.”\n\nIt’s actually a subsidy that’s granted, in this case, by the university.\n\n“The whole thing is a scam, very candidly,” Bennett said. “I mean, what’s the purpose of the university? I thought it was education.”\n\n“Highest-paid guy is some loser coach,” added Bennett, who was speaking generally not specifically about anyone at Delaware. “What does it say about priorities? Spending tens of million dollars on programs with zero academic value. This is unheard of throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Think of how you could divert that money.”\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION: Howard starter Prince transfers to Delaware\n\nDelaware has shown the potential to tap into other monetary resources, however.\n\nOne of Delaware’s biggest victories off the field in recent years, for all to see, did come in fundraising, though there was a substantial cost to the university as well.\n\nIn a campaign separate from normal athletic support involving capital funds, UD contributed $25 million toward the $60 million project to refurbish the west grandstand of Delaware Stadium and build the adjoining Whitney Athletic Center.\n\nThe other $35 million was raised through private donations, including a $10 million gift from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth. The nearly two-year project is slated to be concluded late this summer.\n\nThe easy transmission of the coronavirus between people, which has led to social-distancing standards, jeopardizes the immediate future of crowded assemblies and the financial rewards that come with them, however. Delaware has not yet announced how it will handle or limit football crowds this season.\n\nUD has other facility improvements it would like to tackle, including updating the east stands at Delaware Stadium and a complete modernization of the window-less Delaware Field House. The Delaware Stadium/Whitney Athletic Center project demonstrated there are potential outside financial resources for athletics.\n\n“The fundraising we did here,” Rawak said during a tour of Delaware Stadium, “was a significantly positive sign that people believe in the vision and are invested in it.\"\n\nOfficials also visualize Delaware Stadium as a greater potential revenue generator by using it as a site for large-scale events, much the way the Carpenter Center is a setting for concerts, graduations and other gatherings beyond UD games. Placing a temporary public ice-skating rink inside Delaware Stadium in the winter, for instance, and even playing hockey games there has been proposed.\n\nThe athletic department received just $710,000 from donor contributions in 2017-18, below the FCS median, according to the Knight Commission (Donations for the Delaware Stadium/Whitney Center project count separately because they're for a capital project not athletic expenses).\n\nWith the exception of several Historically Black Colleges and Universities, most FCS schools had a larger percentage of their revenue from those sources than Delaware.\n\nIn marked contrast, perennial FCS football champ North Dakota State pulled in $6.7 million in donor contributions; CAA rival William & Mary, $5.8 million; Missouri State, $4.7 million; football power Montana State, $4.2 million; and JMU, $2.5 million.\n\nWith schools having to rein in athletic costs because of COVID-19’s impact, Delaware faces a stiff challenge in its continued effort to improve its sports fortunes while also being fiscally fit and tuned in to important social issues.\n\n“I don’t resent that fact that they are trying to make major sports programs prominent for this university,” Kowalko said, “but is it at the cost of academics? Is it at the cost of integrating the school when they talk about diversity?”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

They appear to be an even more imposing foe this year.\n\nNonetheless, Delaware will relish the opportunity, which begins our five takeaways from Saturday’s 56-17 first-round FCS win over Saint Francis at Delaware Stadium.\n\n“Now we’ve got a tall task,” coach Ryan Carty said.\n\nJackrabbits next\n\nSouth Dakota State may be better now than it was in May of 2021, when it dominated Delaware. The top-ranked and No. 1-seeded Jackrabbits (10-1) have won 10 straight since a 7-3 loss to Big Ten Iowa. That includes a 23-21 win at Missouri Valley Football Conference rival and defending FCS champ North Dakota State.\n\n“We’re competitors, right?” Henderson said. “We want to go against the best. Right now, they’re number one in the country so we get a shot at that and we feel like, when we play our best ball, we can play any team in the country and beat any team in the country.”\n\nDelaware treasures the chance to visit them at Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium, despite the difficulties the Hens had there last time. South Dakota State scored on four straight first-half possessions to take a 27-3 halftime and piled up 354 total yards against a Hens defense that had allowed an average of 223 per game.\n\nHenderson missed a first-half series after hurting his knee but completed 18 of 21 passes for 142 yards. But South Dakota State set a school record with seven sacks against a banged up Blue Hens offensive line and Delaware couldn’t muster much of a running attack.\n\nA week later, Sam Houston, with Carty coordinating the offense, beat the Jackrabbits in the FCS title game 23-21.\n\n“They’re really good at what they do,” Carty said. “They don’t do a ton on defense. They are just so good.”\n\nNCAA BRACKET: First-round final scores\n\nBut Carty said having coaches and players with experience taking on such a tough challenge helps.\n\n“We’re about to go into not only playing the best team in the country, playing in one of the toughest environments in the country,” Carty said. “So you’re gonna need people who have been in those experiences, those venues, so that things don’t overwhelm you too much. When things go wrong it’s OK, we can fight back.”\n\nNumbers game\n\nThe eight wins are the most since Delaware’s 12-3 NCAA runner-up season of 2010.\n\nHenderson’s four touchdown passes, three of which went to Chandler Harvin, gave him 32 this season, breaking Matt Nagy’s single-season UD record of 29 set for the 12-2 NCAA semifinal team in 2000, when Delaware was still running a souped-up version of the Wing-T.\n\nThyrick Pitts, who caught the other TD pass, now has a reception in 42 straight games dating back to the start of the 2019 season. That ties Nihja White’s school record set from 2009-12.\n\nJohnny Buchanan became the 20th member of Delaware’s 300-tackle club, getting 15 to put his career total at 313, which ranks 14th.\n\nFOR STARTERS:Ranking Delaware's memorable first-round NCAA football playoffs\n\nSaturday was Carty’s 35th FCS playoff game, including six as a Delaware player in 2003 and 2004, 22 while coaching at New Hampshire and six during his stint on the Sam Houston staff.\n\nAttendance, always much lower for postseason than regular-season games, was a particularly paltry 4,629.\n\nGround up\n\nDelaware gained 283 yards running the football Saturday, easily a season high, topping the 231 at Rhode Island.\n\nKyron Cumby had 111, surpassing his season-high 100 from the Towson game. Marcus Yarns had 85, bettered only by the 99 he had against Delaware State.\n\n“That’s pretty awesome,” Carty said. “We preach balance, we like it. Today we were fairly balanced. I think that’s something we’re gonna need to continue to do if we want to make a run.”\n\nBEST OF THE BEST:Delaware's best 16 teams of all time\n\nOn the rebound\n\nDelaware was coming off excruciating losses to Richmond 21-13 and Villanova 29-26 that could have prevented it from even making the 24-team FCS bracket.\n\nBut the Blue Hens were in the field and made the most of it, no doubt bringing with them chips on their padded shoulders from those games.\n\n“We stuck together,” Carty said, crediting the team leaders and coaches for trying to learn from those losses and be better for it.\n\nWith school closed all week for Thanksgiving break, the team had a better chance to unite in that effort, Carty suggested, to “get into a new season here and just wipe it clean, wipe what happened before. It’s what got us here, but it doesn’t have to define us.”\n\nDelaware still had three turnovers Saturday, including A.I. du Pont High grad Kerry Galloway's interception for Saint Francis, providing a few more lessons to learn from.\n\nNo Red Flash in the pan\n\nSaint Francis came into Saturday’s game No. 8 nationally in FCS scoring 37.6 points per game and 16th with 444.4 yards per game total offense. The Red Flash got just 286 yards against Delaware.\n\nThey’d also allowed just 18.4 points and 310 yards per game. Delaware piled up 586 yards.\n\nCertainly, playing a Colonial Athletic Association foe as opposed to its Northeast Conference competition made for a significant step up, but Delaware was apparently ready.\n\n“That team came in here with energy,” Carty said, “they came in here with confidence and talented football players and we did a nice job in all three phases of stifling them early.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Neither team led by more than seven and there were six ties and six lead changes.\n\n“I do think games like this, like Friday night, really prepare us for conference play,” coach Martin Ingelsby said.\n\nCarter’s 23 points featured nine straight late in the second half and he also had eight rebounds. Both were game highs.\n\nIthiel Horton added 18 points, Darian Bryant supplied 12, Kevin Anderson scored 11 and Matt Veretto’s eight featured a pair of timely 3-pointers.\n\n“That’s hard to beat at the end of the day,” Bryant said of such widespread scoring contributions.\n\nFreshmen Horton and Veretto made their first career starts.\n\n“I thought starting them gives us the most potent offensive group to start the game,” Ingelsby said. “It takes a little pressure off Eric Carter and Kevin Anderson.”\n\nSophomore guard Ryan Allen, the 2018 CAA rookie of the year, remains sidelined until mid-December after an October foot surgery.\n\nDelaware led from late in the first half, including 35-33 at halftime, until Derric Jean’s 3-pointer pushed the Bulldogs ahead 57-56 with 7:18 to go. Oliver Powell’s driving layup then made it 59-56, but Louisiana Tech was called for a technical foul afterward for profanity.\n\nHorton then drained the two free throws and Veretto buried a 3-pointer off Bryant’s assists as the shot clock expired to ignite a 10-2 UD run.\n\n“The one thing I love about this team is we have more weapons than we’ve had,” Ingelsby said.\n\nBack-to-back driving layups by Anderson with 2:44 and 2:21 left extended Delaware’s lead to 72-66. Louisiana Tech failed to score on three straight subsequent possessions.\n\n“Really proud of how we executed on both ends of the floor down the stretch,” Ingelsby said.\n\nEach team shot 55.3 percent (26-for-47) from the field, 3-point aim was nearly even – Delaware was 7-for-16 to the visitors’ 8-for-17 – and Louisiana Tech had just a 23-22 rebound edge. The difference was at the foul line, where Delaware was 16-for-21 to the Bulldogs’ 11-for-11.\n\n“They’re a good team that plays hard,” Bryant said. “They go far in their conference every year, so to be able to get that win at home for us in front our fans was a great confidence booster.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Henderson completed 16 of 23 passes for 266 yards and also ran 13 yards for the Blue Hens' first TD. Chandler Harvin caught three of those TD passes.\n\nThe 56 points tied Delaware's FCS playoff record, coming in a 56-21 first-round win over Samford in 1992.\n\nDelaware's playoff chances had been put in peril after losing 29-26 at Villanova, but the Hens were still deemed worthy and showed why Saturday. Treasuring their postseason opportunity helped spur the Hens.\n\nGAME STATS: Delaware 56, St. Francis 17\n\n\"It was huge motivation,\" said linebacker Johnny Buchanan. \"We felt it. I felt it for a second, playing my last college football game. It hits you at your core. I knew there was a little bit of hope so when I heard 'Delaware' pop up on the screen on Sunday, it was on. It doesn't matter how you get in. It's just about winning and advancing.''\n\nNo. 23-ranked Delaware (8-4) moves on to play at top-seeded South Dakota State (10-1) at 3 p.m. EST in next Saturday's round of 16.\n\nThe Missouri Valley Conference champs, who've won 10 straight since a 7-3 season-opening loss to Big Ten member Iowa, had a first-round bye in the 24-team bracket. It's a return trip for Delaware, which was dominated by the Jackrabbits in Brookings 33-3 in the 2021 spring FCS semifinals.\n\n\"A week ago we didn't think we were gonna make the playoffs,\" Henderson said. \"Now we get to go to the number one team in the country, and nobody believes in us except the guys in that locker room and that excites me.\"\n\nNortheast Conference champion Saint Francis (9-3), making its second FCS playoff appearance, had won nine straight including eight by double digits since losing to FBS Akron in overtime and CAA power Richmond to start the season. Delaware had downed the Red Flash 27-10 in the 2021 fall season home opener.\n\nFOR STARTERS:Ranking Delaware's memorable first-round NCAA football playoffs\n\nThe Blue Hens expected a much tougher encounter this time, but they quickly made Saint Francis appear overmatched.\n\n\"Getting 11 hats to the ball on defense, fitting the right gaps, making plays when the ball's in the air,\" coach Ryan Carty said of what led to Delaware's success. \"Getting some pressure on the quarterback. I thought he never really felt settled, neither of them really did, 4 [starter Cole Doyle] or 13 [replacement Justin Sliwoski]. I think that's important.\"\n\nSaint Francis finished with 259 offensive yards. The two quarterbacks were just 13-for-31 passing and were sacked three times.\n\n\"And then, offensively, again, execution,\" Carty said. \"It's things that we've done. We've been close. I've hated that word. I've said it too many times. We have to go out here and accomplished the mission and I thought today we did a better job of that.\"\n\nThe Red Flash arrived ninth nationally in FCS allowing 310 yards per game. Delaware had 331 at the half and finished with 586 total yards.\n\nThe Blue Hens benefited from a strong running complement. Kyron Cumby's 111 yards on 10 carries and Marcus Yarns' 85 on nine runs.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised,\" said Saint Francis coach Chris Villarrial, the former NFL offensive lineman. \"We knew playing them last year they were a physical team. I think one of the things that really got us early on was the speed of the game. It changed a little bit and it took us a little bit to get caught up and we missed some early balls that could have really changed things, kept the chains going. They kept the offense off the field. We were beat up in that secondary and they exploited it.\"\n\nDelaware scored on its first two series of the game, traveling 75 yards on six plays, then 84 yards on nine snaps. Henderson's 13-yard scramble and his 30-yard pass to Harvin ended those series as it was 14-0 with 4:20 left in the first period.\n\nBEST OF THE BEST:Delaware's best 16 teams of all time\n\nThe first half closed with Henderson passing 5 yards to Thyrick Pitts and 7 to Harvin as Delaware zoomed into halftime ahead 28-3. Henderson's 58-yard touchdown pass to Harvin on Delaware's first series of the third quarter quickly extended the lead to 35-3.\n\n\"They came out ready to go,\" Villarrial said.\n\nSaint Francis also came in 16th nationally in FCS with 444.4 yards in total offense per game. The visitors could only manage a 22-yard field goal in the first half, a third-quarter TD after Delaware had taken command and another late TD.\n\nIt could have been worse.\n\nDelaware had two other first-half series thwarted by fumbles in Saint Francis territory, including one at the goal line, and a third-quarter threat stopped by a A.I. du Pont High graduate Kerry Galloway's interception. That led to Justin Sliwoski's 12-yard TD pass to Dawson Snyder that cut the Hens' lead to 35-10 with 4:04 left in the third period.\n\nBut the Blue Hens then tacked on Quincy Watson's 1-yard TD run to close a 10-play, 60-yard drive with 14:09 left to go up 42-10. It became 49-10 with 6:01 left on Khory Spruill's 10-yard TD run set up by Ryan O'Connor's 37-yard pass to Smyrna High grad Mahki Jackson.\n\nConcord High grad Brandon Dennis then recovered a fumble on the kick-off in the end zone for the final UD touchdown that made it 56-10 before Saint Francis added a late TD on a 5-play, 75-yard series.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Steele resigned as Thundering Herd coach in July.\n\nSteele replaces John Seneca, who was dismissed after three-plus seasons in May.\n\nThe prize of Seneca’s recruiting class, Georgia All-American third baseman/pitcher Kassidy Krupit, was released from her UD Letter of Intent and signed with Baylor.\n\nSeneca was Delaware’s coach for three full seasons, plus the last 17 games of the 2015 season after he was elevated from his associate head coach position when Jamie Wohlbach was fired. Delaware went 81-89 overall and 28-41 in the Colonial Athletic Association under Seneca.\n\nDelaware was 18-31 overall and 8-13 in the CAA in 2018, finished tied for fifth and didn’t make the conference tournament.

But they also understand how difficult the task is, having also been seeded first in last year’s CAA Tournament and winning just once in three games.\n\nThe Hens have won just one league tournament ever in softball, that coming way back in 1984 in the East Coast Conference, which didn’t warrant NCAA qualification.\n\nThe 2023 Blue Hens are now positioned to pursue a momentous accomplishment led by a hand-picked coach and keyed by, among others, an in-state pitcher who thought her college career was over a year ago.\n\nRare opportunity\n\nIn 21 previous CAA softball seasons, Delaware has reached the tournament final twice, both as the fourth seed, losing to Hofstra in 2004 and James Madison in 2021.\n\nCertainly, JMU’s move to Conference USA this year has opened the door for others. The Dukes won four of the last five CAA tournaments in which they competed, and became the Colonial’s first College World Series qualifier in 2021.\n\nCAA SOFTBALL: Tournament bracket, schedule\n\nDelaware goes into the 2023 tourney as the CAA’s No. 1 defensive team, No. 2 in pitching with a 2.67 ERA and No. 3 in batting with a .283 average.\n\nThe Blue Hens bounced back from losing two of three in their season-opening league series at Charleston and some mid-season difficulty that “led to some hard conversations,” fifth-year coach Jen Steele said.\n\nThe Hens are 17-3 since March 31 and, Steele said, “I give [the players] all the credit because they met the expectations and raised them.”\n\nSpring football:What we learned as Delaware wraps up spring football, eyes 2023 season\n\nGotta have the players, pitching\n\nDelaware had six players receive postseason CAA recognition, led by third-time All-CAA first teamer Hanna Garber. The leadoff hitter and third baseman from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has scored a school career record 161 runs and is 11 hits shy of that career mark. Garber has a .373 batting average and .544 slugging percentage with 19 of her 59 hits for extra bases.\n\nShe was joined on the first team by CAA Pitcher of the Year Emily Winburn, owner of a 2.16 ERA. First baseman Kiara Mills, a .309 hitter, was CAA Defensive Player of the Year and joined on the All-CAA second team by center-fielder Julz Garber, Hanna’s younger sister and a .371 hitter, and pitcher Taylor Wroten. Freshman Katie Scheivert was an All-Rookie pick while batting .317.\n\nFifth-year starters Hanna Garber and second baseman Brittney Mendoza were recruited by the previous coaching staff and happily inherited by Steele when she arrived.\n\nUnexpected bonus\n\nSussex Tech High graduate Wroten had played for a Florida-based travel team in high school. The Greenwood resident graduated from Indian River State College in Fort Pierce, Florida, last spring with a bachelor’s degree in biology.\n\nIn her two healthy softball seasons of 2020 and 2022, she had 1.17 and 1.71 ERAs.\n\n“I kind of accepted my softball journey was over,” she said.\n\nThen Steele called last June, knowing Wroten still had eligibility and the Blue Hens could use pitching help. Wroten hadn’t been recruited by Delaware in high school and had wanted to go to Florida anyway.\n\nDelaware baseball:Greenly gives Blue Hens baseball rare boost as top hitter, best pitcher\n\n“Life has so many plans that you don’t even know about so here I am,” she said.\n\nWroten had to adapt, as pitches called strikes in junior-college games are sometimes balls in the tighter NCAA Division I strike zone.\n\n“We didn’t really know what we would get out of her,” Steele said. “Sometimes junior college players struggle to adjust to this level . . . She’s surpassed expectations. She’s done a great job.”\n\nWroten has a 1.90 ERA and opponents have batted just .188 against her.\n\n“I think I’ve settled in pretty well and I’m really enjoying it,” she said. “It’s a nice way to go out.”\n\nThe right coach\n\nDelaware had never finished higher than third place (2003) in the CAA in 17 seasons and had just three winning records in league play when Steele was hired as UD coach in July of 2018. She had just completed her first season as head coach at Marshall in West Virginia after three at Jacksonville in Florida.\n\nIn researching possible candidates for the open position after John Seneca’s May dismissal, UD athletic director Chrissi Rawak had learned Steele might just be the ideal leader and contacted her.\n\n“I hadn’t even sent in my resume before I was already on campus,” said Steele.\n\nSteele found the UD position more appealing in terms of location, financial resources, university support and staffing. She made the jump.\n\nThe Hens went 19-4 in her second year, the 2020 season cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, and then finished third in the CAA in 2021.\n\nThe ‘elephant in the room’\n\nThe Blue Hens are quite aware they are chasing history. That brings additional pressure. They were a bit surprised last season when, flexing the No. 1 seed, opponents seemed charged up to face them.\n\nSteele’s response? “Everyone’s gonna play hard because it’s May, this is the championship.”\n\nDelaware (29-18 overall) lost five league games this year. Three teams just behind them – UNCW, Hofstra and Elon – dropped seven each so it all depends on who plays well this weekend.\n\nThe coach referred to ending Delaware's NCAA softball drought as the “elephant in the room” that had to be addressed. So her message to the Hens has been to stay in the moment.\n\n“One pitch at a time, one out at a time, don’t look too far ahead,” she said. “Since we’ve had that philosophy, we’ve been rolling . . . We’ll have to do that same thing this weekend.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

It was Delaware’s first winning league record since 2011, but a loss to rival Villanova, which went 5-6, in the season finale cost Delaware an FCS playoff berth.\n\n“We took a positive step forward. That was clear to see,” said senior linebacker Troy Reeder, one of five Blue Hens to receive preseason All-CAA notice. “I’m so thankful I have this year to make up for it but it just shows that we have more to go. We can’t leave anything up to chance. As big of a step as we took, we’ve got more in us and we need to bring more out of us.\n\n“This conference, anybody can beat anybody. If you look at it, every week is a playoff game because it only takes one weird loss to really hurt you and knock you out of the playoffs.”\n\nThree-time defending champion James Madison is the favorite, having picked up 21 of the 24 possible first-place votes, followed by New Hampshire, which received two first-place votes. Delaware doesn’t play JMU this year. The Hens visit UNH Oct. 20.\n\nRounding out the poll are Stony Brook and Elon, which received the other first-place vote, in the top five. They are followed by Villanova, Richmond, Maine, Albany, Towson, William & Mary and Rhode Island in the 12-team league.\n\nVoting was done by league coaches and media relations directors. The No. 3 spot is Delaware’s highest since being third in the 2011 preseason poll. The Hens hadn’t been higher than fifth since 2012.\n\n“The amount of respect [Delaware] was given is rightly so,” said Towson coach Rob Ambrose, whose team’s 18-17 win last year also thwarted the Hens. “They’ve got it all – players at every position, they have depth, they’re very very talented, they’re very fast, they’re very strong and they’ve got really good coaching. That’s a good combination.”\n\nThe seven-year postseason absence is four years longer than Delaware’s previous longest drought (1983-85) since the NCAA instituted playoffs for its lower divisions in 1973.\n\n“When our name didn’t get called [last year], that was heart-breaking,” said senior Joe Walker, Delaware’s former starting quarterback who is now a wide receiver. “We just don’t want to have that feeling again. We want to be able to be that Delaware team. Everybody knows the tradition – it’s all everybody talks about. We want to bring that back.”\n\nReceiving preseason All-CAA notice along with Reeder, the Penn State transfer out of Salesianum School, was senior running back Kani Kane, the Sussex Tech High graduate; senior tight end Charles Scarff; senior guard Mario Farinella; and senior safety Nasir Adderley. Farinella isn’t one of Delaware’s three returning starters on the offensive front but is coming off a productive spring and started earlier in his career.\n\nThe Blue Hens return eight starters on offense and seven on defense, with the defensive line, which lost Chicago Bears draftee Bilal Nichols and San Francisco 49ers signee Blaine Woodson, the only position area facing a major overhaul.\n\nReturning starting quarterback J.P. Caruso is expected to be challenged by Darius Wade, the Boston College transfer out of Middletown High, and junior Pet Kehoe in a situation Rocco termed “wide open.” All of Delaware’s top rushers and several of its leading receivers return.\n\nDelaware’s experience and the fact most players have now had a full year in his systems is the source of Rocco’s optimism.\n\n“We have to be a little more consistent from week to week and that is one of things that really challenges most programs,” he said. “It’s a very competitive league. I think on any given week anybody can come out victorious and I just didn’t think our consistency was where it needed to be, in particularly on the offensive side of the ball.

The UD field hockey team, an NCAA qualifier six of the last seven years and NCAA champion in 2016, sees its title dreams dashed before its first preseason practice.\n\nAs for moving those sports to next spring, Rawak said, \"We will be relentless in our efforts to identify a competitive season, ideally in the spring,\" adding that CAA schools will begin schedule discussions next week.\n\nBut other teams are also impacted, as spring sports such as rowing, tennis and golf have fall competition, too.\n\nWhat type of practice situations will be permitted isn't yet clear.\n\nIf fall athletes cannot play next spring their eligibility may be retained but that will be an NCAA decision, as was the case with 2020 spring athletes.\n\nNo decision has been made yet regarding basketball season and other winter sports, according to the CAA.\n\nNAME GAME: McKenzie, Fontana, Union teammates make statement on jerseys\n\nThe University of Delaware is near the geographic center of the 10-member CAA, which stretches from Northeastern in Boston to the College of Charleston (S.C.).\n\nIn between are Hofstra on Long Island, Drexel in Philadelphia, Towson outside Baltimore, Virginia members William & Mary and James Madison, and North Carolina’s Elon and UNC-Wilmington.\n\nIn football, however, the CAA is a 12-team assortment of schools whose actual full-time membership is in four different leagues – the CAA (Delaware, JMU, Elon, William & Mary and Towson); America East (Maine, New Hampshire, Stony Brook and Albany); Atlantic 10 (Richmond and Rhode Island); and Big East (Villanova).\n\nOn Friday, the A-10 and America East announced there would be no fall sports in their leagues.\n\nDelaware had faced a daunting yet welcomed challenge in its Sept. 5 football opener at defending CAA champion and NCAA runner-up James Madison.\n\nThat and 10 other football games have now been erased, including a Sept. 19 home opener against Long Island University at Delaware Stadium, where the new Whitney Athletic Center and other renovations are nearly complete, and a first-ever Sept. 26 trip to the ACC’s North Carolina State.\n\n\"I'm thankful that Coach Rocco and Chrissi and President [Dennis] Assanis made the right decisions to keep our health as the top priority,\" said Kedrick Whitehead, the UD safety out of Middletown High.\n\nThe CAA’s decision follows similar moves by NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) counterparts the Ivy League last week, the Patriot League Monday and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Wednesday.\n\nThose three leagues were united and shelved all fall sports, however. The MEAC includes Delaware State, which was scheduled to be Delaware’s final regular-season football foe Nov. 21 in Newark.\n\nThe state of the 2020 FCS playoffs remains in limbo, pending the decision of other leagues.\n\nAmong Delaware’s four-year schools, only Wesley College in Dover has not had its fall sports seasons stopped. Division III Wesley competes in the New Jersey Athletic Conference in football and the Atlantic East in other sports.\n\nThe Division II Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference, which includes Wilmington University and Goldey-Beacom College, nixed all competition until Jan. 1 due to coronavirus safety precautions on Monday.\n\nCollege sports have been quiet since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in mid-March, with schools closing, students being sent home and the NCAA basketball tournaments and spring sports cancelled.\n\nIn June, the CAA announced schools were not required to play league opponents in the regular season in field hockey, men’s and women’s soccer, volleyball, softball, baseball and men’s and women’s lacrosse. Later, the league announced all schools would qualify for postseason CAA championships, instead of just the top place-finishers.\n\nDelaware’s fall sports coaches had been busy putting together smaller, more regional, schedules. Now, they will not need those, at least not in the coming months.\n\nThere will certainly be an economic impact as well, as football crowds have long been among UD's primary sources of athletic income.\n\nDelaware football had $8.3 million in revenue but also $7.8 million in expenses in 2018-19, according to the U.S. Department of Education's Equity in Athletics data. The $8.3 million is roughly 20 percent of UD athletic revenue.\n\nAmong the additional expenses potentially incurred from moving fall sports to spring is extending the school year of those players who were expecting to graduate after the fall semester.\n\n\"We can't really control when we're gonna play but we can just work really hard and use it as an opportunity to get better,\" said Henderson, the Smyrna High grad.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

It is New Jersey's first offshore wind energy project and will be located about 13 nautical miles southeast of Atlantic City.\n\n\"Since Day One, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to jump-start the offshore wind industry across the country — and today’s approval for the Ocean Wind 1 project is another milestone in our efforts to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,\" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the announcement marked a \"pivotal inflection point\" in the state's transition toward carbon-free power.\n\nDeveloped by Denmark-based power company Ørsted, the Ocean Wind 1 project will generate enough electricity that could power up to 500,000 homes with nearly 100 wind turbines off the coast of southern New Jersey.\n\nThe project's approval marks a milestone for the American offshore wind sector, as the country lags behind offshore wind farm operations in Europe and Asia. It is the third commercial-scale offshore wind energy project in the United States to be approved by the Biden administration.\n\nOcean Wind 1 joins two other projects, the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts and the South Fork Wind project in New York, both of which are now under construction. Ørsted plans to have tall structures that will support wind turbines, called monopiles, installed in 2024 and to begin commercial operations in 2025.\n\nBut offshore wind has become a source of controversy in New Jersey, pitting politicians against one another down party lines and even dividing some environmental groups over its potential marine impacts.\n\nOcean Wind 1 construction to begin in the fall\n\nState and federal officials are moving ahead with approvals. Last week, the New Jersey Legislature voted to allow Ørsted to collect federal tax credits aimed at offshore wind farms. The bill is awaiting the governor's signature.\n\nMurphy said BOEM's approval brings New Jersey a step closer toward its green energy goals.\n\n\"As we continue to cultivate burgeoning new industries while confronting the worsening climate crisis, our state’s first offshore wind project will generate thousands of good-paying union jobs and considerable environmental benefits for generations to come,\" he said.\n\nOcean Wind 1's approval includes a provision for a commercial fisheries compensation program, according to BOEM. The fund will offer reimbursement for lost revenue, a safety fund for navigational equipment, and money for lost or damaged fishing gear.\n\nFederal officials said Ocean Wind 1 will also have to adhere to regulations designed to protect endangered and threatened marine animals, including enforcing vessel speed limits and funding various animal monitoring programs.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in the fall as Ørsted plans on “delivering on the promise of good-paying jobs, local investment and clean energy,” said David Hardy, the company’s CEO for the Americas.\n\nØrsted plans to begin laying electrical transmission cable and building onshore electrical substations. Monopiles are also being welded, sandblasted and painted at EEW American Offshore Structures’ facility at the Port of Paulsboro across the Delaware River from Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nOffshore wind farm battle:How dead whales became the symbol of a political battle in NJ and elsewhere\n\nProject proponents and critics divided over marine impacts\n\nProponents of offshore wind say climate change is a dangerous threat to New Jersey's marine and coastal ecosystems as well as millions of residents. Warming oceans will lead to worse storms and more frequent flooding; ocean acidification that will kill marine animals; and disruptions in migration routes and feeding and breeding areas.\n\nWarming ocean temperatures could also slow down critical circulation currents within the Atlantic Ocean and lead to changes in how heat moves between the equator and poles, potentially changing climates across portions of the Earth, according to NASA.\n\nBecause of these threats, proponents have said reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas through the transition to carbon-free energy is an essential part of slowing climate change and protecting critical ecosystems around the world.\n\nBut critics of offshore wind say the construction of wind farms will kill marine animals and disrupt the migrations of whales and other species. Offshore wind farms will also place thousands of acres of important fishing grounds off limits and destroy livelihoods in the fisheries business, according to critics.\n\nOpponents of the project are not giving up their efforts to stop Ocean Wind 1 from being constructed.\n\nEarlier this month, three New Jersey organizations — Save LBI, Defend Brigantine Beach and Protest Our Coast NJ — filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court to stop construction of the project.\n\nOcean Wind 1 will harm \"one of the most important marine communities on the East Coast and the core of New Jersey's $47 billion tourist industry,\" said Bruce Afran, an attorney for the three groups.\n\nUS offshore wind sector:The next few months will be big for offshore wind in America, and RI is playing a key role\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nAmanda Oglesby is an Ocean County native who covers Brick, Barnegat and Lacey townships as well as the environment.

A member of the Apollo 16 crew, former astronaut Charlie Duke, will be on hand in Huntsville on Wednesday as the space museum looks back on the April 1972 mission. The Apollo 16 capsule, nicknamed “Casper,” is housed at the museum, which cleaned up the spaceship earlier this year ahead of the celebration. Duke and NASA officials are among those who will participate in an event that also will focus on the space agency’s upcoming test of its new, 30-story Space Launch System rocket. NASA is targeting June for a test flight to send the rocket to the moon without a crew. The administrator of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Jody Singer, and James Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration development, will discuss the space agency’s work to return to the moon. After the first launch in NASA’s Artemis program, the agency plans to send astronauts around the moon in 2024. A lunar landing attempt is planned for as early as 2025. People last walked on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The final two F-35A Joint Strike Fighter jets have arrived at Eielson Air Force Base, completing the full complement of 54 aircraft. Col. David “Ajax” Berkland of the 354 Fighter Wing at Eielson called it “a really significant day for us in terms of the buildup of Eielson Air Force Base.” The base near Fairbanks was selected in 2016 to host F-35s, spawning a base expansion that cost more than a half-billion dollars and includes 36 new buildings and 54 housing units for the F-35s, Fairbanks television station KTVF reported Saturday, a day after the two final jets arrived. The Air Force says the fifth generation F-35 represents a “quantum leap” in air combat capability. Combined with two squadrons of F-22s at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, will have more operational fifth generation assets than anywhere else in the world, Eleventh Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. David A. Krumm, told Air Force Magazine. Krumm is the senior military official in Alaska. “Gen. Billy Mitchell talked about it in the 1930s that whoever holds Alaska holds the world. So the strategic importance of competing and securing our nation’s interests, which were there then, remains as much now as ever,” Berkland told KTVF. The expansion also includes personnel, with about 3,500 new active-duty airmen and their dependents stationed at the base.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A cannabis dispensary is offering tourists traveling through Sky Harbor International Airport a free shuttle directly to its doors starting Wednesday. The Mint dispensary in Guadalupe is calling the shuttle the #420 and offering it to people 21 and older. The Mint has long captured attention with its kitchen serving marijuana-infused pizza, burgers and other snacks and by offering free marijuana products to people who visited for a COVID-19 vaccination. The Arizona-based dispensary chain is kicking off the service Wednesday, a pseudo-holiday for cannabis consumers sometimes referred to simply as “4/20.” “National Cannabis Day gives us the opportunity to celebrate how much our industry has evolved and grown,” CEO Eivan Shahara said in a statement. “It’s also a great day to make history by delivering more innovation and excitement, while also finding ways to thank our patients, customers, visitors, and the community at large for their support.” The shuttle will pick up at all three Sky Harbor terminals during certain hours, and travelers can reserve a seat online at mintdeals.com/shuttle. Other marijuana-themed airport shuttles exist for a fee in places like Denver, but The Mint claims the free service is the first of its kind.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has reversed a judge’s decision to block a school district’s mask mandate that was implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Justices on Thursday reversed the temporary restraining order issued against the Bentonville School District’s mask requirement. Bentonville was among dozens of districts that imposed the requirement last year after a state law banning such mandates was blocked in a separate case. A group of parents had sued challenging the mandate. The court said that Arkansas’ laws give schools broad authority to determine their policies. “Based on this precedent, we conclude that the district properly authorized its policy,” Chief Justice Dan Kemp wrote in the court’s ruling. A spokeswoman said the district has no plans to reinstate the mask requirement at this time. In a separate opinion, Special Justice Howard Brill said parents have a right to be informed and to be heard on issues such as whether masks should be worn. But, Brill wrote, that doesn’t mean they have the right to “micromanage” schools. “If parents are dissatisfied with the school board decisions, they have a remedy,” wrote Brill, who was appointed to hear the case after Justice Rhonda Wood recused. “It is the ballot box.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A Northern California woman pleaded guilty Monday to faking her own kidnapping and lying to the FBI about it, leaving her motive unanswered in the carefully planned hoax that set off a massive three-week search before she resurfaced on Thanksgiving Day in 2016. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, offered no explanation for her elaborate hoax during the half-hour court hearing. “I feel very sad,” she said tearfully when Senior U.S. District Judge William Shubb asked her how she was feeling. “Were you kidnapped?” he asked her later in the hearing. “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “Did you lie to government agents when you told them you were kidnapped?” Shubb continued. “Yes, Your Honor,” she responded. Papini agreed to plead guilty in a deal with prosecutors reached last week and is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of the sentencing range, estimated to be between eight and 14 months in custody, down from the maximum 25 years for the two charges.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s high school athletics authority has ambitious plans to expand esports into half of Colorado high schools. Rashaan Davis, who oversees esports for the Colorado High School Activities Association, said this year’s season is the busiest yet. “There are over 100 teams playing multiple titles across our state,” Davis said. “We offer League of Legends, Rocket League, Madden and (Super Smash Bros. Ultimate).” Gamers have traditionally been labeled as socially awkward geeks. Harrison High coaches Tom McCartney and Sean Hart want to break that stigma. When they were in high school, they found comfort in video games, but schools didn’t tolerate gaming on school grounds, much less encourage it. As teachers, and now coaches, they want to foster a safe environment for those awkward geeks to develop and build their talents. “Those are the people who ended up being the entrepreneurs, the vanguards for new ideas and opportunities and waves,” said McCartney, an English and drama teacher. “Let’s build their confidence now, so they don’t have to wait until 33 or 34 when they find themselves and accept themselves to finally get started with building a new world.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWest Haven: Members of a state oversight board have decided they need greater control over the finances of the city, which has been under the microscope after a former state representative and others were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds awarded to the municipality. The Municipal Accountability Review Board voted Thursday to recommend that West Haven, which is currently under a level of state oversight known as Tier III, be upgraded to Tier IV. That means the state board would have additional management tools, including the ability to hire a financial manager for the city. It will ultimately be up to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont to decide whether to approve the stepped-up oversight, following a 30-day public comment period. City officials, including the mayor, opposed the move. They argued that West Haven, which has a long history of financial struggles, has made progress in recent years since working with the state board. Michael Last, the city’s treasurer, said he didn’t think the city of more than 55,000 people met the criteria for such a severe step. Board members countered that the alleged theft would not have occurred if proper financial safeguards recommended by the board were put in place.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: People living in the shadows of Croda’s New Castle-area manufacturing plant say it’s not a matter of if but when the plant has another dangerous leak along the Route 9 corridor. And it’s an even bigger concern now, as ethylene oxide, a highly flammable and explosive chemical that has been linked to various types of cancers, was found to be 30 times more cancerous for adults than previously thought, according to a report published by the Environmental Protection Agency’s independent Office of Inspector General. This chemical is the same one that leaked nearly 3,000 pounds into the air in 2018, shutting down the Delaware Memorial Bridge and scaring residents who were told to shelter in place as the flammable chemical leaked from the plant about a mile from their homes. “We’re living with a time bomb in our community – it already exploded one time,” said Jakim Mohammed, a local activist and Dunleith resident, as he stood within eyeshot of the plant. These concerns brought Croda, community members, and state and federal officials together Wednesday for a virtual meeting to discuss the company’s production of ethylene oxide and what that means for the health and safety of nearby residents. The meeting is one of the first sessions officials have held to update residents about the new risks associated with ethylene oxide since the federal watchdog urged the EPA to “promptly” hold public meetings in New Castle and 16 other locations across the country in March 2020.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Undaunted by soggy skies, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, kicked off the first White House Easter Egg Roll since before the coronavirus pandemic Monday, welcoming some 30,000 kids and adults for the all-day event. The president encouraged one young egg-roller, coaching the child: “Go. You got it.” “My job is to keep it from raining for another two minutes,” he said in opening remarks on the South Lawn. The theme for the day was “egg-ucation.” The first lady, a community college professor, turned the South Lawn into a school community with a variety of educational stations. Besides the egg roll and an egg hunt, the event included a schoolhouse activity area, a reading nook, a talent show, a place to teach about farming, a photo-taking station, a physical “egg-ucation” zone with an obstacle course, and a “cafetorium” where children learned to make treats. The COVID-19 pandemic led the White House to cancel the Easter Egg Roll in 2020 and 2021. But the event is back this year, as the outbreak of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths has eased. “This year we’re finally getting together again, and it’s so special,” the president told the guests. “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon, singer Ciara and actor-singer Kristin Chenoweth were set to add a dash of celebrity splash to the event, which dates to 1878.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Buena Vista: A baby zebra died at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom after running full speed into a gate when it was spooked by two ostriches Thursday, a television station reports. WESH reports it spoke with a family who witnessed the incident and was told it happened after the enormous birds were released into the same enclosure. The family said the experience was upsetting and sent the station cellphone video of Disney employees trying to save the animal. “We are heartbroken over the loss of our Hartmann’s mountain zebra that passed away yesterday, and we ask that you keep our dedicated animal care Cast Members in your thoughts,” a Disney spokesperson said in an email to the station.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: A pair of rare sea turtles have returned to the ocean after veterinarians spent nearly a year nursing them back to health on the Georgia coast. The adult female loggerhead turtles were released into the surf Friday on the beach at Jekyll Island. Both had been patients at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center, the island’s hospital for sick and injured sea turtles. One was admitted last May after getting struck by a boat, according to a Jekyll Island news release. The other arrived in July after being found anemic and covered in barnacles and leeches. A few hundred people, including children on school trips, turned out to bid the sea turtles farewell. It was the first time the Georgia Sea Turtle Center had held a turtle release publicly since 2019. The turtles returned to the wild just before the nesting season for loggerhead sea turtles begins in Georgia on May 1.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of training at the state Department of Public Safety pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing her of lying about her educational background. Public Training Officer J. Marte Martinez pleaded not guilty to perjury, tampering with a government record and unsworn falsification to authorities, according to her attorney Birney Bervar. Trial is set for June, Bervar said, declining to comment on the allegations. A complaint filed in court said Martinez made false statements about her educational background while testifying under oath before the Hawaii Labor Relations Board. The alleged false statements included having a liberal arts degree from a Virginia university. Martinez is also accused of submitting a transcript to the public safety department purported to be from an Oregon university, “which was falsely made, completed, or altered,” the complaint said. When applying for positions in the public safety department, she submitted an application that contained “statements about her educational background that she did not believe to be true,” the complaint said. The Department of Public Safety oversees Hawaii's jail and prisons, along with law enforcement divisions, including sheriffs.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The National Rifle Association on Monday endorsed Gov. Brad Little ahead of the Republican primary. NRA Idaho State Director Aiobheann Cline said in a statement that the endorsement reflects Little’s A-plus rating in the group and his support of Second Amendment issues during his first term. “Our members will interpret your ‘A+’ rating and endorsement as being a solid pro-gun/pro-hunting candidate who is a staunch defender of the Right to Keep and Bear Arm,” Cline said in the endorsement. Little has signed into law a number of gun-rights bills. Those include legislation protecting gun makers, sellers and weapons carriers during declared emergencies, along with another making it easier for nonresidents to carry firearms in the state. “With me, Idahoans have a governor who will always protect our Idaho way of life, and that includes my unwavering support for upholding our rights established in the Second Amendment,” Little said in a statement. His main challenger in the May 17 Republican primary is Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Almost four decades after a Black student graduated from Springfield High School at the top of her class, she’s finally been recognized as valedictorian. Tracey Meares, now a top legal scholar at Yale College of Law, was denied that honorific for 38 years until Saturday. Springfield School District 186 Superintendent Jennifer Gill presented Meares with the valedictorian medal and certificate after the screening of the documentary “No Title for Tracey” before a crowd of hundreds at the Hoogland Center for the Arts. Gill, who was a freshman at SHS when Meares was a senior, personally dug through old records, some on microfiche, to verify the ranking. “My first reaction is that it’s incredibly gratifying, but it’s also a lot to process,” Meares said after the presentation. Many, including Meares’ parents, believe systemic or institutional racism was behind the snub. The school typically had a valedictorian and a salutatorian, but as graduation neared in 1984, it opted for “top students” for Meares and a white student. It didn’t start naming valedictorians and salutatorians again until 1992. “It was not an individual act,” mother Carolyn Blackwell said. “That’s what makes it systemic.” The Southern Illinois University Institute for Plastic Surgery announced it had set up the “Tracey Meares Representation Matters” scholarship in her honor.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An upcoming Netflix documentary will take a closer look at a local fertility doctor who for years inseminated patients with his own sperm without their knowledge. Years ago, several Indiana residents found out their father – whom some had believed to be an anonymous sperm donor or the man who had raised them – was actually their mother’s doctor: Donald Cline, once well respected in his field in Indianapolis. Those biological children will soon tell the story in their own words in “Our Father,” coming to the streaming service May 11. Cline’s secret was discovered in 2014, when Jacoba Ballard took a DNA test, expecting to have one or two donor half-siblings, but discovered seven whose mothers had all gone to Cline. He’d told them they’d be inseminated with material from anonymous donor, whose sperm would not be used more than three times to conceive a child. Ballard told the Indiana Senate Judiciary Committee in 2019 that she’s discovered at least 46 half-siblings. A fertility fraud bill to prevent a similar situation was passed and signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb that year. Cline’s license was revoked by the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana in 2018, but he did not spend any time in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice after lying to officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: Armed with grant money, Humility Homes and Services plans to buy 60 housing units in its bid to end homelessness in the Quad Cities, nearly doubling the social service organization’s housing portfolio. In all, Humility Homes received more than $4.2 million from various agencies to help address an affordable housing shortage documented by several area organizations. “This is an important step in addressing the gap we have,” said Leslie Kilgannon, director of the Quad Cities Housing Council. “We have about 6,600 units we need in that extremely low-income category.” The bulk – 35 – of Humility Homes’ new housing units will be supportive housing, which combines services such as help with physical disabilities or health needs as well as mental illness or substance abuse treatment. The goal is to keep people who face challenges qualifying or keeping other housing in a stable place while they transition from an emergency shelter to more permanent housing. To provide the 35 supportive housing units, Scott County awarded Humility Homes $3.1 million from its allotment of federal COVID-19 relief funds from the American Rescue Plan Act. The other 25 units will provide more permanent affordable housing options for low-income families, some that rely on federal housing vouchers to pay rent.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A popular program for children to get free admission to some of the state’s coolest attractions is coming back this summer. Sunflower Summer – a Kansas State Department of Education initiative that gave over 70,000 residents free access to museums, parks and other attractions around the state in 2022 – is funded for the next few summers, Education Commissioner Randy Watson said. “We’re going to be doing it again, and we’re excited about it,” Watson told the Kansas State Department of Education. The department had used federal COVID-19 relief funding to start Sunflower Summer in 2021, in an effort to make sure all Kansas students had access to summer enrichment opportunities. This year, Gov. Laura Kelly decided to reallocate unused federal relief funds for private schools to the education department so it could continue to offer the program. To get free admission to Kansas attractions, parents or other adults download the Sunflower Summer app on their phone and register themselves and their children. The app then provides a single-use, free ticket for the child, as well as free tickets for up to two accompanying adults, to attend attractions around the state. In 2021, about 70 sites participated, including the Kansas Cosmosphere, Kansas Children’s Discovery Center and Eisenhower Presidential Library.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge on Monday blocked Republican-backed measures that would weaken Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s contracting authority and prevent him from challenging laws in court. The two new laws were temporarily blocked by Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas D. Wingate after the GOP-dominated Legislature passed them last week over Beshear’s vetoes. One of the laws being challenged would designate Kentucky’s attorney general as the only statewide constitutional officer allowed to spend taxpayer funds on litigation challenging a bill’s constitutionality. The other contested measure would shift decision-making authority over executive branch contracts to a legislative committee. Both laws took effect immediately. In his order, Wingate said the plaintiffs, including the governor, had “more than sufficiently demonstrated that their rights are being or will be violated.” “Of particular concern to the court is that plaintiffs have alleged that under HB248 their access to the courts has essentially been blocked,” the judge wrote. The governor claims that both measures violate Kentucky’s Constitution. The lawsuit continues the long-running legal fight between Beshear and Republican lawmakers over measures seeking to rein in his executive authority. Wingate will hear arguments in the latest case May 31.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state says its weekends-only red snapper season for anglers will start May 27 in state and federal waters, with a daily limit of three of the popular sport and food fish. The season will run Fridays through Sundays except for three holiday weekends – Memorial Day, which opens the season; the Fourth of July, and Labor Day. Those three weekends extend through Monday. Each licensed angler may take up to three red snapper a day, with a minimum length limit of 16 inches, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release. The catch limit has been two fish a day for years but was raised to four during a 2021 year-end reopening. The department said anglers went nearly 7,000 pounds over the private recreational allocation last year, so that amount was taken from this year’s total limit. The agency said this year’s season will remain open until recreational landings approach or reach 809,316 pounds. LDWF also reminded anglers that amberjack and gray triggerfish season will overlap the red snapper season on the opening Memorial Day weekend but be closed from June 1 through July 30. Resident and nonresident recreational anglers who fish for offshore species must have both Louisiana basic and saltwater recreational fishing licenses, plus the free recreational offshore landing permit.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined an appeal by the Penobscot Indian Nation in its fight with Maine over ownership and regulation of the tribe’s namesake river. It was a bitter defeat for the tribe that sued a decade ago, claiming the Penobscot River is part of its reservation. Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis said it was a disappointing outcome in a legal case that goes to the “core identity of the Penobscot Nation.” “We see this as a modern day territorial removal by the state by trying to separate us from our ancestral ties to our namesake river,” Francis told the Associated Press. A federal judge previously ruled that the reservation includes islands of the river’s main stem but not the waters. There were appeals to a panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of appeals and then to the full appeals court. On Monday, the nation’s top court, without comment, declined to hear the tribe’s appeals over river regulation. The ruling came as the Maine Legislature was considering several measures that relate to tribal sovereignty. The Penobscots, whose reservation is on an island in the river, sued in 2012 after then-Attorney General William Schneider issued an opinion that the tribe’s territory was limited to islands. The tribe said the lawsuit was necessary to protect tribal authority over its ancestral river and ensure sustenance rights.\n\nMaryland\n\nJessup: The first cohort of students in Georgetown University’s degree program for prisons in Maryland has begun classes, officials announced. In-person classes at the Patuxent Institution, in Jessup, started Feb. 14 for the 25 students accepted into the program. Officials announced the liberal arts degree program last spring as an expansion of the Prison Scholars Program that Georgetown offers at the D.C. jail. Students completing the program will earn bachelor’s degrees from the university. Officials said they expect 125 students to enroll within the next five years in the 120-credit interdisciplinary program. The university’s admissions process for the program began last fall with the help of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, officials said. After more than 300 applied from throughout the state prison system, those selected from other facilities were transferred to Patuxent Institution. Cultural humanities, interdisciplinary social science and global intellectual history are the program’s three available majors, officials said. Students this semester are taking introductory classes in writing and philosophy. The program will take about five years for most students to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: A wind-fueled blaze that damaged several homes Friday night displaced more than 70 people but resulted in no injuries, with one local leader calling it an “Easter miracle.” In all, 73 people belonging to 17 different families are residing in temporary housing following the blaze, Lawrence officials said Saturday. Fire officials said they believe the fire started on the third-floor balcony of a home in Lawrence before spreading to five other nearby residences. They said high winds helped the fire spread quickly in the densely settled neighborhood. All residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported. No pets were reported missing or injured either. “An Easter miracle,” said City Council President Marc Laplante. “It’s amazing that we were able to walk away from this.” Crews from fire departments in Massachusetts and New Hampshire worked for more than three hours to extinguish the fire. The Red Cross is providing housing and assistance to the occupants of the damaged homes, and local community groups are helping to coordinate donations.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Funeral services have been scheduled for Patrick Lyoya, an unarmed Black man fatally shot following a traffic stop and struggle with a white police officer. The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy Friday in Grand Rapids for Lyoya, according to Sharpton’s National Action Network and the office of attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Lyoya’s family. Services will begin at 11 a.m. at Renaissance Church of God in Christ in Grand Rapids. Lyoya, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was facedown on the ground April 4 when he was shot in the back of the head. Video footage released Wednesday by the police department showed the officer straddling Lyoya’s back at the time of the shooting. Video also showed the officer stopping Lyoya for driving with a license plate that didn’t belong to the vehicle, Lyoya’s attempt to run away before being tackled to the ground, and a struggle over the officer’s stun gun. The officer could be heard repeatedly ordering Lyoya to “let go” of his stun gun, at one point demanding: “Drop the Taser!” Michigan State Police are investigating the shooting and the events that led up to it. Police Chief Eric Winstrom, citing department policy, said he only would release the officer’s name if and when he is charged. Lyoya’s family and Crump have demanded that the city identify the officer.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Researchers plan to study a group of Minnesotans who dunk themselves in icy Lake Harriet every winter day. The Star Tribune reports researchers from Rockefeller University’s Cohen Laboratory of Molecular Metabolism are studying so-called brown fat that generates heat in cold conditions in humans. They’re currently investigating possible links between controlled exposure to cold such as ice water dips or cold showers and improved health. They’re also investigating blood biomarkers of brown fat in young New Yorkers using cooling vests. The researchers want to validate the study in a larger group of people, so starting this summer they’ll collect blood from a group of 70 people who dip themselves in Lake Harriet at least twice a week for a month in winter. The researchers hope to compare molecules in their blood during the summer and winter months as well as their responses to anxiety, stress and depression. The Minneapolis Park Board allows people to swim in lakes Harriet or Cedar during the winter if they apply for a permit and sign a waiver. Data from the waiver system indicates about 1,000 people have taken dips in the lakes since December 2021.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Archives and History is granting the public access to additional papers from the late author Eudora Welty, including letters written by members of her family. The release came Wednesday on the 113th anniversary of Welty’s birth. She died July 23, 2001. According to her will, the family correspondence was to remain private for 20 years after her death. Welty, who lived most of her life in Jackson, was known for the lyrical quality of her short stories and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her short novel “The Optimist’s Daughter,” published in 1972. While establishing herself as a writer, Welty photographed scenes of everyday life in Mississippi during the Great Depression for the Works Progress Administration. Welty’s niece, Mary Alice White, said in a news release from the archives department that the newly released letters begin with the courtship of Welty’s parents. White said they also include correspondence with relatives and papers and letters from others in the family. The Eudora Welty Collection was established in 1957, when she donated manuscripts, photographs and correspondence to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Hoping to end the tyranny of the Bradford pear tree, the state Department of Conservation is offering free replacements to residents who cut them down. The Bradford pear, also known as the Callery pear, can create unpleasant smells and, more importantly, is invasive and destructive to other plants and animals. While beautiful in bloom, it multiplies quickly and crowds out native plants, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. “The Callery pear became a popular ornamental landscape tree in the 1960s because it was inexpensive, it grew fast, and provided those eye-catching blooms in the spring,” said MDC Forestry Program Supervisor Russell Hinnah. “But that’s where its benefits end. Different varieties of the tree were planted close to each other, which resulted in cross-pollination, and they took over natural areas.” The Bradford pear also has a poor branch structure, so the trees don’t fare well in storms. MDC encourages homeowners and landscapers to grow native when picking a tree to plant. “There are many great trees to substitute,” Hinnah said. “Serviceberry trees produce similar showy white blooms in the spring and have small red fruits that attract wildlife.” Other great alternatives include American plum, hawthorn, eastern redbud and Missouri’s state tree, the flowering dogwood.\n\nMontana\n\nEnnis: Instead of only responding to 911 calls, some emergency responders in the state are working with patients in their homes to prevent unnecessary medical emergencies. Community paramedicine services can range from home check-ins between doctor visits to follow-up care with discharged hospital patients, Montana Public Radio reports. According to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services, 10 emergency medical service agencies across Montana are doing this work as part of a pilot program established by the 2019 Legislature. The state received federal funding to help set up a training program at Missoula College that could offer its first class later this year. DPHHS also plans to use a separate $5 million federal grant to expand community paramedicine services in Montana. Nicole Steeneken, who works in the state health department’s EMS and trauma section, said the new federal grant will train nearly 50 first responders in community paramedicine services. The grant will also pay for those emergency responders’ salaries for a year and half. “We’re trying to hit at least two providers within each county and then build upon that with larger organizations that might fill in the gaps,” Steeneken said. Nearly 30 EMS agencies in Montana have submitted applications to take part in the program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts signed a law Monday that will allow the state to move forward with plans to build a canal in Colorado to divert water out of the South Platte River because of fears about its neighbor’s increased water use. Ricketts proposed the canal project to help protect Nebraska’s water rights as the population of Colorado’s Front Range increases, although Colorado officials have questioned the need for it. “Water is our most important natural resource after our people. We need to continue to manage, protect and steward it here in our state,” Ricketts said. The law will allow Nebraska to begin work on the roughly $500 million canal, but the measure includes only $53.5 million to design the project and potentially secure purchase options on land that might be used for it in the future. Officials estimate it will take eight to 10 years to complete the project, and the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources will have to return to the Legislature next year to obtain additional funding. Ricketts, a Republican, has said the South Platte River Compact agreement that was approved by Nebraska, Colorado and Congress in 1923 gives Nebraska the right to build the canal. That would give Nebraska the right to claim some of the water in late fall, winter and early spring and store it for use in drier times.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials who run elections are worried supply shortages could bring delays as they order the paper and envelopes needed for upcoming primary and midterm elections. The dilemma is the result of global supply chain issues coupled with an increase in demand for paper brought on by the pandemic, leaving ballot vendors worried about not getting their supply in time for the elections, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Lawmakers in Nevada, which has almost 1.8 million active registered voters, passed a law last year directing election officials to send every registered voter a mail-in ballot unless they choose to opt out. Some counties, such as Nye, are also pushing for 100% paper ballot elections. Both processes will require election officials to increase their paper supply to print ballots. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office has known about the shortage for months and reached out to county officials to recommend they confirm with their ballot suppliers that they will get their supply in time. Joe Gloria, registrar of voters in the Las Vegas area, said he confirmed with the county’s vendors that the paper shortage would not affect Clark County in printing ballots or sample ballots for the 2022 election. The county, with more than 1.2 million active registered voters, has two different vendors, he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Three people have pleaded guilty to wire fraud in opening accounts at financial institutions in their names or in the names of churches to allow another person to use the accounts to sell virtual currency. They pleaded guilty in federal court last week and await sentencing in July. Additional counts of wire fraud and conspiracy were dropped as part of a plea agreement. Two admitted to opening accounts in the names of the Crypto Church of NH and the Church of the Invisible Hand. The accounts were not used by churches but by Ian Freeman to trade virtual currency, prosecutors said. The third person signed blank checks and gave Freeman the login information or those accounts, they said. “Each of the defendants was aware that banks would close these accounts if the banks knew the accounts were used to operate an unlicensed virtual currency business,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a news release Monday. Freeman and two others are scheduled for trial Nov. 1. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, money laundering, operating a continuing financial crimes enterprise, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Freeman is a leader of the libertarian Free Keene group and hosts a radio show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Legislation that proposes a later school start time statewide would not be ideal for all, say some educators who are advocating for the decision to be left up to local districts. Students who participate in after-school activities and sports or have part-time jobs would be at a disadvantage with the later start, some educators said, especially during the shorter days of winter. Some argue the change also won’t be ideal for those parents who have to drop off their children at school on their way to work. The bill introduced last month by Senate Education Committee Chair Vin Gopal and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin proposes requiring all New Jersey public high schools to start later in the morning to benefit students’ mental health. The bill proposes later start times, no later than 8:30 a.m, beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. Currently, most of the state’s high schools start between 7:30 a.m and 8:30 a.m. The choice should be left to individual districts and their school boards, said the New Jersey School Boards Association. Despite “well-documented research indicating that adolescents are not getting sufficient sleep for their health and well-being,” NJSBA spokesperson Janet Bamford said a potential law must deal with practical hurdles such as transportation costs and family schedules.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Organizers of a festival held on the date known for celebrating marijuana have had two permits denied by local police. The 420 Fest, scheduled for Wednesday in downtown Albuquerque, had submitted permit requests for streets to be blocked off. Melissa Thompson, New Mexico 420 Fest organizer, told KOB-TV she and her team have been communicating with the city about this since June. Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said the request was rejected because the department doesn’t have the manpower to block off streets in the middle of the workweek. Officers already have to shut down roads in the same area at night because of traffic around the bars. The 420 Fest has been an ongoing event for six years but was shelved during the pandemic. Thompson said thousands of people are expected to show up. While recreational cannabis is now permitted in New Mexico, attendees won’t be able to buy or consume any because they’ll be out in public. This month the state joined 17 others that have legalized recreation pot without significant legal challenges. The change came 15 years after the state first began offering medical marijuana.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A lawyer for recently resigned Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin said Monday that the Democrat has “very lively” legal issues from which to challenge corruption charges brought against him. Attorney Barry Berke told a Manhattan federal judge he expects to challenge on legal grounds the charges brought against Benjamin last week based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s skepticism toward criminal cases against politicians built solely on political contributions. In a statement issued after the hearing, Berke and defense attorney Dani James wrote: “This case is an unprecedented attempt to criminally charge an upstanding state leader for routine fundraising and support of a non-profit providing needed resources to Harlem public schools.” Benjamin’s arrest on charges alleging he promised to trade his political influence for a real estate developer’s campaign contributions created a political crisis for Gov. Kathy Hochul, seven months after she teamed up with Benjamin and pledged to restore order after ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat, resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Hochul had been lieutenant governor under Cuomo. Benjamin is free on $250,000 bail after he pleaded not guilty last Tuesday following his arrest on multiple charges including bribery, fraud, conspiracy and falsification of records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHarkers Island: A newborn wild horse will be raised as a domesticated animal after well-meaning tourists took it with them as they left a barrier island, officials at a national park said. The foal followed a group of visitors on Shackleford Banks for two hours March 26 with no other horses around, according to a Monday news release from the Cape Lookout National Seashore. When the visitors moved their boat to leave the island, the young horse tried to follow them. The park said the tourists were worried the newborn would drown, so they lifted it into their boat and left. The tourists were cited for removing the horse, and the park said it’s working with them to assist with future educational opportunities and community service projects that will benefit the banks and its horses. A stallion trying to protect its group of mares might drive them away from where a foal is sleeping, according to the national park. The stallion’s goal is to keep a mare from going back to get her offspring because he doesn’t want to lose her. The newborn might lose its harem in such cases. Dr. Sue Stuska, the park’s wildlife biologist, said in the news release that young horses will follow other horses or even people when separated from their mothers. But visitors shouldn’t come closer than 50 feet to wildlife.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: McKenzie County residents are lukewarm on federal efforts to rename a hamlet on the Montana border. A federal task force is working to replace the names of more than 660 geographic features nationwide that American Indians find derogatory. One of the features is Squaw Gap. The Bismarck Tribune reports the hamlet is little more than a community hall and an old schoolhouse. The community is named for a rock formation that was said to resemble an Indian woman carrying a child, according to the book “North Dakota Place Names” by Douglas A. Wick. McKenzie County Commission Vice Chair Kathy Skarda, who grew up in the Squaw Gap area, said her friends and family thought the renaming effort was a joke. She said she doesn’t think the name was ever meant to deride any ethnicity. People will have to live with the name change, she said, but the area will always be Squaw Gap to residents. Possible replacement names include Spring Creek, One-O-One Creek, Phillip Draw, West Fork Badlands Draw and Phillip Spring. The task force will forward recommendations to the Board on U.S. Geographic Names in the coming months. Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said he supports removing the term from place names. “It really causes serious and strong emotions and resistance to that term,” Fox said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall would be restricted under proposed legislation months in the works. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. Environmental groups largely oppose the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also question why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under Gov. Mike DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative. The state Senate approved the measure late last month along partisan lines. Some environmental groups softened their criticism after the Senate revised the bill to focus only on streams not already regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former Kay County corrections officer faces up to 10 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of excessive force and placing Black detainees in harm’s way by moving them into the same cell row as white supremacist inmates. Matthew Ware, 53, was found guilty of willfully depriving two pretrial detainees of their right to be free from a corrections officer’s deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm and of willfully depriving a third pretrial detainee of the right to be free from a corrections officer’s use of excessive force. Prosecutors said while Ware was serving as lieutenant at the Kay County Detention Center in Newkirk on May 18, 2017, he ordered lower-ranking corrections officers to move D’Angelo Wilson and Marcus Miller to a cell row housing white supremacist inmates who Ware knew posed a danger to Wilson and Miller. Ware later ordered the officers to unlock the jail cells of Wilson and Miller and the white supremacist inmates at the same time the following morning, prosecutors said. When the cells were unlocked, the white supremacist inmates attacked Wilson and Miller, causing injuries to both, including a facial laceration to Wilson that required seven stitches, prosecutors said.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: Planned Parenthood is renting medical office space in a town on the Oregon-Idaho border. Planned Parenthood has not confirmed its plans for the space but has said it’s preparing for an influx of out-of-state patients seeking abortions in Oregon because of multiple legal challenges to abortion rights, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Earlier this year the group successfully lobbied the Oregon Legislature to set aside $15 million in an unrestricted fund for reproductive health equity. “No matter what happens, we will be there for our in-state and out-of-state neighbors and continue to meet the needs of our patients,” said Kenji Nozaki, the chief of affiliate operations at Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette. “We are prepared to support anyone who seeks their legal right to decide whether and when to become pregnant.” The office space Planned Parenthood is renting in Ontario was previously home to the Four Rivers Health Clinic, a nonprofit serving people without health insurance. Joe Recla, the group’s executive director, said Four Rivers will use the rental income to continue to support uninsured patients. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Ontario could be a significant high desert outpost for access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. The town is about an hour’s drive from Boise, Idaho.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s acting health secretary is leaving the job, and Gov. Tom Wolf said Monday that his physician general will take over leadership of the department. Wolf said Keara Klinepeter’s last day is Friday. He plans to name Dr. Denise Johnson to succeed her as acting health secretary. Klinepeter has been acting secretary since her predecessor, Alison Beam, left at the end of 2021. Klinepeter has been deeply involved in the government’s handling of COVID-19, including as special adviser to the secretary and executive deputy secretary. Johnson said she was honored to lead the Health Department during what she called a transformative time in public health. Wolf spokeswoman Beth Rementer said Johnson will also continue to serve as physician general.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 70 employees at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort are accusing the company of violating federal and state fair labor laws by failing to pay them adequate overtime wages and systematically undercutting their weekly paychecks. Three employees sued Bally’s Twin River last month in U.S. District Court, alleging the casino was willfully and repeatedly miscalculating its pay for hourly, tipped workers. Dozens more employees who worked at Twin River in the past three years are seeking to join the class-action lawsuit. Those affected include dealers and servers and other tip-based employees. “We think there’s substantial money involved,” Chip Muller, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said Friday. The state-operated casino is privately owned. Patti Doyle, a spokeswoman for Twin River, said the company declined to comment because the matter involves personnel and pending litigation. According to the suit, the employees worked more than 40 hours some weeks but were paid 1.5 times an hourly rate that fell below the required state minimum wage. Federal fair labor and state laws require the employer to pay an hourly rate of 1.5 times the regular rate, which cannot be lower than the state minimum wage, for any overtime hours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHampton: Authorities are investigating a shooting at a nightclub early Sunday that wounded at least nine people. It was the second mass shooting in the state and the third in the nation during the Easter holiday weekend. No one was reported killed in the violence at Cara’s Lounge in Hampton County, roughly 80 miles west of Charleston, according to an email from South Carolina’s State Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting. A phone call to the nightclub was not answered. Gunfire had erupted Saturday at a busy mall in the state capital, Columbia, about 90 miles north of Sunday’s nightclub shooting. Nine people were shot, and five people sustained other kinds of injuries while trying to flee the scene at the Columbiana Centre, Columbia Police Chief W.H. “Skip” Holbrook said Saturday. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 73. None faced life-threatening injuries. “We don’t believe this was random,” Holbrook said. “We believe they knew each other, and something led to the gunfire.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The chief federal prosecutor in the state announced Monday that he’s retiring. U.S. Attorney Dennis Holmes spent more than 43 years as a prosecutor in South Dakota. The Custer native began his career as a prosecutor in 1978 as an intern in the Pennington County States Attorney’s Office while he was still in law school at the University of South Dakota. He went on to serve as an assistant state attorney general, rising to become chief deputy attorney general. He joined the U.S. attorney’s office in Pierre in 1988 and moved to the Sioux Falls office in 1995, where he prosecuted a wide array of cases ranging from large-scale drug conspiracies to environmental crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed him as U.S. attorney for 120 days in December following U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons’ resignation.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Demolition of the largest house in the state began Monday. The teardown of the 40,000-square-foot, 86-room Villa Collina is expected to take several days. Total Demolition Services is leading the work. The extravagant structure was purchased by LView Properties LLC for $6.5 million last October, according to Knox County property records. The property will be split into three lots for University of Tennessee board of trustees Chair John Compton, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and David and Annie Colquitt. Mike and Deane Conley were the first owners of the Italianate-style mansion and built the house in stages between 1993 and 2000. It is the largest house in Tennessee and the 84th largest in the country, according to the Villa Collina website. The mansion has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a commercial-grade kitchen and a three-story library, among other audacious amenities. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping room is the $5 million master suite, featuring Swarovski crystal chandeliers and $200,000 doorknobs. In December, an auction that gained the interest of people from around the country was held to sell items in the home before demolition. From stained-glass panels to decorative bathroom fixtures, the auction was full of unique, luxury items.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the conviction of death row inmate Kristopher Love, who claimed his trial was improperly influenced by racial bias after a juror said he believed nonwhite races were more violent. No reason was given for rejecting Love’s appeal, but the court’s three liberal justices issued a dissenting opinion saying the inmate’s claim deserved closer scrutiny. “Racial bias is odious in all aspects, but especially pernicious in the administration of justice,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The legal challenge by Love, a Black man, focused on the jury selection portion of his 2018 trial in Dallas, where a potential juror said he believed nonwhite races were “more violent races,” citing statistics seen in news reports and in criminology classes he had taken. Defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully to strike the man from Love’s jury. Sotomayor criticized the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which upheld Love’s death sentence in a unanimous ruling, finding last year that any error made at Love’s trial was harmless because the judge had given defense lawyers two extra peremptory strikes that let them reject potential jurors for any reason. Those two extra challenges, however, had already been used.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought-stricken state continues to see below-normal levels of snowpack, and Utah water officials said Friday that they don’t expect the annual spring runoff to provide nearly enough water to refill the state’s reservoirs. Some late-season snow provides some help, but 99% of the state remains in severe drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources. Some 95% of the water supplies used by state residents comes from snowmelt that flows into state reservoirs. “Utah has been in drought eight of the last 10 years, and this year’s disappointing snowpack is not going to pull the state out of drought,” said Brian Steed, executive director of the state Department of Natural Resources. “The recent snowstorms were beneficial, however, they added less than an inch of water to our snowpack.” Of the 95 measured streams, 51 are flowing below normal despite spring runoff. Eight streams are flowing at record-low conditions. The statewide snow water equivalent, or how much water would be in the snowpack if it melted, peaked at 12 inches this year, which was 75% of the typical median peak of 16 inches. Twenty-eight of Utah’s largest 45 reservoirs are below 55% of available capacity. Overall statewide storage is 58% of capacity. At this time last year, reservoirs were about 67% of capacity.\n\nVermont\n\nPawlet: The owner of an unpermitted firing range is facing jail time if he won’t allow town officials to visit the property within 30 days, a judge said Monday. The town has been working for years to get Daniel Banyai to comply with its zoning regulations and later orders from the state Environmental Court. During the remote hearing, Environmental Court Judge Thomas Durkin also told Banyai that he must sign a contract within 10 days with a surveyor to complete an assessment of the 30-acre property in West Pawlet to determine what is located there. “I will caution Mr. Banyai that if you do not abide by this interim order in any respect I will then immediately … consider any request made by the town of Pawlet to have you jailed until you comply,” Durkin said. During the three-hour hearing, Banyai’s lawyer Robert Kaplan said he only began representing Banyai last month, but he would work with town officials and his client to find an acceptable date for a site visit. Banyai bought the 30-acre property known as Slate Ridge in 2013 and sometime in 2017 began operating what he calls a firearms training facility. The property is only permitted to have a garage with an apartment. Slate Ridge neighbors have complained for some time about gunfire at the facility and what they claimed were threats and intimidation by Banyai and his supporters. Many of the neighbors of Slate Ridge are afraid to talk publicly because of fears for their safety.\n\nVirginia\n\nBedford: Local officials are citing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers among reasons for selling a county-owned nursing home in southwestern Virginia. The Bedford County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a special meeting to consider selling the nursing home. The nursing home was established as the County Poor Farm in 1831. The News & Advance reports that county officials are considering selling the facility to Roanoke-based American HealthCare LLC. County officials released a statement saying that with an increasing regulatory environment surrounding nursing homes, industry experts who specialize in health care compliance, rather than local government officials with no such expertise, are in a better position to make decisions. The statement also noted that the COVID-19 pandemic further prompted local officials to explore their options, and that the vaccine mandate for health care employees is “contrary to the positions of all board members” and has complicated uniformity in how county employees are treated.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: After years of protest, moratoriums and delays, King County has granted approval for a proposed asphalt plant to be built on the banks of the Cedar River. The county’s Department of Local Services ruled Thursday that the project, which has been fiercely opposed by neighbors and environmental groups, “does not pose a probable significant adverse impact to the environment,” as long as the company takes mitigation measures. The decision comes six years after Lakeside Industries bought the 25-acre parcel on Highway 169 and nearly four years after Lakeside, which has a dozen asphalt plants in Western Washington, first applied to build the plant, the Seattle Times reports. The county also said an environmental impact statement – which had been requested by the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and others – was not necessary. The site sits about 50 yards from the Cedar River, separated by a five-lane highway and bike path. A traffic study found the plant will require 460 truck trips each weekday. The site was rezoned in 2008, in a little-noticed amendment to a massive piece of mandatory legislation. It was shifted from rural, with only one home allowed every 5 acres, to industrial. Lakeside bought the site in 2016 for $9.5 million, five times its assessed value.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State residents have until close of business Tuesday to register to vote or update their registration for the May 10 primary. It is especially important for voters who have moved to a different address, changed their name or want to change political party to update registration, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said in a news release. Registration can be completed online at GoVoteWV.com by close of business Tuesday; by mailing a paper application to the county clerk, postmarked by Tuesday; or in person at the offices of the county clerk, secretary of state, Division of Motor Vehicles, pubic assistance, agencies serving people with disabilities and military recruiting agencies, the release said. More information on the primary election is also available at GoVoteWV.com.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway wants to spend $425,000 to design a system to filter PFAS chemicals out of a city well. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the mayor said the system would be the first in the state designed to filter the so-called forever chemicals out of drinking water. Rhodes-Conway and Alderwoman Nasra Wehelie said they’ve drafted a resolution authorizing city water officials to contract with AECOM for up to $375,000 in design and engineering services for the system. The resolution includes another $50,000 for staff time. City officials say a no-bid contract is necessary in order to submit the project for state grants in October. The money is part of $143 million the state is receiving through the infrastructure aid bill Congress passed last year. The bill provides $12.8 million in each of the next five years for projects targeting emerging contaminants in drinking water. Competition for the grants is expected to be stiff. The city’s water quality manager, Joe Grande, said the filtration likely would cost about $670,000 to install and between $136,000 and $300,000 annually to operate depending on the level of PFAS contamination allowed. The city closed Well 15 in 2009 after tests showed elevated levels of PFAS, likely stemming from the Dane County Regional Airport.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In honor of National Donate Life Month, Donor Alliance is inviting residents to celebrate the gift of life by raising awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation at events across the state. Ranging from the upcoming Wyoming Donor Dash event – a 5K walk/run April 23 at the Tate Pumphouse in Casper – to celebrations at Driver Services and hospitals across Wyoming, there are plenty of opportunities for Wyoming residents to honor the lives of donors, celebrate the lives of recipients and raise awareness for those still waiting for a lifesaving transplant. “Wyoming continues to make an incredible impact when it comes to residents who have signed up as organ and tissue donors,” said Jennifer Prinz, president and CEO of Donor Alliance. “As we honor National Donate Life Month in Wyoming, we’re aiming to grow awareness and support of the generous gift of organ and tissue donation.” In honor of Blue and Green Day on Friday, twenty-one of the state’s Driver Services offices in addition to hospitals across Wyoming are honoring the day with celebrations and office decorations. Residents are encouraged to join the celebration by dressing in blue and green to raise awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/19/animal-rescue-flesh-eating-bacteria-child-marriage-news-around-states/50853381/", "title": "Animal rescue, flesh-eating bacteria: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A judicial panel convicted a judge of violating ethics rules by failing to return to work and serve without pay following her conviction in an earlier ethics case, court documents show. Jefferson County Circuit Judge Tracie Todd was given a 120-day suspension without pay in an order filed Monday following a trial that lasted five days over three months before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary. Todd was convicted last year of violating orders of an appellate court and, as punishment, ordered to work for 90 days without pay beginning last Dec. 6, news outlets reported. Rather than reporting for duty at the courthouse in Birmingham, Todd remained for most of the period in Chicago, where her husband and children live, evidence showed. Todd, who testified in her own defense, claimed she worked remotely while in Chicago and couldn’t return to Alabama because of illness and COVID-19 quarantines that restricted her from travel. The court could have permanently removed Todd, and one of her lawyers, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said the decision to only suspend her for four months represented a vindication. “Judges, lawyers, and court personnel consistently testified that Judge Todd displays the greatest of integrity, honesty, and compassion,” Ungvarsky said. The Court of the Judiciary convicted Todd in December 2021 of violating judicial ethics by disregarding decisions by higher courts and inserting her own opinions into rulings, including one that declared Alabama’s death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the decision.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly leadership is condemning remarks made by a member of the public during last week’s Assembly meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. When testifying on an ordinance about designating a former hotel as a temporary emergency shelter, a man made racist and derogatory comments about Alaska Native people, according to the news outlet. East Anchorage Assembly member Forrest Dunbar swiftly rebuked the comments. In a statement Tuesday, Assembly chair Suzanne LaFrance and vice-chair Chris Constant said they wanted to “speak out against the racist and offensive statements made by the member of the public. Unfortunately, this is not the first time racist views have been expressed in the Assembly Chambers.”\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A man convicted last month in the first of two murder cases is seeking a new trial, according to authorities. Christopher Clements was convicted Sept. 30 of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of 13-year-old Maribel Gonzalez. He was scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday in Pima County Superior Court, but the date has been moved to Nov. 14. Court officials also said Clements’ attorneys have filed a motion for a new trial and a motion for judgment of acquittal not withstanding the verdict. A Nov. 7 hearing is set for both motions. A judge also will hear testimony Nov. 14 for a possible change of venue for Clements’ other murder trial, scheduled for Feb. 2 involving the death of 6-year-old Isabel Celis. Clements, a 40-year-old convicted sex offender with a long criminal record, is facing life in prison when he’s sentenced in the Gonzalez case. Clements was arrested in 2018 and indicted on 22 felony counts including two counts each of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the girls’ deaths.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that is often mixed with illegal drugs such as methamphetamine or heroin, is continuing to cause more overdoses and deaths in Fort Smith and the state. Fort Smith emergency responders have saved the lives of 66 people who overdosed on fentanyl this year with the life-saving Narcan drug that can counter the deadly effects of fentanyl and opiates. Fort Smith police report that paramedics, firefighters and others have given 194 doses of Narcan that could have resulted in deadly overdoses. Of those lives that have have been saved, 66 people were confirmed to have fentanyl in their system with an additional 31 people overdosing on unconfirmed substances and pills possibly with fentanyl.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A motorcyclist and Navy veteran who lost a leg in a 2019 chain-reaction crash started by a Navy sailor driving a military van near San Diego has won a $10.8 million settlement against the United States. Attorneys for the motorcyclist, Peter Arthur, said the settlement is one of the largest against the federal government in the San Diego area for a suit involving a vehicle collision, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. Arthur, a 49-year-old who served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, underwent multiple surgeries following the Sept. 13, 2019, crash. Arthur was thrown from his motorcycle, causing the femur, tibia and fibula in his right leg to shatter, according to his civil lawsuit. Doctors eventually had to amputate the leg above the knee. Navy sailor Michael Stanley Reynolds was driving a large passenger van on Interstate 5 when he “suddenly and without warning” swerved into the next lane to his left, causing several vehicles to crash, according to the lawsuit. Reynolds did not face criminal charges in connection with the crash. A Navy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by the Union-Tribune. Arthur’s civil lawsuit against the federal government alleges his injuries were “permanent, disfiguring, and disabling” and “will require extensive future medical care, life care, and vocational rehabilitation.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences recently announced a $278million upgrade and expansion of its current vet school facilities on the university’s south campus. The new veterinary health complex, which is scheduled to break ground in early 2023 and be completed in 2028, will include an expansion of more than 300,000 square feet. The complex will have a veterinary education center and primary care clinic, and there will be renovations or expansions of current facilities, including a livestock teaching hospital and an animal specialty hospital. The school’s current teaching hospital off of Drake Road and College Avenue will be remodeled to become the animal specialty hospital. All work will be done in phases, so some elements will be completed prior to 2028. “Our college ranks among the world’s top institutions in veterinary and biomedical education and research,” said Sue VandeWoude, dean of the college, in the university’s release. “Our expansion plan for the south campus … will help us continue our tradition of excellence in the academic mission of teaching; the assessment of novel methods for training clinical students; and our research and service to the community.” With the new buildings come curricula changes, too. The new facilities will give CSU what it needs to implement a new curriculum focused on educating “day one-ready” veterinarians using medical training along with training in “problem-solving, conflict resolution, decision-making and mental, physical and financial wellbeing,” according to a release from the university.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Less than a week after two police officers were killed in an ambush, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes called for a national ban on assault weapons, while her Republican challenger, George Logan, stressed that more needs to be done to support law enforcement. The two are locked in a closely watched race for the state’s 5th Congressional District that has attracted more than $5 million in outside money. Appearing in their first televised debate, the pair was asked about a shooting that left two officers dead in Bristol, about 20 minutes away from where the debate was held. Hayes said officers like her husband, a 25-year-veteran of the Waterbury Police Department, can be outgunned. Noting that the state already has an assault weapons ban, Logan criticized Hayes for voting in favor of what he called an “anti-police bill.” He was referring to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which banned chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability. The bill was later blocked in the Senate.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: A state trooper indicted last year for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and official misconduct in New Castle County Superior Court on Monday, the Delaware Department of Justice said. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9 before his suspension in May 2021, was sentenced to a year of probation and 33 hours of community service – one hour for every false e-warning he filed. He also had to surrender his Council on Police Training certifications. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings called Ramirez’s traffic warning scheme an “abuse of power” and said it “victimized innocent motorists,” some of whom did not even know they had received an e-warning. Others weren’t even driving when the fraudulent traffic stop supposedly occurred. Ramirez was officially sentenced to two concurrent yearlong prison sentences. It was suspended for a year of probation. Delaware State Police Superintendent Colonel Melissa Zebley noted in a written statement that Ramirez is no longer employed by the statewide police department.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro Transit Police investigators are looking into an incident captured on video in which a woman was attacked and thrown off a bus, WUSA-TV reports. The woman said she was on the bus, which was headed to Deanwood on Monday afternoon, with her two children when a group of kids got on the bus and started cursing and acting rowdy, according to the news outlet. Things escalated and eventually turned physical when the woman asked the kids to stop cursing, according to the person who filmed the footage. At least three people can be seen grabbing the woman and pushing her out the door when the bus came to a stop, the news outlet reports.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The state has seen an increase in cases of flesh-eating bacteria this year driven largely by a surge in the county hit hardest by Hurricane Ian. The state Department of Health reports that as of Friday there have been 65 cases of vibrio vulnificus infections and 11 deaths in Florida this year. That compares with 34 cases and 10 deaths reported during all of 2021. In Lee County, where Ian stormed ashore last month, the health department reports 29 cases this year and four deaths. Health officials didn’t give a breakdown of how many of the cases were before or after Ian struck. Lee County health officials earlier this month warned people that the post-hurricane environment – including warm, standing water – could pose a danger from the potentially deadly bacteria. “Flood waters and standing waters following a hurricane pose many risks, including infectious diseases such as vibrio vulnificus,” the county health department said in a news release Oct. 3 that urged the public to take precautions. The advisory said that people with open wounds, cuts, or scratches can be exposed to the bacteria through contact with sea water or brackish water. People with open wounds should avoid such water and seek medical care immediately if an infection is apparent.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two former jail detainees testified that deputies of a sheriff charged with violating their civil rights kept them in restraint chairs for hours, causing them to urinate on themselves while they were bound. Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill is standing trial on federal charges that he violated the rights of seven detainees. Prosecutors say their placement in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment and caused pain and bodily injury. Hill is widely known as one of metro Atlanta’s most flamboyant lawmen. He calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery to promote himself on social media and in campaign ads. This is his second trial on criminal charges. Clayton County voters reelected Hill in 2012 while he was under indictment the first time, accused of using his office for personal gain. He beat those charges. Hill has pleaded not guilty to the civil rights charges, which his attorneys say are politically motivated. Drew Findling, one of Hill’s lawyers, cross-examined both men Tuesday about what he said where inconsistencies between their trial testimony and what they had previously told investigators.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: The Navy said Tuesday it was still fixing an underground water pipe that ruptured last week and interrupted the supply of water to about 93,000 people at Pearl Harbor. The bursting of the 36-inch water main has also forced the Navy to postpone plans to remove 1 gallon of fuel from three pipelines at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, the tank farm that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year. Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, the commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, said crews were on schedule to finish fixing the broken water main in about one week. When the water main burst last Friday, officials had to divert water to the west side of the base. That increased pressure in smaller water lines there, leading to additional pipe breaks in Pearl City Peninsula and West Loch. These two smaller breaks have since been repaired. The Navy issued a boil water advisory for affected areas last Friday, and gyms and child care centers have been closed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A legal loophole in the state that allows parents of teens to nullify child custody agreements by arranging child marriages will remain in effect, under a ruling from the state Supreme Court on Tuesday. In a split decision, the high court declined to decide whether Idaho’s child marriage law – which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to marry if one parent agrees to the union – is unconstitutional. Instead, the justices said that once a child is emancipated by marriage, the family court loses jurisdiction over custody matters. The case arose from a custody battle between a Boise woman and her ex-husband, who planned to move to Florida and wanted to take their 16-year-old daughter along. The ex-husband was accused of setting up a “sham marriage” between his daughter and another teen as a way to end the custody fight.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker and Republican challenger Darren Bailey traded barbs at the final gubernatorial debate Tuesday. The debate held at the WGN-TV studios featured many of the same topics as the prior debate at Illinois State University including crime, abortion and the SAFE-T Act. However, new wrinkles were added in the hourlong back and forth such as school curriculum and the possibility of a new stadium for the Chicago Bears. While questions primarily focused on the issues, both candidates landed punches with Pritzker calling Bailey a “threat to democracy” and Bailey labeling Chicago “Pritzkerville” because of crime in the city. It was the last scheduled televised debate between the candidates and possibly the last time they shared venues, giving Bailey perhaps his last chance to cut into Pritzker’s lead in the polls. Recent polling conducted by The Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ found the Democrat with 49% of voters supporting him compared to 34% for Bailey.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man has been convicted of reckless homicide in the fatal 2020 shooting of a young Black man during unrest sparked by outrage over George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Prosecutors had charged Tyler Newby, 32, with murder, but after a one-day bench trial a Marion County judge found Newby, who is white, guilty Monday of the lesser crime of reckless homicide in Dorian Murrell’s death. His sentencing was set for Nov. 10. Murrell, 18, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart after being shot in downtown Indianapolis on May 31, 2020, during violence that followed protests over the death of Floyd, a Black man. Newby’s first trial in Murrell’s killing ended in a mistrial last year after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict following several hours of deliberation. Newby turned himself in shortly after the shooting. He claimed self defense, saying the shooting took place after he was approached by a group of people and shoved to the ground. Newby said he saw someone standing over him and fired. Prosecutors argued that being shoved to the ground wasn’t justification to take someone’s life. Three people who had been with Murrell when he was shot have been charged in connection with the robbery and killing of Chris Beaty, a businessman and a former Indiana University football player. Beaty, 38, was fatally shot in downtown Indianapolis hours before Murrell was slain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds now has the support of a majority of likely Iowa voters – and a sizable lead over her competitors with just over three weeks until Election Day. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds Reynolds at 52% support, holding a 17-percentage point advantage over Democrat Deidre DeJear, who has 35%. Libertarian Rick Stewart trails at 4%. Another 4% of likely voters say they are not sure for whom they would vote, 3% say they would vote for “someone else,” and 1% say they would not vote. Reynolds is holding her large lead even as more Iowans solidify their support behind one of the two major-party candidates. Reynolds also enjoyed a 17-point margin in the previous Iowa Poll in July, even though her overall support was lower in that poll, at 48%, versus 31% for DeJear. Fewer Iowans now say they’re undecided or would vote for “someone else,” but support for both Reynolds and DeJear increased equally – by 4 percentage points – since the July poll. And Reynolds maintains a significant advantage over DeJear in name recognition: Among all Iowans, more than half, 51%, still don’t know enough about DeJear to form an opinion about her, versus only 3% for Reynolds, the poll found. Reynolds also enjoys her highest approval rating since fall of 2021, at 53%.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas has begun the process of returning Native American remains and other sacred objects that were recently discovered in its museum collections, the university said. University officials said in a statement posted online that “culturally unidentified individual remains,” funeral objects and other sacred objects were found in Spooner Hall and Lippincott Hall Annex on the Lawrence campus. The university is verifying its inventory of Indigenous artifacts it holds across campus. A spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to questions about the number of artifacts, specifically how and when they were found, or to which tribes they belong. The announcement comes 32 years after the passage of the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which sets out criteria for tribal nations to reclaim human remains and other objects related to burials. Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod initially announced the discovery in a message to the campus Sept. 20. The university had begun efforts to repatriate some items in the past, but the process was not completed, he said. The university said its repatriation efforts will include forming an advisory committee, consulting with tribal nations, auditing all university collections, securing space for the Indigenous Studies Program, supporting gathering opportunities for the university’s Native American community, and instituting repatriation policies and procedures. “The intent in sharing this announcement is to publicly apologize to Native communities and peoples, past, present, and future, and to apologize to the tribal nations across North America,” the university’s statement said.\n\nKentucky\n\nBurkesville: The state’s 26th Trail Town has been certified, and it is in Cumberland County, the Department of Parks said. “Trail Towns are ideal destinations for outdoor recreation lovers,” Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a news release Tuesday. “The program helps drive local and state economies and is an ever-increasing component of the nation’s economic impact. It also brings about more healthy activities and vibrant communities and parks.” The program is designed to provide a strategic plan that communities can use to capitalize on travel opportunities, the agency said. It also works to create healthy physical activities with access to trails and recreational areas. The Burkesville Trail Town offerings feature the Cumberland River and the connection to the downtown area. The river offers boating, fishing, and paddling. Burkesville is also home to Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outage involving a Coast Guard marine warning system and “data gaps” in radar systems were factors in last year’s deadly capsize of an oil industry vessel during severe storms off of Louisiana’s coast, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report issued Tuesday. Thirteen of the 19 people aboard the Seacor Power died after the offshore vessel capsized in the Gulf after leaving Port Fourchon. Known as a lift boat, the vessel had three legs that could be lowered to the sea floor, converting the ship to an offshore platform for servicing oil and gas facilities. It had been chartered by Talos Energy LLC for work on a Gulf platform when it was hit by high winds in rough seas and capsized on April 13, 2021. An NTSB preliminary report had said the Seacor Power had begun to lower its stabilizing legs and was trying to turn to face heavy winds when it flipped in the Gulf of Mexico. Six people were rescued. The NTSB said in Tuesday’s report that the captain of the Seacor Power made a “reasonable” decision to get underway the day of the disaster. But he didn’t have sufficient weather information from the lift boat company. “Additionally, due to a Coast Guard broadcasting station outage, the SEACOR Power crew did not receive a National Weather Service Special Marine Warning notifying mariners of a severe thunderstorm that was approaching,” the report said.\n\nMaine\n\nMachias: A longtime law enforcement officer and former candidate for sheriff in Washington County has been sentenced to four years in prison for drug- and gun-related charges. The case against Jeffrey Bishop, 55, unfolded with his arrest for providing opioid pills to a teenage girl last year in a high school parking lot. Prosecutors said the drugs were meant for the girl’s mother. He told the judge Monday that he was “very humble” and a “very broken man” but said he wasn’t fully satisfied with the plea agreement, the Bangor Daily News reported. He also said he was “baffled” that his police background was considered an aggravating factor when it came to his sentencing. He was arrested less than a week after he retired from the Calais Police Department last year. In his resignation letter, Bishop said he “decided to go out on top,” after a long career in law enforcement.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Gov. Larry Hogan and other political and business leaders Tuesday toured the Hitachi Rail factory being built in Washington County. “The job creation potential and associated economic benefits are an absolute game-changer for this region and for the entire state,” the Republican governor said in remarks before the tour. “This project is further proof that the Hagerstown region is a major logistical center for transportation with unparalleled connections to the northeastern United States.” Hitachi also unveiled the final design of the $70 million factory, which will employ about 460 people and help sustain a total of 1,300 jobs in the region. The 307,000-square-foot facility is being build at the west end of Halfway Boulevard, which the county plans to extend to Greencastle Pike (Md. 63). The 41-acre site also will include an 800-foot test track. Hogan called it a “transformative project.” Construction is slated to be finished in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A Hindu rights activist is calling on a museum to stop selling children’s plush toys representing three Hindu deities. Toys depicting Lord Krishna, Lord Ganesh and Lord Hanuman were available on the Peabody Essex Museum’s online shop last week but had been removed by Tuesday, Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, said in a statement. The deities are “greatly revered in Hinduism and were meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to be thrown around loosely on the floor, bathrooms, cars, etc.” Zed said. He also called for a formal apology from the museum. The Peabody Essex Museum halted sales of the toys while it reviewed the complaint, spokesperson Whitney Van Dyke said in an email. “These items will be back on sale shortly,” she said. The museum pointed out that the toys are widely available and are manufactured by New Jersey-based Modi Toys, founded by an Indian American family. They are intended to spark curiosity in Hindu culture and heritage, company co-founder Avani Modi Sarkar said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: A man who got out of his car after striking a deer was killed by another vehicle, authorities said. The 33-year-old Shepherd man was hit Monday when the driver of the second car swerved to avoid a crash on U.S. 127, near Mount Pleasant, investigators said. Conditions were dark and misty. The lights on Joshua Davis’ Ford Focus “had been disabled from the deer accident and were not working,” the Isabella County sheriff’s office said. The driver of the other vehicle, a 77-year-old woman from Lansing, was taken to an emergency room for an evaluation, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: The Mall of America is testing metal detectors at one entrance following two incidents of gunfire and an armed robbery within the last year. Mall spokeswoman Laura Utecht said Tuesday the trial is taking place over the next month at the mall’s north doors, although that could change as testing continues. She declined to say what shoppers should avoid trying to carry through the metal detectors, the Star Tribune reported. “With Mall of America being such a unique property, it is important to thoroughly evaluate this technology onsite to ensure its accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency,” Utecht said in a statement, adding that the mall is testing a variety of security options. The Mall of America bans guns, according to its website, but the shopping center has never had metal detectors or searched bags. The mall, which opened in 1992, is the largest in the U.S. and is a tourist destination and community gathering spot. Two gun incidents took place in August. In one, a man robbed two stores and was apprehended with a loaded rifle. About three weeks earlier, a man fired shots in the midst of a fight among four other people. There were no injuries in either case. A shooting last New Year’s Eve left two people wounded following a dispute on the mall’s third floor.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An employee of a wastewater hauling company pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday for his part in illegally discharging industrial waste into the capital city’s sewer system. William Roberts, an employee of Partridge-Sibley Industrial Services, admitted to supervising the improper disposal of industrial waste at a commercial entity in Jackson. As a result of Roberts’s negligence, the waste was trucked and hauled to a facility that was not a legal discharge point designated to receive the waste, federal prosecutors said. “The defendant’s negligent conduct contributed to the discharge of millions of gallons of untreated industrial waste into the Jackson water system,” said Chuck Carfagno, a special agent for the Environmental Protection Agency’s criminal investigations division. Jackson’s water and sewer system has been beset by troubles dating back years. The water system was recently engulfed in a crisis that forced people in the city of 150,000 to go days without running water in late August and early September. An attorney for Roberts did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He will be sentenced on December 14, 2022.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Six students and two adults were taken to a hospital for evaluation after a carbon monoxide leak was detected Wednesday at an elementary school, officials said. The eight people taken to hospitals from Longfellow Elementary School suffered nausea and dizziness but none suffered life-threatening issues, Assistant Fire Chief Jimmy Walker said. Emergency responders went to the school after several students reporting feeling ill. Firefighters found “extremely high” levels of the lethal gas inside the building, Walker said. The level of carbon monoxide reached 2,000 parts per million, which was the maximum for monitors used by firefighters at the scene, Walker said. The cause of the leak is under investigation. Firefighters were ventilating the building but it was unclear when students could return to Longfellow. School district spokesperson Elle Moxley said the district had contractors check its heating systems last week, including at Longfellow, in anticipation of colder weather. No problems were detected, she said. Moxley said every child was checked and the district will work with the fire department before determining where Longfellow students will attend school this week.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A suspect who is accused of leading law enforcement on a vehicle chase through two counties on Monday has been charged with five felonies in Cascade County District Court. He is being held on a $500,000 bond. Santana Ledeau is charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of assault on a peace officer and one count of criminal endangerment. Cascade County Attorney Josh Racki said on Monday that Ledeau will likely face more charges as the investigation continues. That investigation, Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said, will be conducted by the Montana Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation due to the many agencies involved.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say improperly discarded cigarettes led to a fire in a home’s garage and caused $75,000 worth of damage, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Lincoln Fire and Rescue Capt. Nancy Crist said the fire started after the resident emptied an ashtray into a garbage can. The blaze was contained to the garage and no one was injured, according to the news outlet.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Republican Secretary of State candidate Jim Marchant is the only statewide candidate who has yet to file his campaign finance report, having missed Monday’s deadline. A central duty of the secretary of state’s office is administering elections, handling campaign finance reports and enforcing reporting deadlines for contribution and expenditure reports. The secretary of state also registers corporations and limited liability companies and represents the third highest ranking state official behind the governor and lieutenant governor. Marchant’s campaign did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office declined to comment. Campaign reporting deadlines normally fall on the 15th of the month for April, July, October and January. But since it fell on a Saturday this month, the deadline was moved to Monday at 5 p.m. Marchant had not filed by late afternoon Tuesday. If the report is filed one to seven days late, the candidate must pay a $25 daily fee. For eight to 15 days late, the penalty is $50 a day. And if the report is filed more than 15 days late, it is $100 a day the up to a maximum of $10,000. Marchant is among the America First Secretary of State Coalition candidates who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election and vow to scrap early voting and vote-counting tabulators.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLondonderry: The publisher of a weekly newspaper has waived her arraignment, pleading not guilty to charges that she published advertisements for local races without properly marking them as political advertising, the state attorney general’s office said. The six misdemeanor charges allege that Debra Paul, publisher of The Londonderry Times, failed to identify the ads with “appropriate language” indicating that they were ads and saying who paid for them as required by state law, the attorney general’s office said in August after reviewing cases that go back to 2019. Paul, who’s also a member of the town council in Londonderry, said in a statement at the time, “This is clearly a case of a small business needing to defend itself against overreaching government.” A police affidavit said altogether, nearly 60 violations in the Times and a related publication were counted between 2020 and this year. Paul, who along with her husband are the only two employees at the paper, said she originally believed the state’s complaint involved advertising rates, the affidavit said. Her attorney did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMadison: A former federal prosecutor-turned-producer and a media production company who used Drew University as their backdrop to film a movie about a prestigious college littered with hazing and prejudice is being sued by the school, who claims they filmed and dashed without paying their bill. Executive producer Traci Bransford and her production company Meadowcrest Films and Think Global Media, a company with studios across the nation, used the Morris County private school earlier this year to film “The Choices We Make.” But when it was time to remit payment of over $130,000, Bransford apparently had plenty of excuses why the money was being delayed, according to the lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in Morris County earlier this month. The university names Think Global Media owner Nathan Scinto in the suit due to his partnership with Bransford, but Scinto’s attorney Richard Roth said Tuesday it was “aggressive lawyering” and that there is “absolutely no basis” to go after his client or his company. The facilities and services agreement, which Roth said he obtained, was with Meadowcrest Films. Roth said he plans to file a motion to remove his client from the suit if the university’s attorney does not agree to remove him prior. He also noted that he does not believe there is jurisdiction in New Jersey since his client’s company is not connected to the state. A number listed for Bransford was disconnected and there was no response to an email request for comment. No attorney is listed for her.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWinston: Environmentalists are pushing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do more to protect Mexican gray wolves after one of the endangered predators was found dead in southwestern New Mexico. The Western Watersheds Project is among the groups that have been critical of the agency’s management of wolves in New Mexico and Arizona, saying illegal killings continue to hamper the population. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service says there have been fewer wolves found dead this year than in previous years. The agency also pointed to a revised recovery plan for the wolf that was released in early October. The agency was under a court order to revamp the plan to address the threat of human-caused mortality as one of the ways to increase survivability for wolves in the wild. Federal officials said they could not provide any details about the circumstances of the latest death since it was an ongoing investigation. It’s rare that such investigations are ever closed. Environmentalists described the male wolf recently found dead near Winston as one of the most genetically-valuable Mexican wolves in the wild. It had been released in 2018 after being born in captivity and then cross-fostered into a wild wolf den as part of an effort to increase genetic diversity.\n\nNew York\n\nMiller Place: Authorities rescued nearly 300 rabbits, birds and other animals from a filthy home and charged a self-help book author with cruel confinement of animals, prosecutors announced. “Operation Open Cage” started Oct. 1 when investigators were contacted by animal control officers who reported a hoarding situation in the hamlet of Miller Place on Long Island, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said. Officers wearing hazardous material suits found a total of 118 rabbits, 150 birds, 15 cats, seven tortoises, three snakes and several mice living among filth, many surrounded by their own feces and urine and covered with cockroaches, the district attorney said. The owner of the home, Karin Keyes, 51, was charged with multiple counts of cruel confinement of animals. She’s a social worker and the author of a self-published book titled “Journey Into Awareness: Reclaiming Your Life.” Information on Keyes’ attorney wasn’t available. A phone message was left at a number listed for her. Teams from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals helped the district attorney’s Biological, Environmental and Animal Safety Team and local officers in removing and transporting the animals to animal welfare organizations around New York for medical care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic legislators pleaded with the General Assembly’s Republican majority on Tuesday to consider gun safety and mental health measures, citing last week’s shootings in Raleigh that left five people dead. Democratic lawmakers, one a resident of the east Raleigh subdivision where the shooting rampage began last Thursday, said the public expects elected officials to work together to pass laws designed to make them safer. “This is an issue that transcends party. It’s an issue about our safety, the safety of our children, the safety of our state,” Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said at a news conference. Blue has lived in the Hedingham community where the shootings occurred for over 30 years “and never felt that I would be unsafe in the community where we raised our kids until last week.” Previous Democratic requests for Republicans to permit debate and votes on gun-control measures and others to keep weapons out of the hands of people at extreme risk of becoming violent have been unsuccessful. “My question today is now the time for a discussion of gun reform, or do we have to wait yet for another mass shooting?” said Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Wake County Democrat. House Speaker Tim Moore, a Cleveland County Republican, said in a statement later Tuesday that lawmakers for now “should remain focused on praying for the victims’ families and supporting law enforcement rather than seizing the moment for a political debate.” “We need to allow law enforcement to complete their investigation before jumping to any conclusions about policy changes,” Moore added.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state health department stored thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses at incorrect temperatures or without temperature data over the past two years, according to a state audit Tuesday that said some of the vaccine was administered to patients. The health department disputed the findings. Tim Wiedrich, who heads the agency’s virus response, said “no non-viable vaccine” was given to patients. In responses that accompanied the audit, the department said clerical errors or other errors of documentation erroneously suggested that expired or bad doses were given. “DoH uses redundant systems to ensure proper monitoring and distribution of vaccines prior to end of shelf life,” the agency said. A spokeswoman for the auditor’s office said it wasn’t recommending revaccinations. “We simply report on what we found,” auditor’s office spokeswoman Emily Dalzell said. “It would be up to the individual and their doctor to decide if revaccination is needed.” The state analysis said nearly 2,000 Moderna doses were stored at incorrect temperatures and were administered to patients. The audit also found that nearly 13,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccines were issued from storage with missing temperature data. The audit covered a two-year span that ended June 30. An inventory of the vaccines was conducted on Aug. 8, 2021, the audit said.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday removed from the bench a Cleveland municipal judge for misconduct and conducting court business “in a manner befitting a game show host,” investigators said. Judge Pinkey S. Carr was indefinitely suspended, and she agreed to undergo evaluations for her mental and physical health. The court said that Carr’s bench was littered with junk, dolls, cups and novelty items - her own attorney described it as “resembling a flea market.” She wore tank tops, T-shirts, spandex shorts and sneakers to court. And she discussed with staff and defendants a television show called “P-Valley” about a fictional Mississippi strip club. Carr joked about accepting kickbacks for lenient sentences if defendants gave her food, beverages, carpeting or storage space. She referred to her bailiff as “Miss Puddin from P-Valley.” In addition to a lack of decorum, Carr was found to have violated a long list of other rules.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday set a statewide election for March 7 for voters to decide whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, a question Democrats had hoped would be on the November ballot to help energize liberal voters. Oklahomans for Sensible Marijuana Laws gathered enough signatures to qualify the question for a statewide vote and thought the proposal would be on the ballot in November. But because it took longer than usual to count the signatures and for courts to consider legal challenges, there wasn’t enough time to print the ballots ahead of the November election. If approved by voters, the question would legalize the use of marijuana for any adult over the age of 21. Marijuana sales would be subjected to a 15% excise tax on top of the standard sales tax, and the revenue it generates would be used to help fund local municipalities, the court system, public schools, substance abuse treatment and the state’s general revenue fund. The proposal also outlines a judicial process for people to seek expungement or dismissal of prior marijuana-related convictions. Oklahoma already has one of the most robust medical marijuana programs in the country, with roughly 10% of the state’s residents having state-issued medical cards that allow them to purchase, grow and consume marijuana. Stitt said that while he supports the federal legalization of marijuana, he opposes the state question, saying the country’s patchwork of state laws on marijuana has become problematic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters said she’ll retire at the end of the year. Walters, who became the first woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2018, is the second justice this month to announce a retirement, giving Democrat Gov. Kate Brown two appointments to the state’s high court before she leaves office, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “I have loved the job of advocating for our courts and the critical need for access to the services we provide,” Walters said during remarks at a judicial conference where she made the announcement. Walters’ plan to retire comes amid an uncertain political future for the state because of the November gubernatorial election. With unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson likely to draw votes, polls have indicated that Republican candidate Christine Drazan and Democratic Tina Kotek are locked in a tight race. By retiring, Walters has ensured Brown will name a replacement who is likely to be aligned with Walters’ jurisprudence.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Newsroom workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette have gone on strike demanding that the company reinstate the terms of its previous contract and return to the bargaining table. The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh said its members began picketing Tuesday outside the newsroom on the city’s North Shore and planned to continue the action Wednesday. Guild members have been working without a contract since 2017 and Monday voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike against the company. On Oct. 6, workers from unions that are responsible for production, distribution and advertising at the Post-Gazette walked off the job. The Post-Gazette said in a statement that it would “continue to serve the Pittsburgh community, our readers and advertisers, despite any work stoppage.” Officials said they were confident the company would prevail when the National Labor Relations Board rules on the unfair labor practice accusation. The walkout is the first major newspaper strike in the city in three decades. In 1992, WESA reports, about 600 members of a Teamsters local representing truck drivers and circulation route managers went on strike against the Pittsburgh Press, which ended up being sold and merged with the Post-Gazette.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: An orphaned bobcat found in the kitchen of a Glocester camp will soon return to the wild, said Arianna Mouradjian, director of operations at the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island, in North Kingstown. With an increase in the bobcat population in the state over the last two decades, the Saunderstown clinic has in recent years received several bobcats in need of its rehabilitative services, Mouradjian said. Still, she said, “Bobcats are one of those species we don’t see a lot of.” The most recent guest was rescued July 23 from Aldersgate Camp and Retreat Center in Glocester at about six weeks old. Bobcat kittens typically stay with their mothers 9 to 12 months. Through the end of summer and beginning of fall, she has lived in her own outdoor pen as the clinic staff give her time to grow big enough to fend for herself in the wild.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreer: BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start building electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement Wednesday reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years. In addition, BMW said it has signed a deal with Envision AESC of Japan to supply battery cells for a new class of at least six electric SUVs that will be built at BMW’s plant in Greer by 2030. Envision will build its new factory at an unspecified site in South Carolina. The companies wouldn’t say how many people will be hired. But the number of jobs could be significant: Battery cell plants being built by other companies will employ between 1,100 and 2,200 workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A monkey with the Great Plains Zoo is recovering after facing recent surgery because of an injury sustained after the animal picked up a bottle cap someone threw in its enclosure. Kai, the Japanese macaque, had surgery Tuesday, according to a social media post by the zoo. He picked up a bottle top that had been tossed into the snow monkey exhibit, and tucked it into his cheek pouch. Eventually, the bottle cap wore its way through the cheek and needed to be removed. Despite the carefulness of the zoo’s veterinary team, he will have a scar, according to the post. The zoo posted details’s about Kai’s experience as a PSA for visitors to avoid future incidents. Objects the animal care team place in exhibits as enrichment are chosen with species-specific requirements in mind, according to the post. The zoo asked visitors if they drop something in by mistake, tell a zoo employee immediately.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Early voting kicked off Wednesday for the November midterm general election. The 14-day period of voting ahead of the Nov. 8 Election Day runs Mondays through Saturdays until Thursday, Nov. 3. The ballot features Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s reelection bid against Democrat Jason Martin, four constitutional amendments, U.S. House contests and state legislative races. Additionally, Tennessee’s deadline to request an absentee ballot to vote by mail is Nov. 1. Those ballots must be returned by mail in time for the county election commission to receive it no later than the close of polls on Election Day. The deadline to register to vote in the general election has passed. Voters can get more info at GoVoteTN.gov. Tennessee heads into the election with 4.55 million registered voters, an increase of about 127,800 since December 2021, according to the Tennessee secretary of state’s office.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: Former President Donald Trump plans a rally in what is shaping up as competitive South Texas on Saturday, just two days before the start of early voting ahead of the Nov. 8 elections. Trump, who in May was in Houston for a gathering of the National Rifle Association and two weeks earlier was in Austin as part of his “Save America Tour,” will be at the Richard M. Borchard Regional Fairgrounds in Robstown, about 20 miles west of Corpus Christi. In an advisory, Trump said he wants to “energize voters” by reminding them of the number of Republican candidates he has endorsed who have gone on to win elections, or at least their GOP primaries. During the March primaries, Trump endorsed Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, all of whom face competitive races from Democrats this cycle.\n\nUtah\n\nZion National Park: Thirty-three immigrants gathered beneath Zion’s iconic 1,000-foot sandstone cliffs for the park’s first-ever naturalization ceremony on Tuesday. It was an unusual setting for a ceremony typically confined to courtrooms or office space run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service in Salt Lake City. For residents of southwestern Utah, the locale meant they could avoid the four-hour trip north. “I’m so grateful for this moment, for my family,” said St. George resident Brenda Corsi, originally from Huacho, Peru. “I know that we have an amazing future.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Supreme Court has rejected a request for bail from a man considered a person of interest in the shooting deaths of a couple in Concord, New Hampshire. In its Tuesday decision, the court unanimously rejected an appeal filed by attorneys for Logan Clegg, who was arrested last week in Vermont as a fugitive from justice from Utah. Clegg’s attorneys had argued he could not be held without bail prior to trial because the charge he is facing does not carry a potential sentence of life in prison. But the Vermont Supreme Court rejected that argument, saying that under Vermont law Clegg is not being held prior to trial, but as a fugitive from justice. When Clegg, 26, and homeless, was arrested by local police after being spotted detectives from Concord, South Burlington described him as a person of interest in an unsolved April homicide in Concord. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office said police made contact in Vermont with a person of interest the April killings of Stephen and Djeswende Reid, but they didn’t name the person. No arrests have been made or charges filed in the killings. Clegg’s arrest on a fugitive from justice charge included a probation violation.\n\nVirginia\n\nWaynesboro: Police arrested a man over the weekend, charging him with attempted murder in Waynesboro, a press release said. Gage W. Mayne, 26, no fixed address, is facing charges of attempted second-degree murder, use of a firearm while attempting to commit murder, aggravated malicious wounding and four counts of obstruction of justice, the Waynesboro Police Department said. On Sunday morning shortly after midnight, Waynesboro officers responded to an address in the 2500 block of Village Drive. When police arrived, they encountered a 27-year-old man with what appeared to be a gunshot wound, the release said. During a preliminary investigation, officers identified Mayne as a suspect. He had already fled the scene in a vehicle. The vehicle Mayne was reportedly driving was found on the northeast side of Waynesboro. Police said Mayne was inside. He was placed into police custody without incident. Mayne is being held without bond at Middle River Regional Jail.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The air quality west of the Cascades has deteriorated again as wildfires continue to burn. The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency sent out an alert Tuesday afternoon saying the smoke around Seattle was causing unhealthy air and that people should close windows and limit time outdoors. Other areas around Puget Sound were experiencing air considered unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse, the agency said. The smoke-laden air gave the Pacific Northwest the designation of worst air quality in the U.S. on Tuesday, KGW Meteorologist Joe Raineri said. Nine fires were burning in Washington and Oregon before a red flag warning for critical fire conditions was issued over the weekend. Some new fires started while the Nakia Creek Fire in southwest Washington took off, causing much of the smoky air seen around southwest Washington and Portland, officials said. In the Pacific Northwest, relief should come Friday. “Friday through Saturday will be cooler and more seasonable and we’ll finally get that rain. I think everyone’s excited about that,” National Weather Service meteorologist Kayla Mazurkiewicz told The Seattle Times. “We should have had a couple of inches by now.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: A man has been charged in a woman’s 1993 slaying in the state, police said. Ricky Louie Woody, 59, of Billings, Montana, was charged earlier this month in the March 1993 death of Melissa Martinez in Huntington. She had a gunshot wound to the torso, lacerations to the head and died at a hospital, police said in a news release Tuesday. Witnesses initially provided information that led detectives to Woody, but there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Woody moved from Huntington to Billings within a year of Martinez’s death, the statement said. Billings detectives contacted Huntington police in May 2021 and indicated Woody told them he knew the person responsible for killing a woman known to him as “Lisa” in the early 1990s. Woody ultimately admitted he participated in her death, the statement said. Huntington detectives determined Woody was referring to the death of Martinez and interviewed him in September 2021 at a Billings jail, leading to the charges. Woody has waived extradition and will be returned to Huntington upon the resolution of the case in Montana, police said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAshland County: A man whose 5-year-old daughter and her mother were killed in a car crash involving the state Senate’s minority leader has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the lawmaker. Brandon Fink, whose daughter Khaleesi Fink and the girl’s mother, Alyssa Ortman, were killed in the July crash, filed the lawsuit Friday in Ashland County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Court documents show that the family lived in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, names Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, another driver and three insurance companies as defendants. Bewley, who represents a state Senate district that covers northwestern Wisconsin, pulled out of a Lake Superior beach entrance in Ashland on July 22 and into the path of a car driven by Ortman, according to police. When Ortman’s car collided with Bewley’s, it spun across Highway 2 and was hit by a vehicle driven by Jodi Munson, 45, of Washburn. Ortman’s 5-year-old daughter was pronounced dead at the crash scene. Ortman later died at a hospital, according to police. The Ashland police report, obtained by The Associated Press, says Bewley was distracted by her hands-free mobile phone at the time of the crash. The lawsuit alleges that all three drivers acted negligently. Bewley’s spokesperson, Joey Huey, said the state senator would have no comment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A college wrestler helped his teammate survive a grizzly mauling over the weekend by trying to wrestle the massive bear off his friend, eventually drawing a more brutal attack to himself. The men are crediting their bonds as wrestling teammates at Northwest College in Cody, Wyoming, with helping them survive the attack Saturday evening southeast of Yellowstone National Park. Brady Lowry of Cedar City, Utah, suffered a broken arm and puncture wounds in the initial attack after they surprised the bear while searching for antlers shed by elk and deer in the Shoshone National Forest. “It shook me around and I didn’t know what to do,” Lowry told KSL-TV Monday in an interview from a hospital in Billings, Montana. “I curled up in a ball and it got me a few more times.” His teammate – Kendell Cummings of Evanston, Wyoming – tried to stop the attack on Lowry by yelling, kicking and hitting the bear and pulling on its fur. Wyoming wildlife officials said they will not try to capture and relocate or kill the bear because it was a surprise attack and because there are many other bears in the area, making it difficult for them to determine which bear was involved.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2023/07/05/feds-approve-first-offshore-wind-farm-in-nj/70385778007/", "title": "Feds approve first offshore wind farm in NJ", "text": "New Jersey's first offshore wind energy project — and the third approved by the federal government — received approval on Wednesday from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM.\n\nThe project, known as Ocean Wind 1, will be run by Denmark-based power company Ørsted and be built about 15 miles off the coast. The project will generate enough electricity to power about 500,000 homes, according to the company.\n\n\"Since Day One, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to jump-start the offshore wind industry across the country — and today’s approval for the Ocean Wind 1 project is another milestone in our efforts to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,\" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the announcement marked a \"pivotal inflection point\" in the state's transition toward carbon-free power.\n\nProponents of offshore wind say climate change is a dangerous threat to New Jersey's marine and coastal ecosystems as well as millions of residents: Through warming oceans that will lead to worse storms and more frequent flooding, ocean acidification that will kill marine animals, and disruptions in migration routes and feeding and breeding areas.\n\nWarming ocean temperatures could also slow down critical circulation currents within the Atlantic Ocean and lead to changes in how heat moves between the equator and poles, potentially changing climates across portions of the Earth, according to NASA.\n\nProponents of offshore wind say reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas through the transition to carbon-free energy is an essential part of slowing climate change and protecting critical ecosystems around the world.\n\n\"The project's approval demonstrates the federal government's commitment to developing clean energy and fighting climate change and is a testament to the state of New Jersey's leadership in supporting sustainable sources of energy and economic development for coastal communities,\" BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein said in a statement.\n\nFederal officials said Ocean Wind 1 will have to adhere to regulations designed to protect endangered and threatened marine animals, including enforcing vessel speed limits and funding various animal monitoring programs.\n\nYet offshore wind has become a source of controversy in New Jersey, pitting politicians against one another down party lines and even dividing some environmental groups over its potential marine impacts.\n\nCritics of offshore wind say construction of wind farms will kill marine animals and disrupt the migrations of whales and other important species. They say the farms will place thousands of acres of important fishing grounds off limits and destroy livelihoods in the fisheries business, particularly among clam and scallop harvesters who trawl the seafloor. The bases of wind turbines will likely make trawling too dangerous to pursue in these areas, according to scallop and surf clam harvesters.\n\nRead more:Should NJ's fishing community be compensated for offshore wind losses?\n\nCritics also say many in the fishing community will spend more time and fuel reaching fishing grounds farther away because of the turbine farms.\n\nScot Mackey, who represents Garden State Seafood before Trenton lawmakers, said he was not surprised by the announcement.\n\n\"This will impact specifically surf clams in the region where there's historic catches, and there's a significant concern for those that are fishing out of Barnegat Light and Atlantic City that are transiting out to other fishing grounds,\" he said. \"To date, there has been no real effort to address our concerns, the mitigation or minimization, or any of it.\"\n\nBut others in the fishing community say wind farms will be a boon for anglers, because the turbine bases will act like reefs and attract a variety of fish species.\n\nDepartment of Interior officials said Ocean Wind 1's approval includes a provision for a commercial fisheries compensation program. The fund will offer reimbursement for lost revenue, a safety fund for navigational equipment, and money for lost or damaged fishing gear.\n\nYet opponents of the project are not giving up their efforts to stop Ocean Wind 1 from being constructed.\n\nEarlier this month, three New Jersey organizations — Save LBI, Defend Brigantine Beach and Protest Our Coast NJ —filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court to stop construction of the project.\n\nOcean Wind 1 will harm \"one of the most important marine communities on the East Coast and the core of New Jersey's $47 billion tourist industry,\" said Bruce Afran, an attorney for the three groups.\n\nHowever, state and federal officials are moving ahead with approvals. Last week, Trenton lawmakers voted to allow Ørsted to collect federal tax credits aimed at offshore wind farms.\n\nMurphy said BOEM's approval brings New Jersey a step closer toward its green energy goals.\n\n\"As we continue to cultivate burgeoning new industries while confronting the worsening climate crisis, our state’s first offshore wind project will generate thousands of good-paying union jobs and considerable environmental benefits for generations to come,\" he said.\n\nAmanda Oglesby is an Ocean County native who covers Brick, Barnegat and Lacey townships as well as the environment.

Kay Ivey says she should not have worn blackface in a college skit decades ago, but she does not plan to resign over something that happened so long in the past. In her first public appearance since issuing a public apology last week, Ivey, 74, reiterated that she was wrong to appear in the skit over 50 years ago and said it does not reflect who she is today. The Republican governor said she has no plans to quit. “Heavens no, I’m not going to resign. It’s something that happened 52 years ago, and I’m not that person. My administration stands on being inclusive and helping people,” Ivey said. Her admission and her office’s release of a video of her then-fiance describing the skit in 1967 came after she had said in February that she had never worn blackface. Ivey said Tuesday that she doesn’t remember the skit.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Expected rate increases in the state’s assisted living facility system have already prompted the departure of some residents. KTUU-TV reports the rate increases at Alaska Pioneer Home went into effect Sept. 1. Officials say new regulations increased the number of tiers in the Pioneer Home care system from three to five, based on residents’ levels of need. Officials say the highest tier previously priced at about $6,800 per month has increased to $15,000 monthly. The state Department of Health and Social Services says it previously covered the difference between what residents paid and the actual cost, while the new rate covers the full cost. The department says eight residents have left some of the six Alaska Pioneer Homes after the rate increases went into effect.\n\nArizona\n\nTsaile: Researchers at the University of Arizona and Dine College are partnering to try to get more Navajo students into biomedical sciences. The schools recently were awarded a $1.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. Kathleen Rogers and Roberta Diaz Brinton from UofA and Fred Boyd from Dine College will develop a training program for Navajo students to further their studies in neuroscience. They say Native Americans make up 0.5% of the workforce in biomedical sciences – the lowest of any minority group. The students will work with Navajo elders while learning science research methods. The researchers say the approach recognizes that Native American students might have different perspectives in trying to address health disparities.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The police department has received more than 100 threats after a 911 dispatcher scolded a frantic newspaper delivery woman for driving into floodwaters before she drowned. Fort Smith police spokesman Aric Mitchell says the threats over the holiday weekend were made primarily to the city’s dispatch center from out-of-state callers and aren’t considered credible. He told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that calls and messages ranged from vague insults to death threats. In a 911 recording released last week, Debra Stevens was heard crying and begging for help, saying she could not swim. Dispatcher Donna Reneau at one point tried to comfort Stevens but also told her, “This will teach you next time don’t drive in the water.” Reneau was working her final shift when she took the call Aug. 24 and is no longer employed by the department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Organizers of the annual surf contest in the massive waves of Mavericks in Northern California say they are canceling the competition indefinitely. The World Surf League says logistical challenges and the inability to run the event the past two years prompted it to cancel it this year. WSL produces some of the world’s best-known surf contests and in 2017 bought the rights to the Titans of Mavericks big wave surf contest after its original organizer filed for bankruptcy. It changed its name to the Mavericks Challenge. If the surf was right, the contest was held in 25-foot-plus waves at the Mavericks’ break near Pillar Point in Half Moon Bay between Nov. 1 and March 31. The contest was called off in 2017 and 2018.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Country music star Dierks Bentley has been fined $139.50 for fishing without a license after concertgoers reported him to state officials. The Denver Post reports Bentley and fellow country star Luke Bryan talked on stage about fishing during a festival in Buena Vista. Officials say audience members contacted the Colorado Parks and Wildlife department to check whether the singers had fishing licenses. Officials say the reports alone were not enough to warrant action, but Bentley posted online proof Sunday. A photo posted on social media shows Bentley holding a brown trout in Cottonwood Creek in the central Colorado town. A parks and wildlife spokesman says an officer located Bentley in Buena Vista on Monday and issued a ticket. Bentley paid the fine in cash on the spot.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: The public is invited to attend a ceremony marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The event will be held Thursday at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, beginning at 5:30 p.m. Family members of those killed in the 2001 attacks will participate. The names of the 161 victims with ties to Connecticut will be read aloud. Connecticut holds its ceremony early so family members can attend the annual service in New York City on Sept. 11. Connecticut’s official memorial honoring the victims is located on a peninsula at the state park where the Manhattan skyline can be seen on a clear day across Long Island Sound. The site was used by the Connecticut National Guard as a staging area for the state’s relief efforts.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Lawmakers have introduced a bill authorizing restaurants and beer gardens to allow pets in outdoor seating areas. The bill introduced last week was prompted by a public reminder from state health officials last month that there is a regulation prohibiting pets in restaurants, including patio areas. Officials have acknowledged, however, that the regulation has not been strictly enforced. The regulation came as a surprise to Democratic House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf of Rehoboth Beach, a popular beach town where residents and visitors often take their dogs with them when grabbing an outdoor bite. Schwartzkopf introduced a bipartisan bill that allows owners of food establishments and beer gardens to permit leashed dogs in outdoor areas.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some high schoolers in the district are piloting a student safety app that will allow them to report suspicious activity, contact law enforcement and share live commute updates. The Washington Post reports students at Thurgood Marshall Academy Public Charter High School started piloting the app Thursday. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration announced plans for the app last month and said the district planned to spend about $26,000 to partner on it with LiveSafe, a Virginia-based tech company. The newspaper notes the app is the district’s response to students’ pleas for safer commutes and says students seemed the most excited for the commute update feature. Officials say it could take up to two more months to release the app. It still is unclear to whom students’ concerns will be directed through the app.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state saw more than a 5% increase in tourists in the first half of the year, but visits from international travelers were down. Figures released by Visit Florida, the state tourism promotion agency, show 68.9 million visitors came to Florida from January through June, the largest number of visitors during any six-month period. More than 61 million visitors came from within the United States, and 7.6 million visitors came from outside the U.S. Excluding Canada, the number of international visitors was down by about 2%. That is part of a nationwide trend blamed on competition and trade tensions. Visitor Florida also updated last year’s figures. The tourism agency says 127 million visitors came to Florida in 2018, 1 million more than originally reported.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The rapper Future has promised to give a $2,000 scholarship and pair of concert tickets to a fan at each stop on his Legendary Nights tour. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports eligible fans must be active area college students who follow Future’s FreeWishes Foundation on Instagram and submit an essay on how the scholarship would “be a dream come true.” The website says the Atlanta rapper and his family launched the nonprofit to deliver messages of hope by “making dreams come alive.” Future, whose real name is Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, is touring 24 cities with Meek Mill and Megan Thee Stallion. The tour started in St. Louis, Missouri, and ends in Atlanta this month. Applications are due before the tour stops in each applicant’s city.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state attorney general’s office won’t go after Bank of America for failing to provide $150 million in loans for building houses on Hawaiian home lands. Bank of America had committed to the loans as a condition of its 1994 acquisition of Liberty Bank in Hawaii. Last year, Gov. David Ige wrote a letter to a bank official saying the bank continues to be delinquent on its four-year commitment to provide the residential mortgage loans on the home lands, which are public lands for those with at least 50% Hawaiian blood. The bank says while it only made a fraction of the loans, it did fulfill its commitment – just not as originally conceived. The bank says it encountered challenges, including a lack of available lots to make loans in sufficient quantities and some borrowers not meeting loan qualifications.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of adopted wild horses in the state has increased as a result of a federal program intended to reduce wild horse overpopulation. KBOI-TV reports 230 horses have been adopted this year, compared to 150 horses in 2018. The federal Bureau of Land Management earlier this year announced it would pay up to $1,000 to people who adopt untrained wild horses. The bureau’s Boise district office says the program can assist new owners with initial expenses such as food and training. Officials say a wild horse and burro preparation facility supports four herd management areas in the state and holds horses for possible adoption. Officials say staff members at the corrals are available to help prospective owners select from among the 100 to 150 horses available there.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State officials are taking another step toward selling a downtown building that houses government offices. The Department of Central Management Services has issued a request for proposals seeking management and technical project management so Illinois can get “the best value” for the James R. Thompson Center. Responses are due Oct. 4. Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation this year authorizing the sale of the building that’s an architectural landmark but also has numerous efficiency issues. Selling the building is expected to take two years. Segments have fallen into disrepair, and there are issues with heating and cooling. State officials say it’s an expensive building to maintain. The 17-story, curved-glass structure was designed by architect Helmut Jahn and opened in 1985. It was renamed for Illinois’ longest-serving governor in 1993.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: Wildlife biologists have rescued thousands of freshwater mussels left stranded out of water by the demolition of a dam on the White River. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources scientists joined Muncie Sanitary District staff last week to collect by hand nearly 2,800 mussels representing 16 native species along the river at Muncie’s McCulloch Park. The mussels were relocated farther downstream. The recent demolition of a dam at the park lowered and narrowed the river, leaving the mussels stranded high and dry. Brant Fisher, a DNR aquatic biologist, says the agency was ready to give the mussels a lift because they “can’t move fast or far” and likely would have died.\n\nIowa\n\nHolland: Businesses partnering with the state to provide real-world student learning opportunities are expected to boost career education for rural school districts. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports the state is using the recently unveiled Iowa Clearinghouse for Work-Based Learning to help students build job skills. Iowa Department of Education Director Ryan Wise says it’s designed as a virtual workspace. Businesses, nonprofits and governmental organizations can post real-world tasks on a project board that students can then complete under the supervision of teachers. Teachers can also use it to connect students to job shadow, internship and apprenticeship opportunities. Wise says the program will broaden access to learning that hasn’t been available for some students, especially those in rural areas.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A government snapshot of crop conditions shows the harvest of corn is now underway in the state. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Tuesday that 1% of the corn in the state has been harvested, near the 4% average at this point in the growing season. The agency rates half of the corn out in fields in good to excellent condition, with 34% of the crop in fair shape. About 16% is in poor to very poor condition. Other crops are also making progress. About 83% of the soybeans in Kansas are setting pods, with 3% of soybean crops already dropping leaves. About 1% of the Kansas sorghum crop has now matured.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Children visiting Fort Boonesborough State Park this weekend can learn about life in the 18th century with hands-on lessons. Displays will include churning butter, grinding corn, baking ash cakes, carving powder horns, carding and spinning, and other pioneer skills. The Parks Department says concessions will be available, and there will be a puppet show featuring Punch and Judy and a demonstration on falconry. Displays will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. They are free with paid fort admission, which is $8 for adults, $5 for children ages 6 to 12, and free for children younger than 6. Fort Boonesborough is at the site of a fort built by Daniel Boone and other settlers in 1775 along the Kentucky River.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State residents can visit the National WWII Museum for half-price this month. In a news release, the museum says this is the fifth consecutive year it has cut prices for Louisiana residents. The discount also applies to rides on the museum’s restored PT-305 boat as well as tours. Residents have to show a valid Louisiana driver’s license in order to get the discount, which is only available for walk-up purchases. It does apply to group sales. The museum details the American experience in World War II. The museum’s newest exhibit tells the story of Andrew Jackson Higgins and Higgins Industries, which built the famed landing craft used during the Normandy invasion in 1944.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Moviegoers from the area who watch “It: Chapter Two” this weekend might recognize a scene that draws on a painful event from the state’s history. The scene involves a gay character being attacked by teenagers and his subsequent encounter with the killer clown Pennywise. The scene is based on real-life Bangor resident Charlie Howard, who was attacked and thrown off a bridge in 1984. Stephen King tells the Bangor Daily News that the killing was fresh on his mind when he was writing the book on which the movie is based. He says he was outraged. The scene is not included in the 1990 TV miniseries, but that changes with “It: Chapter Two,” with the character based on Howard being portrayed by Xavier Dolan.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A fashion exhibition with nearly 100 examples of women’s and men’s clothing and accessories spanning four centuries is scheduled to open at the Maryland Historical Society. The public will get to see the installation starting Oct. 6. The organization says the clothing has connections to presidents, royalty and everyday Marylanders. Among the pieces that will be on display is a gown worn to George Washington’s inaugural ball. The installation will also display clothing worn by slaves at Hampton Mansion, now a national historic site built in the 18th century north of Baltimore. The Historical Society says Christian Siriano, a Maryland native, will serve as the emcee of a fashion show the day before the exhibition opens to the public. “Spectrum of Fashion: Celebrating Maryland’s Style” will run through October 2020.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: With summer winding down, the cranberry bog harvest can’t be far behind. The head of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers’ Association, Brian Wick, says his members are largely optimistic about this year’s crop, but weather remains a variable. The USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service forecasts the total U.S. cranberry crop to hit 9 million barrels, a 4% increase over 2018. One barrel equals 100 pounds of cranberries. In Massachusetts, the second-largest cranberry producer behind Wisconsin, the crop is projected at 2.3 million barrels, up about 3% from last year. Wick says early September is a critical period for cranberries, which need both additional moisture and cooler nights to reach full size and develop their distinctive color. While most growers deploy supplemental irrigation systems, he says, “nothing beats a good soaking rain.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. is donating $4 million toward a project to expand a museum housed in the building where he built his music empire. Motown Museum announced Wednesday that Gordy’s gift is the largest individual donation to the project. It coincides with Motown’s 60th anniversary. Gordy said in a statement that he’s “excited about the future” of the museum and “happy to support it.” Museum expansion plans, announced in 2016, include interactive exhibits, a performance theater, recording studios, an expanded retail area and meeting spaces. Gordy launched the company in 1959 and moved it to Los Angeles in 1972. His late sister, Esther Gordy Edwards, launched the museum in the former “Hitsville U.S.A.” headquarters in 1985.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: City park officials say contaminated water led to a record number of beach closures this summer. Half of the city’s 12 beaches were not safe to swim in at various times during the summer. That’s the most since Minneapolis started a water sampling program in 2003, Minnesota Public Radio reports. Park officials say heavy rainfall was part of the problem. Officials say heavy rain brings in storm water runoff, and that runoff brings in debris and bacteria from streets and yards. But officials say goose droppings also contaminated the water at some beaches, as well as people with an illness who got in the water. Health officials are urging the public to stay out of the water if they’re sick and to wait a day to go in the beach after heavy rainfall.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge is taking charge of the state’s mental health system, saying the federal government has proved the state isn’t doing enough to serve people outside the confinement of mental hospitals. In a ruling late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves said he wants to appoint an outsider to oversee changes. He’s asking the state and federal governments to suggest someone for the role. The U.S. Justice Department argued during a monthlong trial this summer that Mississippi’s movement toward community services was far too slow, forcing hundreds or thousands of people into avoidable hospital stays. Reeves found that Mississippi is violating a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said “unjustified” mental hospital confinement is illegal. The judge rejects Mississippi’s arguments that it was progressing on its own.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A federal judge has ruled that a cattle farmer did not defame a Branson attraction by leaving a three-star TripAdvisor review. Owners of Bigfoot on the Strip sued Randy Winchester and his daughter in June 2018, claiming the review was libelous and defamatory. Winchester had written that he was disappointed by a tour of Bigfoot Farms and its cattle. Owners of the attraction contended some of the details in Winchester’s review were inaccurate. Winchester said after tour owner’s contacted him to complain, he changed it to a one-star review. U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beth Phillips ruled late last month that Winchester’s statements were factually correct and/or didn’t diminish the company’s reputation in the community.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Montana Secretary of State’s Office has decided how to distribute $750,000 in federal grant money to upgrade voting equipment across the state’s 56 counties. A statement by Secretary Corey Stapleton on Tuesday shows the amount per sub-grant will range from $3,500 for the smallest counties to $45,879 for Missoula County. The money is matched by an equal amount contributed by the counties. Stapleton says the money will help counties buy new voting machines for people with disabilities. Montana received $3 million total from the federal government to improve its election system and security. Some $2 million was earmarked for a new voter registration system. Another $150,000 is going toward information technology security, and $100,000 went toward the state’s election supervisor’s salary.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Farm Bureau estimates the ongoing trade dispute will cost the state’s farmers $943 million in lost revenue this year, though those losses will be partly offset by aid payments from the government. Bureau economist Jay Rempe says the lost revenue will add to the financial pressure on farmers in the state and hurt Nebraska’s economy because so many communities rely on farmers’ spending. University of Nebraska-Lincoln agricultural economist Brad Lubben estimates that Nebraska farmers will receive roughly $460 million in aid from the first half of this year’s $16 billion federal aid program. That would cover nearly half of the lost revenue. Additional aid payments are possible if the trade dispute with China lingers through the end of the year, but federal officials will decide that later.\n\nNevada\n\nPioche: A rural county has given final go-aheads to two events based around a “Storm Area 51” drive that began as an internet joke. Lincoln County commissioners on Tuesday accepted a promoter’s plan to hold a music festival for 5,000 people in tiny Hiko and an inn owner’s effort to let perhaps 10,000 camp on her property in Rachel, the town closest to the once top-secret Area 51 military base. The board last month drafted an emergency declaration, with the sheriff planning to team resources with the state and neighboring counties ahead of Sept. 20-22 events inspired by the internet invitation. Commissioners and Sheriff Kerry Lee say promoters’ plans to bring in food, water and entertainment could help people survive in the desolate desert nearly three hours’ drive from Las Vegas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: It’s been a great summer for piping plovers in the state. New Hampshire’s Fish and Game Department says a record number of state-endangered and federally threatened piping plovers hatched this summer at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. Five pairs nested on Hampton Beach fledged 10 chicks. On Seabrook Beach, six pairs of plovers fledged 10 chicks. Those numbers surpassed last year’s record of nine pairs and 17 chicks fledged, respectively. Biologist Brendan Clifford with the Nongame and Endangered Wildlife Program said birds born in New Hampshire have a good chance of returning to their native beaches after wintering farther south. The bird’s population has reached almost 2,000 pairs along the coast from North Carolina to Canada since it was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1986.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s top casino is taking out its checkbook again. The Borgata says it will spend $14 million redoing its lobby and more than 300 hotel suites. The work follows a $12 million project that opened a new sports betting lounge and entertainment facility in June. The latest renovation will redo the casino hotel’s lobby, adding a new bar and VIP check-in that should be completed this month. The Borgata also is renovating 312 suites, work that should be done by early next year. The top-performing of Atlantic City’s nine casinos, the Borgata regularly reinvests in its property. From January through July of this year, the Borgata has won more than $455 million, more than twice its nearest competitors.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Chile farmers in southern New Mexico say extreme shifts in weather have affected the harvest. Alonso Grajeda of Grajeda Farms says a cold snap early in the season and a later heat wave mean he won’t have as much green chile as in previous years. He says he had to replant, delaying the growth of his crops by about three weeks. Duane Gillis of Gillis Farms says his chiles are about two weeks behind schedule. But he says the best chile is being harvested now. New Mexico is known for its green chile grown in Hatch, where a festival celebrating the state vegetable was held over the weekend. The official state question is “red or green?”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A measles outbreak concentrated in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in the city is over, meaning an emergency order mandating vaccines will be lifted, health officials said Tuesday. The officials said two incubation periods since the last reported cases have passed without any new infections. But city Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot cautioned that there’s still a threat from “one of the most contagious diseases on the face of the earth” and urged New Yorkers to still get their children immunized before the start of the new school year. “Staying up to date on vaccines is the best way for people to protect the health and safety of their friends, family and neighbors,” Barbot said. The city has seen 654 cases of measles – the most in 30 years – since an outbreak began in October 2018, officials said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judicial panel rejected state legislative district maps Tuesday, saying legislators took extreme advantage in drawing voting districts to help elect a maximum number of Republican lawmakers. The judges gave lawmakers two weeks to try again. The three-judge panel of state trial judges unanimously ruled that courts can step in to decide when partisan advantage goes so far that it diminishes democracy. Their ruling comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June in a separate case involving North Carolina’s congressional map that it’s not the job of federal courts to decide if boundaries are politically unfair – though state courts could consider whether gerrymandering stands up under state laws and constitutions. “Partisan intent predominated over all other redistricting criteria resulting in extreme partisan gerrymandered legislative maps,” the judges wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Tribal leaders in the state gathered Tuesday to map out a campaign to help ensure their reservations aren’t shortchanged in the 2020 census. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith told the group during a tribal summit at United Tribes Technical College that his tribe has allocated $50,000 “for the purpose of helping get a true count.” The money will be used for advertising about the upcoming survey, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Faith said accurate numbers are important to get funding for road repairs, health, housing and schools, among other things. In addition to helping to determine federal spending, census numbers are used to determine seats in Congress and statehouses. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated American Indians and Alaska Natives were undercounted by 4.9% in the 2010 census.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Health officials say the number of fatal drug overdoses in the state has declined for the first time since 2009. Preliminary figures from the Ohio Department of Health show overdoses dropped more than 22% last year. According to separate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ohio’s decrease was more than four times the national decline of 5%. Health Department medical director Dr. Mark Hurst told the Columbus Dispatch he’s encouraged by the reduction, but the department’s “work is far from over.” State data shows that most of Ohio’s six largest urban areas had double-digit declines. Overdoses fell 47% in Montgomery County and 46% in Summit County.\n\nOklahoma\n\nSand Springs: Authorities say a suspect is dead following an officer-involved shooting. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation identified the suspect Monday as 49-year-old Robert Desjarlais Jr. Authorities say Desjarlais was fatally wounded about 8:30 p.m. Sunday in Sand Springs, about 7 miles west of Tulsa and 92 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Sand Springs Police Chief Mike Carter says shots were fired at the end of a pursuit involving a Sand Springs officer and Desjarlais. Carter says the officer was pinned against his vehicle during the incident and was transported to a local hospital for treatment and observation. The OSBI says Desjarlais was pronounced dead at the scene. The OSBI says the officer, who wasn’t immediately identified, has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: The city excavated 2,000 cubic yards of gravel and rock from McKay Creek right after the flooding in April. The East Oregonian reports now the city is seeking permits to clear thousands more cubic yards of gravel from the creek before the end of winter and the possibility of more spring flooding. City Manager Robb Corbett said the state allows that kind of in-stream work from Dec. 1 to March 31. He said they have a short time to get it done. But he expressed confidence in getting the permits during a meeting with McKay Creek area residents Wednesday night. He said the city hired the engineering firm of Anderson Perry & Associates Inc. to shoulder that work.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor will be traveling next week to visit National Guard troops stationed in Lithuania and to honor the victims of last year’s Pittsburgh synagogue shooting during a stop at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial. Gov. Tom Wolf’s office announced Tuesday he will spend time with some of the nearly 600 Pennsylvanians stationed with the National Guard in Lithuania and Poland and will meet with Lithuanian government and business leaders. Pennsylvania’s military partnership with Lithuania involves training and collaboration and goes back more than a quarter-century. Wolf’s visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial will be to honor the 11 worshippers shot to death during an attack on the Tree of Life synagogue building in October. The Democratic governor plans to pay his own air travel and lodging costs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A police oversight board is reviewing the constitutionality of how the Providence Police Department added people to a database to identify suspected gang members. The department said in July that it had temporarily stopped operating the database, after the Providence Youth Student Movement filed a lawsuit. WPRI-TV reports the Providence External Review Authority heard testimony from the American Civil Liberties Union Rhode Island chapter last week. The chapter’s executive director, Steven Brown, says people can end up in the database even if they haven’t been involved in any way in criminal activity. Lindsay Lague, a police department spokeswoman, has said police are reviewing their policy. The Providence Youth Student Movement is suing over non-gang members being included, which they say led to discrimination in interactions with police.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMurrells Inlet: A few hundred people in a coastal area will get to vote on which county they live in this November. Gov. Henry McMaster has signed an executive order allowing an unprecedented election for about 200 property owners who thought they lived in Horry County but, as it turns out, are actually in Georgetown County. A review of the boundary by state officials determined it was drawn using natural markers and didn’t take into account tidal changes. That shifted the affected properties into a new county. The homeowners will vote on whether they want to be annexed into Horry County or remain in Georgetown County. To change counties will require a two-thirds vote. A law allowing the referendum passed in May.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: The operator of the only large-scale, active gold mine in the Black Hills will be conducting exploratory drilling. Wharf Resources has notified state regulators it will drill 125 holes near the Richmond Hill Mine in search of gold. The mine was closed 26 years ago because of environmental pollution caused by acid-rock drainage. The company produced nearly 77,000 ounces of gold and more than 50,000 ounces of silver last year at its Wharf Mine near Lead. Sales of the gold and silver generated $96.5 million in 2018. The Rapid City Journal says the remaining life of the Wharf mine is estimated to be seven years.\n\nTennessee\n\nClarksville: The state Transportation Department has announced a $1.82million federal grant for the city’s construction of a pedestrian bridge to complete a 10-mile hiking and biking trail linking the downtown riverfront with the northeastern part of the city. The bridge over the Red River is the final phase of the Red River Trail, which also includes a connection to the Austin Peay State University campus. Clarksville will be responsible for about $675,000 of the total project. It will involve construction of a 290-foot-long, 10-foot-wide bridge that will cross the river at the site of a former railroad bridge. It also includes construction of a 500-foot overhead boardwalk that descends from the bridge to the surface level on the north bank of the river and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott is dismissing calls to hold an emergency legislative session on guns following a violent August that began and ended with mass shootings. The Legislature doesn’t meet again until 2021, which Democrats said Wednesday is too long to wait for new safeguards in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa that killed 29 people. Only the governor can call a special session, and state Democratic lawmakers are trying to ratchet up pressure on Abbott after last weekend’s attack in West Texas that killed seven people and injured about two dozen more. But Abbott, an avid gun rights supporter, has resisted those calls. His spokesman says that the solution isn’t dividing lawmakers on party-line votes and that legislating on tough issues takes time.\n\nUtah\n\nMonticello: Federal officials say rock climbers are now free to enjoy an area near the town where raptors historically have nested. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management had asked climbers in February to voluntarily avoid some walls within the Indian Creek corridor. Wildlife biologists say peregrine falcons, eagles and other birds rely on the area to lay their eggs and raise their young. The BLM had cleared several walls for climbing earlier this year after finding no nests there. It said Tuesday that the entire area is open for fall climbing since two peregrine falcons have left a nest. The agency says Indian Creek draws climbers who want to practice their technique on cracks that split the face of a rock.\n\nVermont\n\nRandolph: The state will recognize the service and commitment of the late National Guard Brig. Gen. Michael Heston with a Memorial Walkway at the veterans’ cemetery in the city. A ceremony to dedicate the walkway is planned for Saturday at the Vermont Veterans Memorial Cemetery. The guard says Heston, a former assistant adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard who died last November at age 58, was instrumental in helping to expand the veterans’ cemetery. The new walkway connects the Circle of Flags, the Global War on Terror Memorial and the new Public Information Center. The ceremony is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As the state’s ginseng harvest season begins, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is reminding residents about regulations aimed at protecting the plant. American ginseng, which grows wild in Virginia’s forests, is listed as a threatened species under the state’s Endangered Plant and Insect Species Act. Ginseng collection is prohibited on most public lands in Virginia. On public lands where ginseng harvesting is allowed, diggers must obtain a permit. On private property, anyone harvesting ginseng must obtain permission from the property owner. Wild ginseng harvest season begins Sept. 1 and ends Dec. 31 of each year. Ginseng younger than 5 years old cannot be harvested. Anyone who harvests wild ginseng must plant the seeds of the harvested plant at the harvest site at the time of the harvest.\n\nWashington\n\nLynnwood: Officials have broken ground on a light-rail project that will eventually take riders from Lynnwood to downtown Seattle in less than half an hour. The Daily Herald reports a ceremonial groundbreaking took place near the future station Tuesday. Service is to start in 2024 and will for the first time link King and Snohomish counties. Lynnwood Link is part of the ST2 plan approved by voters in 2008 and builds on continuing work to extend track from Husky Stadium through the University District to Northgate in Seattle. Four stations will line the 8.5-mile route from Northgate to Lynnwood. The Everett Link extension to Lynnwood is part of the next planned expansion of Sound Transit and as of now is slated to open in 2036.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A grant program that encourages the state’s schools and arts organizations to integrate arts education with science, technology, engineering and math is taking applications for approximately $175,000 in funding. The West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History is accepting applications for STEAM Power WV grants through Oct. 4. The funding is provided through a grant from the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation. An agency statement says grants of up to $7,500 are available for public and private preschool through high school programs, school systems, nonprofit arts organizations and community nonprofits with arts-related missions. The department plans to fund at least 25 new projects taking place between now and June.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Young farmers hoping to make a living as well as those nearing retirement who want to hand off their operations to the next generation would benefit from a package of bills unveiled Tuesday designed to help stem the tide of farm bankruptcies in the state. The three proposals are sponsored by Democrats but have bipartisan support, increasing their chances of being considered by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of Wisconsin farms decreased by more than 7%, more than double the national average of 3.2%, according to the Census of Agriculture. Total farm acreage in Wisconsin also shrank by 2% over that time. Wisconsin’s signature dairy industry has been hit particularly hard. The new bills don’t target dairy farms specifically but are designed to help farmers remain viable when they are just starting out.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Department of Education has issued a security survey to schools to determine how they plan to protect children. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the survey was sent to district superintendents across the state in a weekly email from department Superintendent Jillian Balow. Officials say the 20-question survey covers topics such as training programs, threat assessment tools and means used to secure entrances. Balow says the survey is meant to ensure “a baseline of best practices and support systems” in schools statewide. She says threat plans and related training programs can vary widely between school districts. Balow says she will publicize the survey results later this year. Wyoming lawmakers earlier this year failed to pass a proposed bill to require baseline security protocols for every school district.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/01/milestone-rhino-bigfoot-shooting-jailed-feeding-news-around-states/39874537/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nElmore: A K-9 known as both the best narcotics-sniffing dog in the state and a “knucklehead” was honored at a memorial service Tuesday after he died searching for drugs during a prison sweep. The 5-year-old Belgian Malinois named Jake suddenly became ill July 18 after he came into contact with a powdery synthetic street drug known as flakka during a routine contraband search. He died two days later after developing pneumonia and other complications. Fellow four-legged law enforcement officers yapped in the background at the Staton Kennel Complex in Elmore as Jake received a 21-gun salute, a traditional bugle playing of taps, a commendation from Gov. Kay Ivey and eulogies from law enforcement officials. Officials are still investigating the source of the narcotic at the Staton Correctional Facility.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Repairs and upgrades at earthquake-damaged area schools could cost more than $150 million. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Anchorage School District says the new estimate triples the original assessment of damage caused by the Nov. 30 quake. District officials say two schools need more than $20 million to repair and improve seismic performance; six schools may require at least $10 million; and improvement projects at 14 schools could cost at least $1 million each. District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says the estimates include immediate repairs needed and optional improvements that would improve the quake-readiness of schools. Roth says the district has spent $8 million to $9 million so far on post-quake repairs to return facilities to working condition.\n\nArizona\n\nTusayan: Fees could be going up at a large campground near the Grand Canyon’s popular South Rim entrance. A proposal by the Kaibab National Forest would more than double the overnight fees for single sites from $10 to $24 and at double sites from $20 to $48. The cost for large group sites at Ten X Campground also would go up from $75 per night to $125. Forest officials say the proposed hikes better align with prices at nearby recreation areas. They say additional funding would help maintain and expand the site and also allow them to bring in more seasonal workers. Officials say the campground fees haven’t gone up in more than 25 years. The public has until Oct. 31 to comment on the proposal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials say the four companies providing coverage through the state’s insurance exchange under the federal health care overhaul law are seeking an average rate increase of about 2% for next year. Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday that all four insurers cited the elimination of an exchange user fee in their rate requests. The highest average initial rate-hike request for individual plans came from Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield at 2.89% and the lowest from QualChoice Life and Health at 0.51%. The average increase requested by Ambetter from AR Health & Wellness was 1.9%, and the average from QCA Health Plan was 0.56%. The requests are subject to an independent actuarial analysis under state law, and the Insurance Department has until Sept. 18 to approve rates for next year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A conservation organization says it has achieved the first successful artificial insemination birth of a southern white rhino in North America, an important step in saving another rhino species from extinction. San Diego Zoo Global says mother Victoria gave birth Sunday to a healthy southern white rhino male calf in the barn at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park after 30 minutes of labor. Victoria was artificially inseminated with frozen semen from southern white rhino Maoto following hormone-induced ovulation. Victoria carried her calf for over a year – 493 days. Mother and calf will remain off exhibit to the public for now to allow them to bond. The calf will eventually be introduced to the other five female rhinos at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center – including Amani, also pregnant through artificial insemination and due to give birth this fall.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant, officials said Tuesday. The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills. The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992. Seven groups representing environmentalists, ex-nuclear workers, area residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. Government attorneys are fighting the request. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files but now say the search is ongoing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is seeking scenic Connecticut photos. For the second year, DEEP is holding the Discover Outdoor Connecticut Photo Contest. Photographers from any state may participate, but all submissions must have been taken in Connecticut. Photographers may enter one photo in each of three categories: wildlife; people enjoying the natural world; and scenic landscapes and flora. Judges will select first-, second- and third-place winners in each category. There’s a separate youth category. Entries must be postmarked by Aug. 16. Entry forms can be found on DEEP’s website. First-place winners will have their photograph published in DEEP’s Connecticut Wildlife magazine. Winners will also receive gift cards.\n\nDelaware\n\nBowers: The Murderkill River has claimed a nearby bait shop that stood as an icon to the surrounding town’s history as a commercial fishing hotspot. News outlets report Frenchie’s Bait & Tackle partially slid into the river late Monday. The shop’s front end still sits on the shores of Bower Beach, where it was rebuilt after it burned down in the 1990s. Owner and commercial fisherman William “Frenchie” Poulin says it appears the shop’s eroded pilings gave out. The Bowers Beach Maritime Museum says responding authorities turned off the shop’s power and worked to contain any hazardous materials, such as oil. It says a cat that lived at the shop is now homeless. Councilman Bob McDevitt says no one was injured. Poulin previously served as Bower’s mayor and as a councilman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is asking Maryland to release over $50 million the state has withheld for a month amid ongoing funding disputes. The Washington Post reports Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld recently sent a letter to Maryland officials requesting funds be released immediately, warning Metro’s credit rating could take a hit. Maryland was supposed to release $56 million July 1, which was set to go toward new trains and buses. But Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn says Metro has delayed audits and hasn’t provided adequate information about its spending. The newspaper says the dispute may relate to Gov. Larry Hogan’s view that Maryland spends too much on transit rather than roads.\n\nFlorida\n\nRedington Beach: Authorities and beachgoers came together to protect and transport five pilot whales trapped in shallow water along the state’s western shore. News outlets report the whales were first spotted Monday morning, and biologists and beachgoers swung into action, covering the whales from the climbing sun as the tide pulled away from shore. Biologists determined the whales were healthy enough for transport, and volunteers teamed up to move the heavy creatures. Three whales were returned to the sea, while two others were taken to a Clearwater Marine Aquarium facility in Tarpon Springs for medical treatment and testing. Aquarium spokeswoman Carlee Wendell says pilot whale mass strandings have happened about a dozen times since 1990. Just this month, dozens of disoriented pilot whales were saved from a mass stranding near a Georgia shore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia’s seaports are celebrating another year of record growth, though their chief executive warns business will suffer if the U.S. doesn’t resolve its trade war with China. The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that its ports at Savannah and Brunswick handled a record 37.5 million tons of cargo in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s a 4.2% increase over the previous year. A whopping 4.5 million container units of imports and exports were shipped through Savannah. Griff Lynch, the port authority’s executive director, said he’s concerned tariffs imposed in the Trump administration’s trade dispute with China, if unresolved, could slow business in the coming year. Lynch said export volumes dipped slightly in June, and “that could very well be linked to the tariffs.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor on Tuesday rescinded an emergency proclamation put in place to deal with Native Hawaiian protesters who are blocking a road to prevent the construction of a giant telescope at a mountain summit they consider sacred. Gov. David Ige said there were no immediate plans to move heavy equipment to Mauna Kea’s summit. He also noted two hurricanes were approaching that could affect the protest area and the rest of the state. Hurricane Erick is forecast to pass south of the Big Island this week. Following right after is Hurricane Flossie, on track to come close to the islands early next week. “For the safety of all involved, we want to deescalate activities,” Ige said. He declared an emergency July 17 to give law enforcement more authority to close areas of the mountain and to use additional National Guard troops to help deliver construction gear.\n\nIdaho\n\nJerome: The University of Idaho has bought land for a public visitor center, classrooms and other facilities supporting what officials say will be the world’s largest research dairy. Bill Loftus with the university’s College of Ag and Life Sciences told The Times-News the new property near Jerome represents a significant step for the planned Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Work on the CAFE began over a decade ago, and the university plans to have the dairy up and running in 2024. The project spans three sites: a food processing research and training facility at the College of Southern Idaho; the dairy, which will hold 2,000 head of cattle; and the Discovery Complex, which will be built at the newest property and include classrooms, the visitor center, faculty offices and housing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s transportation agencies are boosting services to accommodate tens of thousands of people attending Lollapalooza. The Metra commuter train and the CTA subway agencies will expand capacity for one of the nation’s most popular music festivals, which takes place from Thursday through Sunday in Chicago’s Grant Park. The lineup at Lollapalooza this year includes Ariana Grande, Lil Wayne, The Strokes and more than 150 other performers. Over 100,000 people are expected to attend each day. Metra will add trains and adjust schedules on most lines for the four-day event. CTA will add service on rail lines and bus routes. In a statement Friday, CTA President Dorval R. Carter Jr. said there will be ample service to get attendees to the festival “easily and comfortably.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The body of notorious 1930s gangster John Dillinger is expected to be exhumed in September at a local cemetery, but it could be a tough job because his grave is encased in concrete. Digging up the remains more than 85 years after Dillinger was killed by FBI agents also could resolve conspiracy theories that the man some considered a hero during the Great Depression isn’t buried in his marked grave, said Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society. Among the tales is that his family tricked the FBI into shooting the wrong man. The Indiana State Department of Health approved a permit sought by Dillinger’s nephew to have the body exhumed from Crown Hill Cemetery and reinterred there. Days after his son’s funeral, Dillinger’s father had the casket reburied under a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs, Sutton said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The ousted director of the state Department of Human Services will pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit, alleging he was let go after objecting to a pay arrangement for the governor’s deputy chief of staff, his lawyer said Wednesday. Jerry Foxhoven will file a whistleblower claim with the State Appeal Board, the first step toward pursuing a lawsuit against state government, his attorney Tom Duff said. It’s the latest development stemming from a personnel decision that has put Gov. Kim Reynolds on the defensive and prompted inquiries by state and federal watchdogs. Earlier this month, Reynolds’ spokesman wouldn’t confirm or deny whether Foxhoven’s workplace praise for rapper Tupac Shakur played a role in his being asked to resign, but the governor later said that she’d never heard of the rap icon and that “of course” that wasn’t the reason.\n\nKansas\n\nWellington: The National Glass Museum is temporarily closed after the front of the building collapsed. The front of the museum and most of the front brick facade collapsed overnight Friday. KAKE-TV reports the collapse is blamed on heavy rains during the year. The landlord hopes to rebuild and reopen the museum by the end of September. Pam Meyer, president of the National Depress Glass Association, said the building had been leaning for some time. She said the group plans to stay in Wellington. The museum displays American-made glassware from the Great Depression era. None of the museum pieces were damaged.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Federal officials are investigating a report that a man fired a gunshot while camping at Mammoth Cave National Park, an incident that another camper says was prompted by an alleged sighting of Bigfoot. Mammoth Cave said law enforcement rangers responded early Sunday to a report of a person with a firearm at one of the park’s backcountry campsites. Brad Ginn told news outlets he and his girlfriend were camping nearby and were awakened about 1 a.m. by a man with his son. The man said they were going to investigate strange noises he kept hearing. Ginn said he heard a gunshot minutes later, and the man returned to say Bigfoot had emerged from the woods, so he fired. Ginn said he and his girlfriend decided to leave and report the incident. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer said an investigation continues, and the park is safe to visit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 260 new laws are taking effect in the state as August begins. Starting Thursday, people must be at least 16 years old to marry. Medical marijuana patients can inhale cannabis. Women seeking abortions via medication are limited to Louisiana’s three abortion clinics, rather than a doctor’s office. Parents who scuffle with referees at children’s sport events face new penalties. Animal shelters can’t take in stray or unwanted animals solely to euthanize them for research facilities or sell animals for research or experimentation. Louisiana agencies can’t deny or revoke an occupational license when someone falls behind on student loan repayments. Anti-hazing laws get tougher, with new provisions aimed at forcing colleges to report allegations more quickly.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: The Maine Lobster Festival is underway, with festivalgoers planning to eat hundreds of the state’s beloved arthropods and crown a new sea goddess. The decades-old festival takes place near the Rockland waterfront and offers fare including steamed lobster, lobster bisque, lobster mac and cheese, lobster rolls, lobster wraps and lobster Caesar salad. The festival started Wednesday and ends Sunday. Wednesday’s big event is the 72nd Maine Sea Goddess Coronation. That piece of the festival caused a stir in the community last year when the winner lost her crown a day after her coronation over social media posts showing her holding a marijuana cigarette. New leaders of the festival later apologized to the pageant winner, Taylor Hamlin.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Officials in the city are creating unique learning spaces to help students traumatized by violence and poverty. Trauma-sensitive schools offer mental-health clinicians, mindfulness exercises, and abundant “peace corners” with pillows and books where students can retreat and compose themselves. The schools come in response to a growing realization among educators that chronic childhood trauma affects brain development and creates the risk of health problems. The need to address childhood trauma and mental health was underscored in Baltimore in 2015. The death of young black man Freddie Gray in police custody brought renewed attention to poverty, inequity and crime in large swaths of Baltimore. And the city drew national attention when President Donald Trump tweeted that its congressional district is a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An archaeological dig in historic Chinatown has been cut short after it turned up a 1980s music cassette, a toy dinosaur and other bric-a-brac. The city’s Archaeology Program tweeted Tuesday that it was wrapping up its three-week excavation because researchers reached the water table, and it was unsafe to dig further. The excavation of a vacant lot near the neighborhood’s distinctive gateway had been expected to last until early autumn. In recent days, researchers have been humorously tweeting some of their “finds,” including a cassette by Boston R&B group New Edition, a dinosaur toy, linoleum flooring, and other items from the 1970s and 1980s. Researchers had hoped to turn up artifacts shedding new light on Boston’s immigrants from China, Syria, Ireland and England who sought new lives in Chinatown from 1840 to 1980.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A mission to return the Arctic grayling to state waters is nearing a milestone. Juvenile grayling are scheduled to arrive soon at the Oden State Fish Hatchery in Emmet County, where an ultraviolet water disinfection system recently was installed. Fish production manager Ed Eisch of the Department of Natural Resources says the system will prevent fish already in the area from being infected by viruses or bacteria that the newly arrived grayling might bring along. They were collected as eggs in Alaska and have been kept at Michigan State University. The juvenile fish will be reared in isolation at Oden. Once cleared by health testing, they’ll be transferred to Marquette State Fish Hatchery to continue maturing. Grayling are native to Michigan but died out because of logging and overfishing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: About 200 people protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies blocked traffic near a Twin Cities federal building at Fort Snelling on Tuesday. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building houses an immigration court sometimes referred to as “deportation court.” Demonstrators blocked traffic late Tuesday afternoon in protest of ICE policies at the Mexican border, the separation of families and conditions in immigrant detention centers. Police cited about 25 protesters. Some held signs that read “Close the Camps” and “Abolish Ice.” The protest was part of a national movement called #NeverAgainIsNow, which links the Holocaust to America’s treatment of migrants arriving from Central America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Wildlife Federation’s Mississippi Wildlife Extravaganza has long been considered the unofficial start of hunting season in the state and draws tens of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts, but this year may prove different. Sportsmen say they’ll boycott the event this weekend, and vendors are dropping out over the organization’s stance on floodwater pumps in the south Delta. Flooding there most of the year has led to damaged homes, loss of crops, business closings and wildlife deaths. At its peak, floodwater covered a reported 550,000 acres of prime farmland and wildlife habitat. Proponents of the pumps say much of the flooding could have been avoided if pumps were installed at the Steele Bayou Control structure to push backwater out. But MWF has publicly opposed the pumps over environmental damage concerns.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A spokesman for the University of Missouri’s flagship campus says the school has identified fewer than 10 students whose parents may have taken advantage of a financial aid loophole. At issue is a practice of wealthy parents transferring guardianship of their children to friends or relatives to make it appear they came from poorer backgrounds, making them eligible for more financial aid. The U.S. Education Department is being urged to make changes to close the loophole. University of Missouri spokesman Christian Basi says the school will pull the funding it provides based on need and notify federal authorities if the determination is made that guardianship changes were done solely to take advantage of financial aid. Basi says no one will be kicked out of school, but the university is “extremely disappointed.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The blood supplier of area hospitals says it needs more donors after its daily blood donation count has fallen by more than half. The Billings Gazette reports Vitalant of Montana aims to get between 150 and 200 units of blood each day, but the daily donation has dropped to about 70 units. St. Vincent Healthcare and the Billings Clinic said in a joint statement that the blood supply is “alarmingly low,” so they need more people to donate regularly. Vitalant donor recruitment manager Erin Baker says the supplier has had trouble attracting donors who are ages 24-40. Most of the donors are 50 and older. Baker says a person would ideally donate blood at least three times a year.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state trooper has cited a driver after pulling over a vehicle that had registration stickers painted onto its license plates. Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas says the vehicle was stopped Monday morning at an Interstate 80 exit in north Lincoln. Trooper Adam Strode spotted the problem, and he ticketed the driver for having fictitious plates and not having valid registration. It’s unclear whether the driver also was the artist whose unsteady hand fashioned two rough red rectangles in the upper right-hand corner of the plates. The number 5 was in the middle, signifying a May expiration for 2020. Thomas says troopers to whom he’s talked told him it was the first time they’d heard of or “seen anything like this.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airport officials say a 3.1% jump in the number of passengers for the first half of 2019 puts McCarran International Airport on record pace to top 50 million passengers for the year. The Clark County Department of Aviation reports the 4.5 million arriving and departing travelers at the airport in June followed an all-time-high monthly tally of 4.6 million passengers in May. The airport handled a record-high 49.7 million passengers in 2018. McCarran is one of the 10 busiest airports in the nation based on passenger count. Domestic airlines have handled more than 22.8 million McCarran passengers through June, up 2.9% from the first half of 2018. Southwest Airlines is the busiest carrier at the airport, followed by Delta, Spirit, American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: An annual gathering of current and former foster youth has a rap music theme this year. Participants at Thursday’s Youth Voices Summit at New England College in Henniker will attend workshops on topics such as getting a college degree; finding a job; choosing a career; budgeting; self-advocacy; forming healthy relationships; and finding help for substance abuse. This year’s keynote speaker is Ethan Birch, also known as rapper Six 8. He’s been a vocal youth advocate at several national events, including the Future Business Leaders of America State Convention. In addition to providing the keynote address, Ethan will lead an afternoon workshop on positive rap. The event will also include a listening session led by the Office of the Child Advocate and a youth talent show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: The state’s senior U.S. senator wants federal officials to take more aggressive action to protect beachgoers from wind-swept beach umbrellas. Bob Menendez held a news conference to once again call on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to improve its regulations and develop an aggressive campaign to educate beachgoers on the dangers the umbrellas can pose if they’re not properly staked in the sand. But the Democrat stressed that he wasn’t calling for a ban on umbrellas. A woman was speared in the leg by a beach umbrella last summer in the Jersey Shore community of Seaside Heights. CPSC statistics show that more than 31,000 people were treated at hospitals for umbrella-related injuries from 2008-2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The mother of a Navajo girl who was kidnapped and killed in 2016 urged tribal officials and children’s advocates Tuesday to take advantage of tools and funding under a law that expands access to the nation’s Amber Alert system. Pamela Foster spoke during a training at Isleta Pueblo, south of Albuquerque, for tribes seeking to implement the alert system. Despite a 2007 pilot project, it was not in place on the Navajo Nation when her daughter Ashlynne Mike was abducted near Shiprock. Her disappearance was a catalyst for the state to fully implement Amber Alerts. “I want you to know there was nothing worse than finding out there were no Amber Alert systems on the reservation at the time when we needed it most. No roadway digital signs, no text alerts,” Foster said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State ethics officials are threatening to fine a woman up to $75,000 for unregistered lobbying after she rented billboards to criticize state laws on molestation and share her own story of abuse. Kat Sullivan, a nurse who says she was assaulted by a teacher at a private school upstate two decades ago, was part of the successful push that got lawmakers in Albany to relax the statute of limitations on molestation. Sullivan got the billboard idea from the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a woman who used billboards to seek justice for her daughter’s unsolved murder. Sullivan also set up a website and hired a pilot to fly a plane around Albany carrying a banner supporting the legislation. Then she received a letter saying she could be fined for violating a law requiring individuals to register as lobbyists if they spend more than $5,000 on efforts to influence the Legislature.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: Officials are looking for an emu on the loose that was last spotted jumping on the hood of a car before running away. News outlets report that officials say the emu, nicknamed “Eno,” was sighted over the weekend. Orange County Animal Services spokesperson Tenille Fox says it’s believed to be in the Hillsborough area. An Orange County government Twitter account posted an emu’s mugshot Friday with the word “wanted” in red letters. Officials say it’s been on the run for about five weeks. They don’t know where the flightless bird escaped from. Fox says people shouldn’t try to catch it but instead should call animal services. Fox says owning emus is legal in Orange County. She says they’re often kept on farms and don’t usually run away.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landowners group has sued the state over a new law related to compensation for the use of cavities in underground rock formations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the Northwest Landowners Association filed its lawsuit Monday challenging the law that takes effect Thursday. The group says the new law amounts to the unconstitutional taking of private property rights. Gov. Doug Burgum in April signed the legislation that sought to clarify issues surrounding the cavities known as “pore space,” which may be used to inject saltwater from oil and gas production or for enhanced oil recovery. Under the new law, some landowners cannot be compensated for their pore space. Burgum has said the law clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry.\n\nOhio\n\nGarfield Heights: A judge wants to take a second look at a 10-day jail sentence given to a 79-year-old woman for refusing to stop feeding stray cats in her suburban Cleveland neighborhood. Cleveland.com reports that Garfield Heights Municipal Court Judge Jennifer Weiler wants to hear the case herself after a jail sentence handed down to Nancy Segula by a city magistrate last week was widely criticized. Segula acknowledges repeatedly violating a city ordinance making it illegal for people to feed dogs and cats that aren’t their own. She was sentenced to jail after her fourth appearance in court for the violations. She says she lost her husband and her own cats in 2017, and she began feeding the cats because she’s lonely.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWelch: Authorities are starting a new search for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for nearly 20 years. Craig County District Attorney’s spokeswoman Michelle Lowry says the search for Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible is being held near the Picher area, where authorities have said the girls’ bodies are believed to have been dumped. The girls disappeared Dec. 30, 1999, from Freeman’s home in nearby Welch. Freeman’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found fatally shot in the burned home. In April 2018, authorities charged 68-year-old Ronnie Dean Busick with four counts of first-degree murder in the case and said two other suspects are dead. Busick has denied involvement in the case and is undergoing a mental competency evaluation.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A real estate investor has donated undeveloped land to Portland Audubon’s Wildlife Sanctuary. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Marty Kehoe and his family have donated Pittock Place. The 22-acre plot borders Forest Park, a public park west of downtown. Audubon officials say the property is one of the largest, most ecologically valuable parcels on the periphery of the park. The land is worth an estimated $14 million and was slated for development of 32 multimillion-dollar homes. Officials say donors raised $200,000 to pay the property’s remaining mortgage, which was Kehoe’s only stipulation. The City of Portland contributed $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement. The city is also expected to provide $150,000 for restoration services including invasive plant removal and water quality protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvanians who prefer not to be identified as male or female will soon have a gender-neutral option on their state-issued driver’s licenses. The state joins more than 10 others that have rolled out plans to give residents options. The Daily Item of Sunbury reports Pennsylvania Department of Transportation expects to have the new procedure in place by the middle of next year. It will let motorists use “X” as a third option to indicate gender. A department spokeswoman says the agency is able to make the change on its own and doesn’t need authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday that the department made the decision, but it’s consistent with his opinions about equity and fairness.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Providence Teachers Union has declared its commitment to work with the state to reform the city’s schools. The report from the union came less than a week after state Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green was given sweeping authority to turn around Providence Public Schools. The union’s document details several reform recommendations, including addressing chronic teacher absenteeism, increasing the number of educators of color and integrating community members into everyday work at schools. Infante-Green responded to the union in a statement saying she welcomes the commitment from teachers. The Department of Education sought control of Providence schools after a searing report last month from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy labeled it among the worst public school systems in the nation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: The state Department of Education has been granted $8million to buy new school buses thanks to a settlement involving Volkswagen. State leaders including Gov. Henry McMaster made the announcement Tuesday in Lexington. The money will be used to buy 78 school buses that run on propane. The state has been criticized as having one of the worst school bus fleets in the country. Lawmakers set aside $19 million from lottery profits this year for school buses. Charleston’s transit system received money for two electric buses and charging stations. Anderson received money for a bus fueled by compressed natural gas. South Carolina will receive nearly $34 million from the 2016 emissions settlement the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached with Volkswagen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union is creating a new position in the state focusing on indigenous issues. ACLU director of campaigns Sabrina King says the position will be modeled on the organization’s indigenous justice program in Montana. King will supervise the new South Dakota position. The ACLU has long wanted to build on its work on indigenous issues in the state. The idea took on new urgency after South Dakota this year passed laws aimed at potential Keystone XL protests. The laws allow for tougher penalties for so-called riot boosting, defined in part as encouraging violence during a riot. The ACLU is challenging the law in federal court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is providing access to federal grant programs to help communities and volunteer fire departments become better equipped for wildfires. The state Department of Agriculture will accept applications for Hazard Mitigation Assistance program grants from Aug. 5 through Sept. 20. Eligible communities must have crafted or be in the process of crafting a Community Wildfire Prevention Plan. The grants offer full reimbursement up to $20,000 for communities to implement wildfire prevention efforts and education projects. A program to help fire departments serving 10,000 or fewer people will open Aug. 5 and end Sept. 13. The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program offers 50% reimbursement for wildland fire equipment and supplies from $1,000 to $6,000.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Officials have approved a settlement in a federal lawsuit over the bail system in Harris County that ensures that most people accused of misdemeanor offenses don’t languish in jail. The bail system in the state’s most populous county had been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge following a 2016 lawsuit alleging poor misdemeanor defendants remained jailed because of their poverty. Harris County commissioners approved the settlement by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, with the two Republicans on the court voting against it. The settlement ensures most people charged with misdemeanor offenses would be released within hours of arrest and would get help to ensure they attend future court appearances. The judge handling the lawsuit could give final approval at an Aug. 21 court hearing.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s decision to award a smaller number of medical marijuana grower licenses than allowed by law is being challenged by six companies that say the state granted licenses to unqualified cultivators and had inappropriate interactions with applicants, among other claims. Chris Hughes, director of the state’s Division of Purchasing, confirmed that six rejected applicants met Friday’s appeal deadline. The administrative appeal could further delay the rollout of medical marijuana for the state because state law says licenses cannot be finalized until protests are resolved. Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food selected eight companies to grow medical marijuana for its program set to open next year. Although the new law allows Utah to award up to 10 licenses at the start of the program, state officials say they chose to only hand out eight to avoid an oversupply of cannabis.\n\nVermont\n\nCastleton: Castleton University has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Learning for the newest extension of its nursing program. The school took over the registered nurse bachelor’s degree program previously offered by Southern Vermont College in Bennington, which closed after the spring semester. The Rutland Herald reports the new program will be in the Vermont Mill Building in Bennington. It used to be home to the radiology and X-ray programs and is being renovated before the fall semester. More than 30 students are enrolled; 25 are from Southern Vermont College. School officials say the nursing shortage is ongoing, and 3,800 nursing positions will be vacant in the next five years. Castleton nursing educators say there’s a plan in the works for a potential master’s program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A video rental store that is believed to be among the last of its size on the East Coast is set to close this month. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Naro Expanded Video Archival Library in Norfolk will close by the end of August. The store has more than 42,000 video titles and outlasted a vast number of video rental businesses that have already closed across the country. But like them, it fell victim to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Naro Video converted from a business to a nonprofit in 2016 and partially relied on fundraisers. One raised $45,000 from 440 people in less than two days. That likely kept it going for another two years. But such efforts couldn’t provide sustainability over the long term.\n\nWashington\n\nSeatac: Democrats have elected the first female speaker of the state House. With the selection of state Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma, Washington becomes the eighth state to have a woman in the top spot in the House and is now the second state to have a gay speaker of the House, joining Oregon. “I’m really proud to be the first woman, the first out lesbian serving in this position,” Jenkins said at a news conference after the vote. “I believe very, very strongly that the diversity of our caucus really more and more is representing the diversity of our state and helps us make better decisions for the people of this state. I’m proud to be a part of carrying that forward.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: People recovering from substance abuse disorder can get rides to appointments under a forthcoming project in the area. The Herald-Dispatch reports the Appalachian Regional Commission has provided more than $215,000 for the one-year pilot program. ARC federal co-chair Tim Thomas says it will start in October in the Huntington region. Thomas says those recovering from substance abuse disorder often do not have an active driver’s license or own a vehicle. Rides will be given for recovery and treatment appointments, probation meetings, mandatory court appearances, job interviews or to a new job. Other program sponsors include the Appalachian Transportation Institute, the state Department of Health and Human Resources, the Office of Drug Control Policy and the West Virginia Governor’s Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is pushing to toughen state rules to reduce nitrate contamination in ground and surface water as concerns grow about pollution across the state. Evers announced Wednesday that he is directing the state Department of Natural Resources to establish nitrate performance standards for soil most likely to be contaminated. Environmental group Clean Wisconsin praised the news, saying creating new rules for how nitrates are applied to farm fields is an important step for protecting rural drinking water across the state. Evers is directing state agencies to start the process of creating a rule that will govern the level of nitrates that will be allowable. Studies have shown that agricultural sources such as manure and commercial fertilizer are the most common sources of nitrate pollution.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne Frontier Days officials report a slight increase in attendance at night shows this year, while rodeo attendance saw a slight drop. The annual western and rodeo event ended Sunday. KGAB-AM reports that officials say in a news release that overall attendance increased slightly this year compared to 2018. Total night show attendance this year was 120,518, compared to 115,214 last year. Rodeo attendance this year was pegged at 97,373 in 2019 compared to an official attendance of 101,462 in 2018. The official attendance for the three 2019 CFD pancake breakfasts was pegged at 22,713, while 50,998 visited the Indian Village.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/14/malcolm-country-benefit-show-rising-tide-news-around-states/50734257/", "title": "Malcolm X, country benefit show: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge that it could soon be ready to use a new, untried execution method called nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/21/slavery-reckonings-radio-citys-return-marijuana-movements-news-around-states/117129826/", "title": "Slavery reckonings, Radio City's return: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the white Alabama businessman who financed the voyage of the last slave ship to land in the United States more than 160 years ago have agreed to sell a building that will become a hub for Africatown USA, the community settled by the freed Africans after the Civil War. A long-closed credit union building owned by relatives of Timothy Meaher will open within weeks as a food bank and as home of the Africatown Redevelopment Corp., officials told a news conference Thursday. The family sold the brick building to the city for $50,000, well below its appraised value of $300,000. The family, which tax records show owns millions of dollars’ worth of land around Mobile, issued a statement that described selling the building as a way “to give back to the community.” Mayor Sandy Stimpson said he contacted a representative of the family about acquiring the property in Africatown, located just a few miles north of downtown Mobile. Large parts of the once-vibrant community are blighted, but the area has received new attention since the wreckage of the slave ship, Clotilda, was found in 2018. Community leaders are now trying to revitalize the area with a museum and other attractions that could bring visitors and an infusion of money into the area.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A special legislative session limped toward a bitter end Friday, with the threat of a partial government shutdown looming and Gov. Mike Dunleavy and House majority leaders sharply disagreeing over the adequacy of the budget passed by lawmakers last week. Dunleavy called the budget “defective,” pointing in particular to the House’s failure to get the two-thirds support for a procedural effective-date vote. His office said notices were sent to thousands of state workers warning of possible layoffs with the new fiscal year beginning July 1. He called another special session, set to begin Wednesday and again focus on the budget, shortly after the House held a brief floor session for which attendance was not mandatory Friday afternoon. House majority leaders were among those who criticized Dunleavy’s stance on the budget. House Speaker Louise Stutes characterized it as a needless choice and said Dunleavy has tools available to prevent shutting down parts of the government, including asking minority Republicans to change their votes to support the effective-date clause. Minority Republicans, who say they have felt marginalized and want to be included in talks on what pieces should be considered as part of a broader fiscal plan, take responsibility for their votes, House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Researchers at the University of Arizona will be launching a study of how prone Hispanic children are to asthma in Tucson compared with their peers on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Sonora. The study will follow 500 pregnant women of Mexican descent in both cities and their newborns for the next five years to see how prevalent asthma is. Dr. Fernando Martinez, a principal investigator of the project and director of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, said there is four times less asthma in Nogales, Sonora, than in Tucson, which is about an hour’s drive away. A study of teenagers in Nogales, Arizona, showed 16% had asthma compared with 4% to 6% of teens in the same age range just across the border in Nogales, Sonora. Mexicans who come to the United States also have less asthma than Mexican Americans, researchers have found. The Arizona Daily Star reports the University of Arizona study will look into how the risk of asthma is affected by the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that a child’s reduced exposure to germs stunts the immune system’s ability to fight infectious organisms. The study was delayed due to COVID-19, but researchers plan to begin enrolling pregnant women in August and finish by August 2023.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge Friday refused to allow a man arrested after he was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot to travel for a classic-car swap meet. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper rejected the request by Richard Barnett to loosen the 50-mile restriction on how far he can travel from his residence while he’s on home detention awaiting trial. Barnett’s attorney said the Gravette, Arkansas, man needed to be able to travel to make a living buying and selling classic cars. Petit Jean Mountain, where the car show was being held over the weekend, is 200 miles from Gravette. “The Court is not persuaded that the defendant cannot pursue gainful employment within a 50-mile radius of his home as permitted by the current conditions,” Cooper’s order said. Barnett, 61, was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol as lawmakers assembled to certify Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Prosecutors say Barnett was carrying a stun gun when he entered the building. Federal prosecutors opposed Barnett’s request and said his conduct while awaiting trial – including an interview with Russian State Television – indicated more conditions, not fewer, were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Attorney General Rob Bonta launched new anti-human trafficking teams to apprehend perpetrators and support survivors Friday amid an alarming increase in labor and sexual exploitation statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic. California’s lockdown exacerbated problems with human trafficking, officials said Friday, and made it much harder for victims to escape and find housing and other services. Kay Buck, the chief executive officer for Los Angeles-based nonprofit Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, called it “the most unforgettable and heart-wrenching year” as advocates saw a huge demand in services combined with a shortage of resources. In LA alone, the nonprofit saw a spike of 185% in urgent human trafficking cases during the pandemic, Buck said. Advocates in LA County see victims – many who come from Mexico and the Philippines – who were duped into thinking they would have a job in the U.S. but are instead sold into “modern-day slavery.” Actors and activists Mira Sorvino and Alyssa Milano; state Assemblyman Miguel Santiago; and Angela Guanzon, who escaped her trafficker and aided law enforcement in their prosecution, joined Bonta on Friday to implore Newsom and lawmakers to approve another $30 million in new grants over the next three years, doubling the funding level for the efforts.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited a mobile vaccine clinic near the city Friday to promote COVID-19 shots among underserved communities of color that have some of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. He also met with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, getting briefly interrupted by the governor’s dog, Gia, and another dog dashing through their closed-door session, giving the two a laugh. They discussed the state’s pandemic response and a new law creating a state-administered health insurance plan designed to reduce premiums and costs of care as well as get more people covered. Later, Becerra, the agency’s first Latino leader, and Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation toured a mobile vaccine clinic focused on underserved communities in the Denver suburb of Aurora, which is nearly 30% Hispanic. It’s one of nine mobile units made from converted buses. While Hispanic people make up 20% of Colorado’s population, less than 10% have been vaccinated, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow said many minorities and immigrants have trouble finding the time to get vaccinated while working multiple jobs, highlighting the need for the mobile resources. “Where you are, we will go. Donde tú estás, iremos nosotros,” Becerra said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has become the first in the nation to make all prison phone calls free, addressing one of the biggest emotional and financial burdens faced by incarcerated men and women and their families as they try to stay in touch. The state has a prison contract with phone vendor Securus Technologies, which charges up to $5 for a 15-minute call – some of the highest phone rates in the country. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill into law Wednesday that allows incarcerated men, women and juveniles a minimum of 90 minutes a day of free calls. Supports said the change could go into effect as early as next month. “We’re on the right side of history,” said Democratic state Rep. Josh Elliott, one of the legislation’s supporters. “Corporations can no longer be allowed to exploit the love between incarcerated people and their families – not in our state, not on our watch.” Several more local jurisdictions in the U.S. have also taken steps to make prison and jail phone calls free, including New York City, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. “This historic legislation will change lives,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which has been working with local advocates to slash prison phone costs. “It will keep food on the table for struggling families, children in contact with their parents, and our communities safer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden announced Saturday that Champ, the older of the family’s two dogs, had died “peacefully at home.” The German shepherd was 13. “He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family,” Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement posted to the president’s official Twitter account. The Bidens, who were spending the weekend at their home in Wilmington, got Champ from a breeder after Joe Biden was elected vice president in 2008. Champ was a fixture both at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory and at the White House. In their statement, the Bidens said when Champ was young, “he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory,” and more recently he enjoyed “joining us as a comforting presence in meetings or sunning himself in the White House garden.” “In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion,” the Bidens said. Champ’s passing leaves the Bidens with their younger German shepherd, Major, whom the family adopted from the Delaware Humane Society in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents getting their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at select sites through the end of July will receive $51 gift cards and be entered for a chance to win free flights and other incentives, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Washington has reached 70% of adults having received at least one dose. While anyone can get a COVID-19 shot at district vaccination sites, the gift cards are only available to D.C. residents. Those between the ages of 12 and 17 must be accompanied by a guardian. Residents will receive the gift card after getting their shot. Additionally, Washingtonians getting their shots at Anacostia High School, Ron Brown High School or RISE Demonstration Center will be entered to win two round-trip American Airlines tickets to anywhere the airline flies, including international locations. Other prizes offered in a series of drawings starting Saturday include a new car, a year’s worth of groceries, and a one-year Metro pass. More information about the giveaways can be found at coronavirus.dc.gov/incentives. A full schedule of the days and hours of the current walk-up sites can be found at taketheshotdc.com.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A federal judge on Friday ruled for the state in a lawsuit challenging a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order making it difficult for cruise ships to resume sailing due to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday wrote in a 124-page decision that Florida would be harmed if the CDC order, which the state said effectively blocked most cruises, were to continue. The Tampa-based judge granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the CDC from enforcing the order pending further legal action on a broader lawsuit. “This order finds that Florida is highly likely to prevail on the merits of the claim that CDC’s conditional sailing order and the implementing orders exceed the authority delegated to the CDC,” Merryday wrote. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody praised the decision in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a victory for the hardworking Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the cruise industry,” said Moody, a Republican. “The federal government does not, nor should it ever, have the authority to single out and lock down an entire industry indefinitely.” While the CDC could appeal, Merryday ordered both sides to return to mediation to attempt to work out a full solution – a previous attempt failed – and said the CDC could fashion a modification in which it would retain some public health authority.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia’s secretary of state is making public a list of nearly 102,000 voters who will be removed from the rolls unless they act to preserve their registration. Republican Brad Raffensperger announced the list Friday, part of an every-other-year bid to remove voters who may have died or moved away. The state has about 7.8 million voters, and his office said the removals include about 67,000 voters who submitted a change-of-address form to the U.S. Postal Service, plus about 34,000 voters who had election mail returned. Voter purges in Georgia became a hot-button issue during the 2018 governor’s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. As secretary of state before being elected governor, Kemp oversaw aggressive voter purges during his tenure. More than 1.4 million voter registrations were canceled in Georgia between 2012 and 2018. In the current purge, election officials said, cancellation notices will be mailed, and those who respond within 40 days will have their registration switched back to active. Anyone who is removed could register again. On a monthly basis, the secretary of state been removing voters who were convicted of felonies or who died.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton is condemning the Honolulu Police Department for the fatal shooting of a Black man as various versions of what led to the death continue to emerge. “Lindani Myeni’s killing is yet another sensational racialization and criminalization of an innocent, unarmed black man at the hands of police not following the law and proper police procedures,” Sharpton said in a statement Thursday. Interim Honolulu Police Chief Rade Vanic said the police department is committed to public service, and these “are challenging times for police departments everywhere.” Sharpton weighed in on the April 14 shooting of Myeni after lawyers representing his widow in a wrongful-death lawsuit made public last week a doorbell video showing the 29-year-old arriving at a house, taking off his shoes and quickly leaving after his presence confused the occupants. Myeni repeatedly apologized to the couple. The lawsuit said he likely mistook the home for a temple next door that’s open to the public. Police responding to a 911 call shot him a short time later outside the house, with body camera footage showing an officer fired several gunshots before saying, “Police!” An attorney representing the homeowner and the tourists who were staying in the house said Myeni’s presence wasn’t as innocuous as lawyers for his wife portrayed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is suing Gov. Brad Little and state wildlife officials in federal court, contending Idaho has wrongly denied the tribe hunting rights guaranteed by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Bridger. The lawsuit, filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court last week, asks a judge to declare that the Northwestern Band is protected under the treaty. On its surface, the legal case could come down to whether one of the Native American leaders who signed the treaty was representing the Northwestern Band along with other bands of the Shoshone Nation and whether the Northwestern Band itself has remained a cohesive unit in the time since. But at the heart of the dispute is a dilemma faced by many Native American governments across the U.S. who sometimes find themselves at odds with game wardens, mining companies, water users or other groups as they try to preserve their use of the land they were promised in treaties signed centuries ago. Some Northwestern Band tribal members have faced criminal convictions after Idaho game wardens said they were hunting without tags. In 1997, two brothers were found guilty for hunting out of season in Idaho, though they had hunting tags issued by the Northwestern Band. Shane and Wayde Warner appealed their convictions, claiming rights under the Fort Bridger treaty.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is dangling millions of dollars in cash prizes and scholarships to encourage residents to get vaccinated, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday. Illinois will offer $7 million in cash prizes and $3 million in scholarships through a new lottery open to all residents who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Pritzker made the announcement at a community health center in Chicago’s Back of Yards neighborhood. Prizes will range from $100,000 to $1 million, and children can win a college savings plan worth $150,000. Names in Illinois’ vaccination database will be automatically eligible for the lottery. Participants will be required to have a shot by July 1. Weekly drawings will begin July 8. “ ‘All In For The Win’ is yet another way we’re working to ensure every single resident is protected from COVID-19,” Pritzker said. Nearly 67% of Illinois’ residents have received at least one vaccination dose, and a little over 50% have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A grain mill that opened more than 180 years ago in northern Indiana saw a sales boom during the pandemic after it opened a drive-thru for customers eager to buy freshly milled grains. The historic Bonneyville Mill was closed to visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, like many Indiana businesses. But staff at the 1830s mill converted its original horse and wagon bay that farmers once used to deliver freshly harvested grain into a drive-thru for automobiles, which helped the mill along the Little Elkhart River rack up its most profitable year on record for grain sales, said Ronda DeCaire, director of the Elkhart County Parks system. “This was one of the few places in the Midwest where you could still buy flour and other freshly milled grains,” she told The Elkhart Truth. To prevent spreading the coronavirus, the mill’s staff used a pole with a bucket on its end to accept payments from drive-thru customers. Packages of flour and other milled grains were then handed to those customers through their car windows. “For the first time in over a hundred years, that wagon bay was busy again,” said Courtney Franke, the mill’s manager. DeCaire said the Bonneyville Mill is the oldest continuously operating grist mill in Indiana. It’s located just south of the Michigan border about 25 miles east of South Bend.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A divided state Supreme Court on Friday banned police from searching people’s uncollected trash without a warrant, outlawing an investigative technique that had been used for decades. The court ruled 4-3 that officers commit an unreasonable search and seizure under the Iowa Constitution when they look for evidence of crimes in trash left for collection outside homes. The tactic amounts to an unconstitutional trespass on private property and violates citizens’ expectations of privacy, especially in cities that have ordinances barring residents from accessing others’ trash, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote for the majority. “We do not question the utility of warrantless trash grabs for the purposes of law enforcement, but the utility of warrantless activity is not the issue under our constitution,” he wrote, adding that “garbage contains intimate and private details of life.” The ruling overturned Iowa courts’ long adherence to a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the search of garbage outside one’s home. Just a small number of other states have limited trash searches by holding that their state constitutions provide greater protections than the U.S. Constitution against warrantless searches.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: A judge is beginning to evict tenants who are behind on rent in advance of the expiration of a federal moratorium that some experts predict will bring a tide of people being forced from homes nationwide. Johnson County Magistrate Judge Daniel Vokins said during a Zoom eviction hearing last week that he doesn’t think the moratorium, which was issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and expires at the end of the month, is enforceable. Eric Dunn, director of litigation for the National Housing Law Project, said he has heard of judges elsewhere – including in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina – ignoring the CDC moratorium but couldn’t say whether it’s been a widespread practice. The federal moratorium has kept many tenants owing back rent housed. More than 4 million people nationally say they fear being evicted or foreclosed upon in the months following its expiration, census data shows. Making matters worse, the tens of billions of dollars in federal emergency rental assistance that was supposed to solve the problem has not reached most tenants. “We thought 2021 was going to be better, and it is turning out to be just as bad,” said Denise Wall, 31, of the Kansas City suburb of Shawnee, who applied for rental aid in March but is still trying to find out whether she qualifies.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: With tourists flocking to distilleries, concerns about a pandemic hangover for the state’s world-famous bourbon industry are quickly evaporating. A $19 million tourist center that Heaven Hill Distillery opened just days ago in the heart of the state’s bourbon country is already overflowing, with reservations filling up quickly to learn about whiskey-making and sample its spirits, including its flagship Evan Williams whiskey. It’s a similar story for the numerous other distilleries in the region that last spring were temporarily closed to visitors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year later, the businesses are facing such overwhelming demand for tours that one industry official has started encouraging people to call ahead or check tour availability online before pulling off the highway. Starting last summer, some distilleries began allowing limited numbers of visitors in accordance with coronavirus restrictions. With capacity limits now lifted, the attractions are gearing up for a full resurgence of guests, many from outside Kentucky. “We saw it coming, but I don’t think we saw it coming this quick,” said Kentucky Distillers’ Association President Eric Gregory, who predicted bourbon tourism will quickly rebound to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The iconic bald cypress trees will be protected on state-owned property, after Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a new law banning the trees’ harvesting on more than 1million acres of state land. Rep. Neil Riser said he sponsored the bill – which won unanimous passage in the state House and Senate – to give nature time to reestablish dense stands of cypress that once covered vast tracts of land. “The cypress tree symbolizes Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta,” said Riser, R-Columbia. “I hope this new law will help people have a true appreciation of these trees’ majesty.” The new law doesn’t apply to cypress trees growing on privately owned land. Cypress trees grow throughout Louisiana’s swamps and can have lifespans of more than 1,000 years. The bald cypress was named the official Louisiana state tree in 1963. Riser said the forests will return on state-owned lands with protection, though it will take almost a century for the slow-growth trees to mature. “They will come back with Mother Nature as the manager and forester,” he said. In a twist, Riser was involved in harvesting the trees as a teenage logger in the 1970s when forests were being cleared for farmland. “I remember my dad telling me, ‘Take a look at this forest; one day it will all be gone,’ and it was,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature has approved an initial proposal that would allow four Native American tribes to build gambling businesses on their lands, in a reversal from years of resistance and laws that opposed Native ownership of casinos in the state. Breaking years of opposition against the bill, the House and Senate approved it with an overwhelming majority Thursday, the Portland Press Herald reports. Rep. Rena Newell, a nonvoting member of the Legislature who represents the Passamaquoddy Tribe, gave a speech following the approval of the bill, which she had pushed legislators to advance. The bill was only a small part of what the state could do for the tribes in Maine, she said. “Our ancestors watched from inside the bounds of our reservation as nontribal members got rich from cutting down our trees on our land, leaving us with little,” Newell said. The gambling legislation is one part of a series of changes the Legislature wants to amend the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. If these amendments are enacted, the revisions would restore some of the sovereignty that tribal leaders say they lost years ago, according to the Press Herald. Maine voters have rejected tribes’ past proposals but approved referendum questions that led to the establishment of two corporate-owned casinos.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is awarding $10million to entertainment venues that struggled during the pandemic, including the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Maryland Theatre and the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, among others. The money will help stabilize businesses that had to shut down or drastically reduce their capacity as COVID-19 surged. As the state begins to emerge from the pandemic, the money will also help venues prepare for the busier fall arts season, said Nicholas Cohen, the executive director of Maryland Citizens for the Arts. “The arts season is a little quiet in the summer. It comes back in the fall,” Cohen said. “What this does is it helps float these venues until then, to really be like, ‘Here we are; we’re back; we’re maybe close to full capacity.’ ” The additional $10 million in state grants will go to more than 60 venues and organizations. For the nearly century-old Potomac Playmakers, the money will help maintain the nonprofit’s new home, which volunteer grant writer Greg Berezuk said the group moved into just before the pandemic shut everything down. “We got in there just before COVID. It’s a wonderful facility for an audience to enjoy a live performance, and we couldn’t use it,” Berezuk said. Fixed costs, such as the mortgage and utilities, had to be paid even without shows, he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A union that represents about 800 city employees who have been working remotely during the pandemic has filed an unfair labor practices claim against acting Mayor Kim Janey’s administration for unilaterally ordering them back to the office. The Service Employees International Union Local 888 filed the complaint with the state Thursday, the Boston Herald reports. “The City refused in good faith to bargain about health and safety issues, family and childcare issues (especially single and low wage employees), and productivity issues (as the evidence will show that many of the job tasks have been accomplished at a higher rate due to the use of virtual meetings and technology),” the union wrote in the complaint. Janey this month ordered remote workers back in phases in late June and early July. “The city did not explain why the return to physical work locations was necessitated on the dates picked for reopening other than they have the right to do it,” the SEIU wrote. In response to the complaint, a city spokesperson said in a statement: “Mayor Janey remains committed to flexibility, as we fully restore vital services to Boston residents. We do not have further comment at this time on the pending litigation.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People with a disability or a positive HIV test could not be discriminated against during the organ transplant process under legislation passed by the state House. Though the federal Americans with Disabilities Act bans discrimination on the basis of disability during the organ transplant process, organizations such as the National Down Syndrome Society say certain disability designations affect where a person sits on a transplant list, if they even get on a list at all. One bill passed by the House puts Michigan on the same path several states have taken, outlawing the denial of a transplant or lowering a person’s place on an organ waiting list because of their disability. However, no penalty for discrimination is listed in the bill. The other bill would allow patients with HIV to donate their organs to HIV-positive recipients. Both bills must be passed by the state Senate and signed by the governor in order to become law. Nationally, in 2013 the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act lifted a decades­long ban on transplanting HIV-infected organs into recipients. Current state law doesn’t allow Michigan residents to receive organs from individuals who test positive for HIV, so organs that test positive get shipped off to out-of-state recipients.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Staunch conservatives and advocates of legal marijuana have formed an unlikely alliance to pressure the Legislature to allow medical cannabis patients to own guns. The more than 35,000 patients in Minnesota’s program can’t own guns as the law now stands because the federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug, on par with heroin, and prohibits anyone who uses an “unlawful” substance from purchasing a firearm. So some gun-rights supporters and pro-legalization groups and legislators are lobbying during the special session to allow the Minnesota Department of Health to petition the federal government for an exemption. The change is being debated as part of the state’s public safety and health and human services budget bills. If their effort is successful, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports, Minnesota would be the first of 36 states that allow medical marijuana in some form to appeal directly to the federal government on behalf of its enrollees. The ranks of the state’s medical marijuana patients are expected to triple or quadruple over the next few years under a new law that liberalizes the state’s restrictive program to allow smokable marijuana instead of more expensive pills or liquid extracts.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The National Park Service on Friday accepted the city’s donation of land at a site that was once one of the largest slave markets in the United States. The federal agency eventually will develop exhibits that tell the history of Forks of the Road, where Black people were sold to work in slavery in Southern plantations from 1833 to 1863. The site in Natchez has had a sign and a small monument made of concrete and shackles. Officials have been working since 2005 on proposals to create a detailed memorial. More than 100 people watched Friday as the city donated nearly 3 acres to the park service in a ceremony that took place a day after President Joe Biden signed legislation to create a federal holiday for Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. on the date when enslaved people in Texas got word of the Emancipation Proclamation. “As we commemorate the celebration of liberty, Juneteenth, and we gather to remember the system of enslavement and the oppression the proceeded this freedom, we acknowledge the tragic story of what happened here at Forks of the Road and within the city of Natchez,” said Lance Hatten, deputy regional director for the National Park Service. “When that truth is told and heard, the journey to healing and unity begins.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated health officials in the area are imploring residents to get COVID-19 vaccinations as the faster-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus pushes case numbers and hospitalizations higher. Random testing of virus samples has determined that the delta variant, which is more infectious and potentially more deadly than other strains, has become dominant around Springfield and in much of southwest Missouri, said Kendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology with Greene County. Administrators at the two largest hospitals serving the state’s southwestern region – Mercy and CoxHealth – are pleading with residents to get inoculated because COVID-19 patient loads are increasing at a rate they have not previously seen during the pandemic, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. In Greene County, 36% of the population has begun the vaccination process. In most surrounding counties, the figure is below 30%. Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield, said hospitalizations averaged in the teens a month ago but reached 72 by Thursday. CoxHealth has seen similar numbers. Many of the new patients are young, healthy adults and pregnant women, he said. The delta variant “has become prevalent” across Missouri, state health officials said last week.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Wildlife officials are seeking feedback on a proposal to expand fishing restrictions to protect declining brown trout populations. Biologists with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Geological Survey have tracked declining numbers of juvenile brown trout in southwest Montana rivers, including the Big Hole, Ruby, Boulder, Beaverhead, upper Yellowstone and upper Stillwater rivers, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Eric Roberts, fish management bureau chief with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the trend is concerning because low numbers of younger fish indicate that older fish are not being replaced. Biologists are now gathering public comments on the proposed changes, which include seasonal fishing closures from September to May, catch-and-release requirements, and evening fishing restrictions from 2 p.m. to midnight daily. The changes could also apply to the rivers’ tributaries. Residents can submit comment online, by mail or by attending public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. Department officials will then develop proposals to be considered in August. Roberts attributed the trout population decline, in part, to changing water temperatures and habitat alterations. He said there are long-term plans in place to address stream flows and enhance habitat.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Amtrak trains are once again rumbling through the state capital on a daily basis. The California Zephyr, which runs from Chicago to San Francisco, has resumed its pre-pandemic schedule of one eastbound and one westbound train stopping in Lincoln in the early hours of each day. ProRail Nebraska, a group of citizens that supports the continuation of passenger train service in the state, met the westbound train at the Lincoln Amtrak station on the first day of resumed daily service, May 24. According to ProRail’s District 1 director, Richard Schmeling, ProRail opposed the pause in daily service, lobbying Nebraska’s federal representatives to support Amtrak through the pandemic. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said daily service was halted on many routes after the Senate declined to pass funding for the service during the pandemic. Now that legislation providing the funding has been passed and signed by the president, he said, Amtrak has resumed service at full capacity. “It enables us to be a better service in the 500 places we serve,” he told the Lincoln Journal Star. It also enabled Amtrak to recall more than 2,000 workers nationally that it put on furlough while service was decreased, Magliari said, including conductors, engineers and service people.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new kind of jackpot is coming to the Silver State, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday, but only for residents who’ve gotten a COVID-19 shot. The Democratic governor announced a broad effort to encourage reluctant or forgetful residents to get shots, adding his state to a growing list offering unconventional incentives to revive flatlining vaccination programs amid waning demand. Sisolak didn’t call it a lottery, instead terming the “Vax Nevada Days” prize program a raffle because entrants aren’t paying to participate, and vaccines are free. The program makes all residents who have received at least one dose of vaccine since December – along with military members and their dependents – automatically eligible to receive part of $5 million in prize money. Winners will be announced every Thursday for eight weeks beginning July 8. Students ages 12 to 17 can get college tuition credits worth $5,000 to $50,000. People 18 and up are eligible for prizes from $1,000 to $250,000. Among almost 2,000 winners, a $1 million grand prize winner will be announced Aug. 26. “If people are looking for reasons not to get vaccinated, they’re going to come up with one. I’m trying to give people 5 million reasons to get vaccinated,” Sisolak said, referencing the total cash prizes being offered.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is providing up to $1 million to encourage students to move off campus to ease a housing crunch this fall. Students can opt to have their names included in a one-time lottery for $5,000 to encourage as many as 200 returning students to live off campus, Mike Wooten, associate dean of residential life, said in an email to students who are on a housing waitlist. Dartmouth is shifting some of its larger doubles to triples and converting lounges to student rooms where possible, but that isn’t enough to alleviate the housing crunch, Wooten said in the email. “As expected, demand has exceeded our capacity,” he wrote. “Although this has been the case in prior years, interest in living on campus has understandably surged following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.” Some students said the school should be trying harder to house them – or at least better communicate why it can’t. “It hasn’t been made clear of what actions they’ve taken to mitigate this other than the lottery,” David Millman, a sophomore, told WMUR-TV.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Landlords won’t be able to inquire about potential renters’ criminal histories under a new law Gov. Phil Murphy signed Friday. The Democratic governor signed the Fair Chance in Housing Act on what was the state’s first official celebration of Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state workers. “We must commit to both remembering the past and continuing to take action to ensure communities of color, especially Black Americans, achieve the full equity they deserve,” Murphy said in a statement. He also signed legislation making the third Friday in June a state holiday. June 19 – or Juneteenth – commemorates when word reached enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, that slavery had been abolished. President Joe Biden signed similar nationwide legislation Thursday. The new housing measure aims to eliminate housing instability that contributes to recidivism, according to the governor. The new law won’t apply in cases where federal law permits landlords to ask about certain criminal convictions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday that all remaining pandemic-related public health restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activity in the state will be lifted July 1, clearing the way for restaurants and other venues to operate without any capacity limits and for cities to plan in-person Fourth of July celebrations and other summer festivals. The Democratic governor made the declaration as state health officials continued to crunch the vaccination numbers following a push that included a multimillion-dollar sweepstakes, other cash incentives and offers that included free child care for those who needed it in order to get their shot. Lujan Grisham wanted at least 60% of residents 16 and up to be vaccinated two weeks ahead of the reopening. Her office said that vaccinations stood at 59.4% on Thursday but that health officials were waiting for more federal data to come in that would push the state closer to its goal. Still, the governor said in a statement that she had hoped the numbers would be higher by now. “The variants across the globe and in the U.S. present very serious risks to unvaccinated people, even young people,” she said. “We all, each of us, have the power to stop the serious illnesses and deaths: Get your shot. It’s safe. It works. It’s that simple.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Fifteen months after shuttering for the pandemic, Radio City Music Hall reopened its doors Saturday for the Tribeca Festival premiere of a new Dave Chappelle documentary for a full-capacity, fully vaccinated audience. The debut of “Dave Chappelle: This Time This Place,” which chronicles Chappelle’s pandemic stand-up series held in rural Ohio cornfields, marked the first time the hallowed hall was packed since closing in March 2020. The premiere Saturday evening, the closing night gala for the 20th Tribeca Festival, was seen as a symbolic reawakening of the arts in New York, where many of the world’s most famous stages – Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Broadway theaters – remain dark. On Sunday, Madison Square Garden hosted its first full-capacity concert with the Foo Fighters. “Springsteen on Broadway” is set to resume performances June 26. After the Tribeca screening, Chappelle took the stage and paused for a moment to apologize for those who lost someone during the pandemic before signaling a note of revival. “But, man, let’s get up,” he said, before introducing a New York feast of hip-hop acts who performed according to their native borough, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Fat Joe, A$AP Ferg, Redman, Ghostface Killah and De La Soul.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed gun-rights legislation Friday that would allow parishioners at more churches to be armed, marking the second year in a row that he’s blocked the idea. The legislation affirms that people going to religious services at a location where private schools or some charter schools also meet can carry handguns in full view or under clothing if they have a concealed weapons permit. There would be other limits. The Democratic governor said the measure, which cleared the Legislature this month, would endanger educators and children. State law otherwise prohibits guns on educational property for nearly everyone. “For the safety of students and teachers, North Carolina should keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. The bill’s supporters contend these houses of worship where K-12 schools also are located are at a security disadvantage for their congregants compared to stand-alone churches. There are no such blanket prohibitions in these churches on carrying a pistol, provided the person has a purchase permit or concealed weapons permit. The bill also contains another provision that allows additional law enforcement employees – such as a civilian front desk worker at a police station – to carry a concealed weapon on the job if the police chief or sheriff allows.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators have again extended a deadline for Meridian Energy Group to begin construction on its $1 billion oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park or risk losing its permit. Meridian’s permit from the state Department of Environmental Quality was set to expire June 12 unless construction had begun on the Davis Refinery. Earlier this month the company asked for an extension on that deadline, citing delays related to the coronavirus pandemic and litigation. Recent lawsuits against Meridian have called into question the company’s ability to pay workers, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators granted an extension until Sept. 12 to start construction, a month short of what Meridian had requested. “The reasons seemed to make sense, and we thought, ‘We’ll give you guys the summer to hopefully work out your stuff and then start construction,’ ” state Environmental Engineer David Stroh said. “We requested an update from them in a little over a month so we could get a better feel for how things are progressing out there, knowing there’s a lot of attention to this facility.” Refinery opponents are concerned in part about its proximity to the national park. The North Dakota Supreme Court issued a pair of rulings last year clearing the way for the refinery to move forward.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Some casinos and racinos could be left with losing tickets if the state Senate’s sports betting legislation giving professional teams priority for obtaining brick-and mortar sports book licenses is ultimately enacted. A bill approved Wednesday by the Senate and sent to the House for consideration assigns the 30 total sports books to counties based on population. If professional sports teams in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati all decided to apply for licenses, casinos and racinos in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties would be shut out at the sports betting window of opportunity in the Senate’s bill. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, for example, has three professional sports teams as well as a downtown casino and a racino in the suburbs. Dan Reinhard, a senior vice president for the JACK Cleveland casino and a spokesperson for the casino and racino group Get Gaming Right Ohio, said Friday that the Senate bill “disrespects” casino employees. “An artificial cap that locks out gaming companies in the biggest, most populous counties doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “We know how to do this. This is the business we’re in. We’re going to work with all parties to make sure this cap is dealt with.” The original Senate bill introduced in May excluded casinos and racinos altogether.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Electric vehicle company Canoo announced Thursday it has selected Pryor for its U.S. manufacturing facility, which is expected to employ 2,000 people. The Los Angeles-based company plans to build its factory on a 400-acre campus at the MidAmerica Industrial Park near Tulsa. It will include a paint and body shop, along with a general assembly plant, and is targeted to open in 2023. “Oklahoma has always been a pioneer in the energy industry, and this partnership with Canoo shows that our state is an innovation leader in electric vehicle technology,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo and Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila to provide high-paying jobs for Oklahomans and position America as the global leader for vehicle manufacturing for decades to come.” Aquila cited Oklahoma’s strategic location and business-friendly policies as reasons Oklahoma was selected. Tulsa was in the running last year for a Tesla electric vehicle manufacturing facility that ultimately went to Austin, Texas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A second Republican in the state Senate is facing a recall effort after showing up to oppose a gun-control bill earlier this year. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports a Mount Vernon resident named Patrick Kopke-Hales has initiated a petition process that, if successful, could force a recall election against state Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale. Findley was one of six Republicans to attend a March 25 floor session, granting quorum to supermajority Democrats against the wishes of many gun-rights supporters. Though Findley spoke forcefully against Senate Bill 554 that day, Democrats passed the proposal to create new gun storage laws, ban guns in the Capitol and Portland International Airport, and allow Oregon schools and universities to implement their own bans. Senate Majority Leader Fred Girod is also facing a prospective recall because of SB 554’s passage, reflecting increasing pressure on Republicans to flee the Capitol over controversial bills after doing so to block climate change legislation in 2019 and 2020. The gun-control bill is currently the subject of a referendum effort that could give voters a final say on the law in November 2022. Findley said in a statement that “fighting for conservative values in Salem is my priority, not playing political games.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Consuewella Dotson Africa, a longtime member of the Black organization MOVE and mother of two children killed in the 1985 bombing of the group’s home, has died at age 67. A member of the MOVE family, Janine Africa, said Consuewella Africa had tested positive for the coronavirus when she went to a hospital around the beginning of the month but had largely recovered when doctors said last week that she was not getting enough oxygen. “Through the stress with everything that was happening, her body just could not fight to get the air in her lungs because she was too burnt out and tore down from the stress,” Janine Africa said. Africa’s death follows painful revelations in the past few months about the treatment of the remains of her two daughters who were killed in the police bombing of the organization’s Philadelphia home, where 11 members – including five children – were killed, and more than 60 homes were burnt to the ground. Her daughters, 14-year-old Katricia “Tree” and 12-year-old Zanetta “Netta,” died in the bombing while Consuewella Africa was in prison serving a 16-year-sentence for simple assault related to the city’s 1978 attempt to evict the group during which a police officer was killed. Consuewella Africa held the title “Minister of Confrontation” for MOVE, which identifies as both a family and an organization.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A town that was a center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade commemorated Juneteenth by unveiling a new marker recognizing its role in slavery. Officials on Saturday placed the first of two planned slavery markers in town at the Linden Place Museum, a mansion built in the 1800s by General George DeWolf, a prominent merchant and slave trader. Another medallion will be placed later this month at DeWolf Tavern. The markers are being installed at sites around the state connected to the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the Rhode Island Slave History Medallion project. They’ve been placed at Smith’s Castle in North Kingstown, Bowen’s Wharf in Newport, and Patriot’s Park in Portsmouth, according to organizers. Students and faculty from Roger Williams University planned to discuss their original research into the town’s slavery legacy. University officials say the work includes new information about the town’s lesser-known slave-trading families, as well as stories of enslaved Africans who lived and worked in town, such as Bristol Finney, a 19-year-old enslaved African who ran away from his owners. Saturday’s ceremony featured music and dance from a local African performance group, and the museum offered tours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDarlington: Historians are trying to shed light on five forgotten cemeteries in the state’s Pee Dee region. WMBF-TV reports the Darlington County Historical Commission and Clemson Professor Jim Frederick located the five graveyards near Dargan’s Pond on current Clemson property. The experts identified two African American cemeteries, two Native American burial grounds and a graveyard that dates back to the Revolutionary War. One of the sites is the cemetery of Cpt. William Standard, who was deeded land in Darlington County for his heroic service during the Revolutionary War. The pair of Native American burial grounds could date back more than 500 years. And one of the African American cemeteries is linked to one of the county’s oldest African American church congregations, the historians said. It started shortly after emancipation and was connected to the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, where it was active until the church moved locations in the 1950s. “It relates to an African American congregation that is one of the oldest congregations in Darlington County,” he said. “They lost their connection in a very unique way, and I believe there’s three factors to that.” The historians say they are now working to identify individuals in the old church cemetery.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union representing workers at a Smithfield Foods plant said Friday that its members have voted in favor of a new contract. Union leaders say the deal sends a message to the meatpacking industry that companies need to recognize the sacrifices its employees made during the coronavirus pandemic. The Smithfield plant was the nation’s most active hot spot for COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. Nearly 1,300 workers at the Sioux Falls pork processing plant tested positive for the virus, and four workers died. B.J. Motley, president of the Union Food and Commercial Workers Local 304A, said in a statement that the new contract includes fair pay, benefits and safety protections that workers have earned and deserve. “Ensuring these jobs continue to provide the good pay and benefits working families need is the best way for us to honor our country’s essential workers,” Motley said. The contract includes a base rate of $18.75 an hour, up from $17, and a $520 bonus. The union had voted earlier this month to authorize a strike after Motley said that Smithfield wanted the workers to pay more for health care and refused to increase pay to comparable rates of other meatpacking plants in the region.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A development that organizers say “is poised to become the second-largest Black-owned film studio in the United States” moved one step closer to fruition this month when the Land Use Control Board approved the zoning adjustments necessary to build BLP Film Studios, an 85-acre production facility in the Whitehaven neighborhood. “Our goal is to make Memphis the international epicenter for producing films and projects led by Black and brown creators on the production and directing side of those projects,” said Jason A. Farmer, 52, a former Marine and business executive who for the past few several years has been working to launch BLP, which he said would be eclipsed only by Tyler Perry’s facilities in Atlanta. Farmer said he believes BLP – the name is an acronym for Black Lens Productions – will attract investors as film and TV companies work to address the “diversity, equality and inclusion” concerns that have sparked debate within the entertainment industry. “Black and brown consumers are becoming more savvy,” he said, “and we find ourselves with none of the legacy production companies” that produce most of the high-profile content that brings customers to move theaters, cable channels and streaming service. He said groundbreaking is scheduled to begin in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on a threat Friday and vetoed the new state budget’s line item providing for legislative staff pay. The Republican governor had threatened the veto after a walkout by House Democrats in the final hours of the regular legislative session. The walkout denied a House quorum to vote on controversial voting restrictions that Abbott had prioritized. “Texans don’t run from a legislative fight, and they don’t walk away from unfinished business,” Abbott said in Friday’s veto message. “Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early, leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session.” However, a summer special session already was expected so that the Legislature can redraw district lines for congressional, legislative and other government offices. The budget is to take effect Sept. 1. Abbott is expected to push the voting-restrictions bill again during the summer special session. Rep. Chris Turner, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, engineered the walkout. In a statement Friday, he called Abbott’s veto “tyrannical” and the latest indication the Republican governor “is out of control.” The caucus is considering all of its options, Turner said, “including immediate legal options.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Home prices around the capital city jumped a staggering 31% over the past year in the latest sign of Utah’s housing crisis. Wasatch Front real estate agents have decried the dire lack of homes on the market as prices climb and sales bog down, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake County’s median price on a single-family home inched past the eye-catching $500,000 mark sometime in March and then reached $535,000 last month, new data shows. Average new home listings now draw 30 to 40 offers and sell in five days, the Salt Lake Board of Realtors said. The group said more construction is desperately needed to fill the gap. Nationwide, there’s a housing deficit of roughly 5.5 million units, according to an industry study that calls for ramping up the rate of U.S. homebuilding to add 2 million homes yearly over the next decade, compared with last year’s 1.3 million units built. In Utah, the shortfall is between 45,000 and 50,000 single-family homes, apartments and other housing types, with an especially serious need for more affordable homes accessible to residents making average wages.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont Food Systems Research Center is getting $11 million in federal funding to support its work researching the regional food system, from production agriculture to food security, UVM and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy announced Friday. The center is a collaboration between the university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, officials said. Vermonters turned to their local farms for food security when the pandemic struck, Leahy said in a statement. “Farms are an economic driver for our rural communities and local food is a defining feature of Vermont,” Leahy said. “We must continue to cultivate our food systems so our state can thrive and weather future emergencies.” USDA scientists are now being picked to work on campus with university researchers. “This is the first and only ARS research unit designed specifically to study diversified food systems and the smaller farms that contribute to those systems,” said UVM College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Leslie Parise. “We are proud to be leading this work at UVM and believe there is much the rest of the world can learn from the successful small- and medium-sized farms that characterize Vermont agriculture.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: After twists and turns on the road to legalizing simple possession of marijuana, advocacy groups have been flooded with calls from people trying to understand exactly what will be allowed under state law as of July 1. Legislators initially voted in February to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis for adult recreational use – but not until 2024, when retail sales would begin. An outcry ensued over the three-year wait before ending pot possession penalties, so in April the Legislature voted to move up legalization to this July 1. Adding to the confusion: Lawmakers included a “reenactment clause,” which means the General Assembly will have to vote again next year on major portions of the law, mainly to establish a regulatory framework for the legal pot marketplace. The process has resulted in some contradictions that may not get resolved until years after legalization begins. Sen. Adam Ebbin, one of the lead sponsors, said people “still need to be careful.” Possession of up to one ounce with no intent to distribute will become legal for those 21 and older. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four plants per household. But not much else will change. Buying and selling marijuana will remain illegal until 2024, when retail sales are expected to begin. Smoking marijuana in public also remains against the law.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing a bird found in the North Cascades as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to the likelihood that climate change will shrink its high-elevation habitat throughout the state. The Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan is found in the Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia to southern Washington, the Skagit Valley Herald reports. It is one of few animals that spend their entire lives on mountaintops. White-tailed ptarmigans move seasonally between snow-covered habitat and summer alpine meadows. As temperatures continue to warm, the region’s snowpack will decline. Alpine meadows may also be at risk as conditions move tree lines to higher elevations. “As the iconic alpine meadows of Washington diminish with climate change, this alpine bird … will be pushed out of the home it is specially adapted to,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Andrew LaValle said. The state Department of Fish & Wildlife lists the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan as a species of greatest concern and as highly vulnerable to climate change. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposal includes rules to protect the birds from types of intentional and unintentional harm and says a species recovery plan will be written after the listing becomes official.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice declared an end to the state’s indoor mask requirement Sunday as a $1 million winner was revealed in a drawing for residents who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Karen Foley of Mineral Wells won the top prize announced on a sweltering Father’s Day at the Capitol Complex during a celebration of the state’s 158th birthday. “Now we’re going to probably change somebody’s life in lots of ways,” Justice said before Foley’s name was announced. Prizes in separate drawings also held Sunday included custom pickup trucks, state park weekend trips, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, and hunting rifles and shotguns. Two younger vaccinated residents won college scholarships, including tuition, room and board, and books. Justice announced a series of random drawings May 27. The deadline for Sunday’s drawing was last Wednesday, and the winners were drawn Thursday. More than 246,000 West Virginians had registered. The names of entrants who don’t win will be carried over week to week. Residents can still sign up for six other drawings, which will be held on Wednesdays from June 30 to Aug. 4. The final drawing will include a $1.588 million grand prize and a $588,000 second prize.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson joined in a Juneteenth Day celebration in his home state only to see his speech drowned out by a chorus of boos. Johnson made an appearance Saturday at a Republican Party booth in Milwaukee, where he drew a growing crowd once people recognized him. Some people swore at him and said: “We don’t want you here.” Last year Johnson blocked legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Last week he relented while saying that “it still seems strange” that taxpayers should fund time off for federal employees to celebrate the end of slavery. The bill was quickly passed and signed by President Joe Biden. When asked what he thought of the boos Saturday, Johnson said: “This is unusual for Wisconsin. Most people in Wisconsin say, ‘You are in our prayers; we are praying for you.’ … But you got some people here that are just sort of nasty at some points.” One attendee, Robert Agnew, said he thought the reason for the taunting was that “Ron Johnson’s politics are not for us.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Supporters of two new marijuana ballot petitions say they’re optimistic about getting pot questions before voters next year, especially with growing support from conservatives in the deep-red state. Even so, they face daunting odds because of the difficulty of getting such initiatives on the ballot and failing to do so four years ago. The Legislature legalized hemp and hemp oil in 2019, but Wyoming is among a dwindling number of states that haven’t approved marijuana in some form. Thirty-six states now allow medical marijuana, and 17 have approved recreational marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This time around, some Republicans are finding common cause with Democrats and others on marijuana. “It’s well past due,” state Rep. Mark Baker said. “If they’re successful in reaching the ballot and putting the question to the people, I do think it is going to be successful.” Baker, R-Green River, stepped down as director of the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws after being elected last year. Other outspoken supporters include a state representative who last year became the first Libertarian Party candidate elected to a U.S. statehouse in 20 years. One petition would seek to legalize marijuana for medical use. The other would decriminalize it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}]}

Conservative critics have accused Twitter of suppressing the story at the behest of the FBI, something they claim the released communications, dubbed the “Twitter Files,” demonstrate.\n\nMusk himself has alleged the communications show government censorship, suggesting Twitter acted “under orders from the government” when it suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nBut so far, none of the released messages explicitly show the FBI telling Twitter to suppress the story. In fact, the opposite view emerges from sworn testimony by an FBI agent at the center of the controversy. And in interviews with CNN, half a dozen tech executives and senior staff, along with multiple federal officials familiar with the matter, all deny any such directive was given.\n\n“We would never go to a company to say you need to squelch this story,” said one former FBI official who helped oversee the government’s cooperation with companies including Twitter, Google and Facebook.\n\nElon Musk has suggested internal Twitter communications reveal improper behavior by the FBI in its effort to thwart foreign influence campaigns Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nMusk and his conservative allies have insinuated the released messages provide evidence of illicit behavior by the FBI, suggesting the exchange of secret files pertaining to Hunter Biden, and improper payments made to Twitter. But CNN’s interviews with people directly involved with the interactions and with those who have reviewed the documents disprove those claims.\n\nMatt Taibbi, one of the journalists Musk tapped this month to comb through Twitter internal messages for evidence of free speech violations, said himself on December 2 that “there is no evidence - that I’ve seen - of any government involvement in the laptop story.”\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that following Russia’s meddling campaign in 2016, plus after years of interactions with federal agents about how to spot foreign disinformation efforts, Twitter executives were hyper suspicious of anything that looked like foreign influence and were primed to act, even without direction from the government.\n\nBy the time the New York Post published its laptop story on October 14, 2020, Yoel Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, had spent two years meeting with the FBI and other government officials. He was prepared for some kind of hack and leak operation.\n\n“There were lots of reasons why the entire industry was on alert,” Roth said at a conference in November, not long after he resigned from Twitter. Roth insists he was not in favor of blocking the story and thought the company’s decision was a mistake.\n\nAs the released communications show, Twitter initially acted to suppress the story for a few days in part out of concerns that Hunter Biden, the son of the then-Democratic presidential candidate, was being targeted as part of a foreign election interference operation similar to the one Russia carried out in 2016.\n\nWhat Twitter did not know at the time was that Hunter Biden was the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Since as early as 2018, the Justice Department has been investigating Hunter Biden for his business activities in foreign countries. In late 2019, nearly a year before the story first emerged in the New York Post, the FBI had used a subpoena to obtain a laptop that Biden allegedly left behind at a Delaware computer repair store.\n\nAccording to sources at the FBI and at Twitter who spoke to CNN, none of that information was disclosed to Twitter executives trying to decide how to treat the laptop story, nor to anyone else for that matter.\n\n“It was an ongoing investigation, so I would never approve of talking about it,” said the former FBI official.\n\nGOP scrutiny\n\nWhile the released Twitter messages have yet to reveal a smoking gun showing the government ordered a social media company to suppress a story, Republicans on Capitol Hill say there are enough questions raised by the internal communications to merit calling tech executives to testify.\n\nScrutiny is building around the role of Twitter’s recently-fired deputy general counsel James Baker, a former top FBI official who joined Twitter in the summer of 2020. The released documents show Baker was in regular contact with his former colleagues at the FBI, giving rise to rampant accusations from conservatives that he was the conduit for the government to pressure Twitter.\n\nIn some of the material released by Twitter, an email shows Baker setting up a meeting – in the midst of Twitter’s internal deliberations about how to handle the New York Post story – with Matthew Perry, an attorney in the FBI’s Office of General Counsel. It is not clear what the two discussed.\n\nThe FBI declined to discuss any communications Baker had with FBI officials once he arrived at Twitter.\n\nBaker is among a number of former Twitter executives called to testify this month by Republican Rep. James Comer, the incoming chair of the House Oversight Committee. Baker declined to comment for this story.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY) attends a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 27, 2022 Drew Angerer/Getty Images/File\n\nComer also wants to hear from several former US intelligence officials who, days after the laptop story broke, wrote an open letter saying it had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” The group of former officials who signed the letter included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who, as a CNN contributor, appeared on the network to express his view.\n\nThough the former officials admitted, “we do not have evidence of Russian involvement,” their letter set the tone for much of the early discussion and coverage of the laptop.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the FBI said, “The correspondence between the FBI and Twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional, longstanding and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements, which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries. As evidenced in the correspondence, the FBI provides critical information to the private sector in an effort to allow them to protect themselves and their customers.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI work every day to protect the American public. It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.”\n\nAllegations of illicit behavior\n\nAmong the messages given the most attention from Musk and other critics are a series of emails between Roth and Elvis Chan, an FBI special agent based in San Francisco, where he focuses on cybersecurity and foreign influence on social media. On October 13, the day before New York Post story published, Chan instructed Roth to download ten documents on a secure portal.\n\nRoth responded, “received and downloaded – thanks!”\n\nMichael Shellenberger, who is among those Musk has entrusted with access to the internal messages, wrote about the Chan communication with Roth. Shellenberger does not describe the contents of the files, but he does insinuate that the timing of the message suggests Chan was secretly providing Roth information about the Hunter laptop.\n\nAt the FBI’s headquarters in Washington, a team reviewing the internal communications released by Musk says it has identified the 10 documents Chan sent to Roth. “I reviewed all 10 of these documents personally and I can say explicitly there is nothing in these 10 documents about Hunter Biden’s laptop or about any related story to that,” an FBI official involved in the review told CNN.\n\nThe official said eight of the documents pertained to “malign foreign influence actors and activities,” the FBI’s terminology for foreign government election meddling. The official said the other two documents were posts on Twitter the FBI flagged as potential evidence of election-related crimes, such as voter suppression activities.\n\nAnother interaction that has drawn suspicion is an internal message from early 2021 that Shellenberger cites showing that the FBI paid Twitter $3.4 million beginning October 2019. In the message, an unnamed associate emails Baker saying, “I am happy to report we have collected $3,415,323 since October 2019!”\n\nThe FBI says the bureau is obligated under federal law to reimburse companies for the cost they incur to satisfy subpoenas and other legal requests as part of the FBI’s investigative work.\n\nThe FBI describes its discussions with Twitter as the type of information-sharing that Congress and both the Trump and Biden administrations encouraged to help tech companies and social media platforms protect themselves and their users. The released messages appear to show that FBI officials repeatedly noted that it was up to the content moderators at the company to take action if a post violated their rules.\n\n“All the information exchanged is about the actors and their activity,” a second FBI official who reviewed the communications told CNN. “What we are not providing is specifics about the content and the narrative. We are also not directing the platforms to do anything. We are just providing it for them to do as they see fit under their own terms of service to protect their platforms and customers.”\n\nGhosts of 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 election, social media executives knew they had a problem. Russian operatives had used their platforms to run a massive covert influence campaign to help elect Donald Trump, using bots to spread disinformation and sow division among Americans.\n\nTo prepare for the next election, the executives set about bolstering their internal controls, including hiring former law enforcement and intelligence officials. But they also knew they had to forge a closer relationship with the US government to help root out foreign trolls and sources of disinformation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump chats with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in 2017. Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat followed were a series of regular meetings with federal agents that began in May 2018.\n\nThe released communications as well as interviews with people involved in the meetings portray routine, friendly and sometimes tense contacts between company executives and the government officials with whom they regularly interacted. Among the released communications are lively exchanges between Twitter and the FBI, revealing some of the sensitivities — and tensions — at play as the government and Silicon Valley slowly figured out how to work together.\n\nOne former FBI official who spoke to CNN recalls that tech executives would insist on meetings away from their campuses, in part because government agents weren’t welcome. Feelings in Silicon Valley toward the intelligence community were still raw since the Edward Snowden leaks detailed a vast data collection apparatus that targeted the tech companies.\n\n“Early on, who hosted the meeting was also a political football,” said a person familiar with the meetings between the government and Silicon Valley. “Each company wanted someone else to. There were worries about employees seeing a bunch of feds and leaking it in an inaccurate way.”\n\nOne tech source, however, dismissed this and said companies offered their offices for the meetings out of a shared sense of responsibility.\n\nNevertheless, the meetings went ahead. The first one took place at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park. Later meetings were held at Twitter and LinkedIn’s offices, a person familiar with the meetings told CNN.\n\nSome of the early interactions were terse. Reports published by CNN and other news organizations described complaints from some tech executives that the FBI was sharing only limited information, useless to help the companies protect their platforms.\n\nA telling moment came early on when a government lawyer lectured tech executives about the limits on what the government can do to help, multiple people who attended the meeting told CNN. One Silicon Valley executive described how the lawyer gave a 20-minute speech about the First Amendment and insisted that “government representatives can’t tell the companies to take any content down.”\n\nFormer Twitter employees and FBI officials involved say that by 2020, their discussions had become better coordinated and useful to both sides. One indicator of how advantageous the relationship had become: By 2020, Facebook was issuing press releases about some of the discussions.\n\nRumors of a hack-and-leak operation\n\nMusk and other critics of the interactions point to released messages that they claim show a cozy relationship between the government and Twitter. But the messages also show Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, repeatedly pushing back against asks from the FBI.\n\nAt various points, the Twitter communications show Roth resisting pressure to reveal certain information about users absent a formal legal request, such as which third-party VPN services were used by some account-holders to access Twitter.\n\nYoel Roth Patrick Farrell/Knight Foundation\n\nRoth also shut down a request that the company share more of its data with intelligence officials.\n\nOthers within Twitter noted the US government’s interest in Twitter’s data and urged colleagues to “stay connected and keep a solid front against these efforts.”\n\nConservative critics continue to blame Roth for Twitter’s suppression of the laptop story, but he insists he didn’t make the final call and says he thought it was a mistake. “It is widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story,” Roth said last month. “It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue.”\n\nExactly who in Twitter’s leadership ultimately made the call to block the story remains unclear.\n\nIn December 2020, Roth gave a sworn declaration to the Federal Election Commission saying the government had warned of expected hack-and-leak incidents targeting people associated with political campaigns. Roth said that he learned in the meetings with government agencies there were “rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.”\n\nRoth did not point to the government as the source of the rumor, but his claim that law enforcement agencies gave general warnings about disinformation campaigns dovetails with recent testimony from Chan, the FBI agent who played a key role in the meetings.\n\nChan was deposed this year as part of a lawsuit brought by the Missouri attorney general alleging government censorship of social media. Chan disputed that the government told social media companies to “expect” hack-and-leak campaigns, saying that it would have only warned companies it was a possibility.\n\nThat Hunter Biden might be the target of a hack-and-leak operation was being publicly discussed at the time, after it emerged that Burisma Holdings, a company he worked with in Ukraine had reportedly been hacked by Russian military intelligence early in 2020.\n\nChan also testified that government agents never raised Hunter Biden specifically, and that his name came up only when a Facebook analyst asked specifically for relevant information. An FBI agent in the meeting declined to answer, Chan recalled, adding that she was likely not authorized to address the question because at the time the FBI had not publicly confirmed its Hunter Biden investigation.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Donie O'Sullivan Brian Fung", "Evan Perez", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/03/despite-evidence-connections-skirted-state-scrutiny-years/7293570002/", "title": "Despite evidence, Connections skirted state scrutiny for years", "text": "Despite mounting lawsuits documenting financial troubles, public reports uncovering improper business practices, and warnings to state lawmakers that the nonprofit was in trouble, Connections Community Support Programs dodged state scrutiny for years.\n\nThe first sign of trouble at Connections, one of the state's largest nonprofits providing behavioral health and substance use treatment, surfaced publicly in 2011, when a former employee filed a lawsuit accusing the nonprofit of discrimination and failing to provide reasonable accommodations for their disability, according to the suit that was dismissed \"with prejudice\" in 2012.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

A special investigations unit of the Attorney General's office currently reviews cases in which police use deadly force.\n\n\"Some of this is the result of my having spoken with the attorneys in the office and this issue of internal conflicts and confusion about roles is something that came up frequently,\" Denn said.\n\nRichard Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP who has called for policing reforms, said Denn is \"doing the right thing\" by making civil rights a priority, but says any unit investigating police shootings should act independently of the Justice Department's leadership. Reardon will report to Denn through Gibbs, and will not operate with independence.\n\n\"The unit should be independent and have their own power to make decisions,\" Smith said.\n\nFred Calhoun, leader of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police who represents about 2,500 retired and active police officers, said there is no need for an independent review of shootings. Calhoun said placing reviews in the new office does not raise concerns for police.\n\nThe FOP, as well as the Delaware State Troopers Association, two police unions, endorsed Denn's campaign for attorney general.\n\n\"I don't believe we, the law enforcement community and attorney general's office, are really in need of a drastic change,\" Calhoun said. \"We are not like other states that have had issues.\"\n\nAlong with the announcement of the new office, Denn revealed details of his leadership team on Wednesday.\n\nState Prosecutor Kathy Jennings keeps her job overseeing criminal prosecutions, a role she held under Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\nMeredith Stewart Tweedie, who ran the department's health unit, was promoted to state solicitor, overseeing civil cases. Matt Lintner, who heads the office prosecuting consumer fraud, kept his job. So did well-respected Family Division Director Patricia Dailey Lewis\n\nEmily Cunningham, who worked as chief of staff to Denn when he was lieutenant governor, will serve as deputy to Chief of Staff Greg Patterson in the attorney general's office.\n\nDenn also promised Wednesday that lawyers in the new division will target public corruption, enforce election laws and work with the state's woefully underfunded Public Integrity Commission to enforce laws governing the conduct of public employees and high-ranking state officials.\n\nE. Norman Veasey, a former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and special prosecutor appointed by then-Attorney General Beau Biden to probe campaign finance corruption, called the office a \"very good idea.\"\n\n\"This whole problem of gift-giving to public officials and circumvention of principles of campaign finance, like using the corporate entity loophole, those things need to be addressed,\" Veasey said.\n\nVeasey, who was paid $1 million by state taxpayers to pursue public corruption, secured guilty pleas in state court from liquor executive Chris Tigani and Dover developer Michael Zimmerman for illegal straw donor schemes – reimbursing other donors to circumvent election laws.\n\nTigani also spent time in federal prison for tax fraud and violations of federal campaign finance laws. His illegal reimbursement scheme here included donations to Markell, Beau Biden, Denn and others.\n\nIt's unclear whether Denn, a Democrat, will use the new office to push for stricter campaign finance laws. He said the foremost concern for the Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is on \"fact-based issues,\" but if legislative concerns arise the office may work with lawmakers.\n\nIn the wake of Veasey's report, lawmakers resisted his calls to ban corporate entity contributions, ban gifts to public officials and provide resources for the Public Integrity Commission.\n\nThe commission acts as the state's ethics watchdog with oversight of 48,000 government employees, but has just two employees of its own and an operating budget of $193,500, which, after salaries, falls to $30,600. Rhode Island's ethics office was funded by $1.5 million in 2013, Veasey pointed out.\n\n\"I think it's great that the attorney general's office has recognized our need to have a partner responsible for enforcing the criminal penalties provided for in the State's Code of Conduct,\" said Deborah Moreau, the lawyer who heads Delaware's Public Integrity Commission. \"We are looking forward to working with the new division.\"\n\nThe new office will also \"have a better working relationship\" with the State Auditor and Elections Commissioner when concerns arise, Denn said.\n\nDenn hopes the relationship the new office will have with the public will be equally as strong.\n\n\"It will actually generate some calls from people who might not have known where to go,\" he said.\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.

Thaddeus McCotter debacle of faked petition signatures.\n\nWilliams’ petition was deemed insufficient May 23 by the Secretary of State’s Bureau of Elections, and a few days later, State Elections Director Chris Thomas agreed that the signatures appear to have been forged, according to minutes from a state Board of Canvassers meeting.\n\nBut Williams did not circulate the petitions herself, hiring a paid circulator instead.\n\nRelated:\n\nWayne County looks to ink sale of 'gateway' building\n\nMetro Detroit counties beef up road crews as winter looms\n\nAndrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Schuette, confirmed her office is investigating the case.\n\n“The Secretary of State office of inspector general has referred this case to us. This is an ongoing investigation, so I have to decline further comment,” Bitely said in an e-mail last week.\n\nWilliams refused to answer questions related to the case or her new position, referring a reporter to Evans’ spokesman Jim Martinez before abruptly hanging up the phone.\n\nWilliams’ attorney, John Pirich of Lansing, defended his client, saying “none of this involved Miss Williams in any way shape or form.”\n\nHe said Williams had hired a campaign manager who then subcontracted the work of collecting signatures to others.\n\n“We were appalled and absolutely outraged that funds had been paid and that … the activities resulted in her not being qualified” to be on the ballot, Pirich said. He could not say who the other individuals were or how much was paid.\n\nWhen asked about Williams’ role and oversight regarding her own campaign, Pirich said “hindsight’s always perfect,” and noted that political campaigns involve a number of different functions, which is the reason experts are hired.\n\n“To secure thousands of signatures is not a simple task. It’s a very, very arduous task,” Pirich said.\n\nA letter from Pirich to a state elections official dated May 26 requests “appropriate officials, including the Attorney General’s Office,” to address the actions of certain circulators in the petition effort.\n\nOf the more than 7,000 signatures filed with Williams’ nominating petition, more than half — 3,630 — were of “dubious authenticity where the signature on the petition did not match the voter’s signature on file, was written in handwriting that was substantially the same as handwriting for other petition entries, or both,” according to documents from the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office. Other problems included 457 signers not registered to vote or not registered in the district and 58 illegible entries.\n\nWilliams, who needed 4,000 valid signatures, was seeking to be one of the judge candidates to emerge from a crowded primary election field, which included former County Executive Robert Ficano, who lost in the general election.\n\nThe case is a reminder of the turmoil that swamped former U.S. Rep. Thaddeus McCotter, R-Livonia, in 2012. Several members of his staff faced election fraud charges when it was determined that only 244 valid signatures had been submitted out of 1,800 for the congressman’s re-election effort. McCotter resigned but was not charged, and Schuette called him “asleep at the switch” for his lack of oversight, according to Free Press reports at the time.\n\nWilliams, who will make $120,000 per year as assistant county executive, is a former attorney with the Farmington Hills-based law firm now known as Zausmer, August and Caldwell, where Wayne County Deputy County Executive Richard Kaufman was a partner before he joined the administration as Evans’ second-in-command last year.\n\nA biography of Williams notes that she “brings a long-standing passion and commitment to the law and public service to her new role as assistant county executive” and had worked as an administrative assistant for Detroit City Council, a Detroit police officer and general counsel for the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n“She’s been a dedicated public servant throughout her career, and she’s a great addition to (our) team,” Martinez said.\n\nIn a statement provided by Martinez, Williams said she “chose to return to public service to make a difference in the county that I’ve called home my entire life. I look forward to doing that every day.”\n\nIn the news release, Williams said she is pleased that the Attorney General’s Office is investigating the case.\n\n“I asked them to do so, so that the individuals who perpetuated this fraud on me will not go unpunished,” Williams said.\n\nThe fact that Williams’ campaign had such a large problem with signatures prompted Wayne County Commissioner Glenn Anderson, D-Westland, to question Evans’ decision to hire her for such a key spot.\n\n“Very disappointing that Mr. Evans would appoint someone who is under a cloud and was disqualified for submitting so many falsified signatures on her nominating petitions for 3rd Circuit Court. Unfortunately, this seems to be a pattern I’ve observed since joining the commission in (January),” Anderson said. “Either someone is being careless in failing to vet these appointments or they are indifferent to their ethical challenges. Either way, it’s inexcusable and Wayne County deserves better.”\n\nWater board nominee questioned\n\nIn addition to Williams’ position, Anderson was referencing a recently rescinded nomination by Evans to the Great Lakes Water Authority board.\n\nWilliam Phillips of Detroit had been Evans’ nominee to the board, but some Wayne County commissioners wanted a representative for Wayne County from outside Detroit because two other representatives on the six-member board are from the city.\n\nBut questions were also raised about Phillips’ previous connections to disgraced former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick in a WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) report on the same day Evans withdrew the nomination.\n\nAlthough he was not charged with a crime, Phillips had been treasurer of the Kilpatrick Civic Fund, which authorities alleged had been misused by the former mayor, who is now serving a 28-year federal sentence on corruption-related charges.\n\nAnderson said the primary concern for some commissioners was on the need for out-county representation on the board, which makes decisions about water rates, but he added that the Kilpatrick connection could be troubling.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of us who feel the county doesn’t need another black eye,” Anderson said. “The county doesn’t need that hanging over its head.”\n\nAnderson added that Wayne County is “hell of a big county … I think we can do better.”\n\nPhillips, who could not be reached for comment, is the president and CEO of P.I.E. Management, which has an office in Detroit, and assists businesses with call center, collections, payment processing and staffing solutions.\n\nIn addition to his position with the Kilpatrick Civic Fund, Phillips is listed as treasurer on two political action committees that owe filing fee fines to the state, including $14,900 for Generations Political Action Committee and $7,500 for Detroit Political Action Group. Both entities have been referred to the state Treasury Department for collections, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nCommissioner Joe Barone, R-Plymouth Township, said anyone who has connections to Kilpatrick would be a concern.\n\n“It’s probably not a good connection to have if that was true,” Barone said, noting, however, that his main concern is related to the makeup of the board. Barone said he did not believe his constituents would have been happy if the only Wayne County representative came from the City of Detroit.\n\n“I’m happy to see the county executive pull the recommendation, and I’m hopeful we’ll see someone from out-county,” Barone said.\n\nMartinez, Evans’ spokesman, pushed back against Anderson’s criticism about the administration’s hiring and nominating process.\n\n“We take the vetting process very seriously and will continue to do so. There’s obviously no perfect process. The bottom line here is Mr. Phillips’ nomination was rescinded after some commissioners raised geographical concerns about a Detroit-based nominee,” Martinez said, noting that two other board members — Gary Brown and Freman Hendrix, who were appointed by the mayor of Detroit — are from the city. “We’re in the process of working on another nomination. … The commissioners’ concerns were valid, and we’re taking that into consideration with our next nomination.”\n\nThe appointment is to fill the seat vacated by Joseph Nardone, who resigned Dec. 1. Nardone is the interim CEO for the Wayne County Airport Authority.

CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\nDurham, North Carolina, Police Department Headquarters. CNN\n\n“It’s been tough,” Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. “We’ve had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn’t necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.”\n\n“The 911 calls don’t stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don’t stop and certainly the emergencies don’t care if you are 60% staffed or below,” Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. “This profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.”\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n“You’ve got a workforce that’s being compressed on the front end, you’ve got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),” according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\n“It’s a trying time to be a police officer in this country,” Wexler said. “So, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.”\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n“Well, right now it’s not a very desirable job,” John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. “Everything that’s been going on around the country for the last couple of years. … But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.”\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to “bridge the gap” between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, left, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. CNN\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n“The goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,” Dickens said. “That means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I’m trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.”\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. “There was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then … everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,” Dickens said.\n\nTyrone Dennis CNN\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n“They got to do better with pay … incentives to retain officers,” he said. “It would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That’s not cool,” Dennis said.\n\n“Basically we’re one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?” Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. “When you think of what the line of work calls for and what they’re having to do, they’re wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they’ve got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can’t even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn’t match up with what the apartments require. That’s a problem,” Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is “alarming.” The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department’s “specialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,” Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more “liberal cities,” Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing “unprecedented” losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\n“Our losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,” police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. “Many of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the ‘defund’ movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.”\n\nSeattle’s attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year.

Individual donations from people related to these entities often total hundreds of dollars.\n\nLand use is one of the primary responsibilities of County Council members.\n\nCounty Council has a vote in shaping the broader sets of rules and regulations that dictate what can be built where and how quickly it can be built. Their latitude to vote up or down specific projects is limited to the ever-controversial rezoning. Rezonings are highly lucrative maneuvers for developers looking to double or triple the profitability of a particular parcel of land.\n\nFor example, County Council approved the rezoning of Cavaliers Country Club abutting the Christiana Mall retail megalopolis allowing for 700 residences to be built on the 150-acre property in June. The seven affirmative votes County Council made boosted that number from 200 allowed residences, likely bringing in tens of millions for the property owners and developer Carlino Development Group.\n\nShawn Tucker, who is an attorney representing Carlino, and two principals of the development outfit are among those who donated to the current Hollins campaign as well as Woods' previous special election campaign.\n\nWoods, who has raised about $28,000 since the beginning of this year, pointed to his vote against the Cavaliers rezoning as evidence of his independence.\n\n\"If people think they are going to get special treatment from me, that is not how it works,\" said Woods, who won in 2016 a special election for the council seat previously held by his father.\n\nHis district runs west from Wilmington through Elsmere, Newport and Stanton and south through the Christiana Mall area into Bear and includes the Cavaliers project.\n\nWoods is a business representative for the local Sheet Metal Workers Union and his donations also include support from organized labor.\n\nHe is being challenged by Jordyn Pusey, who has been a longtime official in her neighborhood civic group as well as the New Castle County Civic League, the area's foremost watchdog of development issues.\n\nShe has raised just over $7,000 and said her opponents' list of contributors creates at least an \"optics\" issue.\n\n\"If you are getting this money from developers, it looks like they could have your ear more often,\" Pusey said.\n\nShe described Woods' vote on the Cavaliers rezoning as \"token,\" because the effort already had enough support to pass by the time he voted against it.\n\n\"If you were truly against the development, you'd have been able to work with your council members to get solid opposition,\" Pusey said.\n\nDavid Carter, a former official with the state's environmental regulation authority and frequent commenter on county open space issues, is running for the council seat that represents western New Castle County south of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal.\n\nHe called on incumbent Councilman Powers to return the money he's raised from development interests.\n\n\"I just see it as a conflict of interest,\" said Carter, who has raised about $11,000 to Powers' $16,000.\n\nPowers said the donations are a non-issue.\n\n\"You can't buy my vote,\" he said.\n\nHollins has raised about $24,000 this year. Vincent White, a local realtor, has raised about $5,000 largely from organized labor. White said he hasn't looked at Hollins' list of contributions.\n\nHollins said County Council has protections built into the land-use process, such as the recommendation of project approval or disapproval from a separate planning board, that protect the process.\n\nHollins said the bigger problem is people taking loans during campaign season, not reporting it and saying it is for personal expenses — when it actually aids their campaigning. He lost against current County Council President Karen Hartley-Nagle in 2016 and pointed to a controversy that spring up last year involving her campaign.\n\nLast year, a constituent and former friend of Hartley-Nagle told County Council and The News Journal he loaned her $60,000 in monthly installments during election year and that she was not repaying him. That loan was not listed on her campaign finance documents and she said it was for \"personal expenses,\" though she loaned her campaign money multiple times leading up to the election.\n\nDEVELOPMENT STORIES:\n\nMore details revealed about $350M project on AstraZeneca property off U.S. 202\n\nCouncil approves rezoning, 700+ new homes at Cavaliers Country Club\n\nHercules golf course project hits familiar concerns\n\n\"That is the real evil. Be true in your reporting,\" Hollins said. \"The fact (that) I can raise money is not a crime.\"\n\nLarry Tarabicos is one of the county's top land-use attorneys and a longtime watcher of and donator to county politicians. He said he donates to who he thinks will operate government the best and does not expect anything in return.\n\nHe predicted that if the challengers upset the incumbents, they'd too be in line to accept donations from the same groups.\n\n\"Anyone who suggests a person can be influenced by a $600 donation probably has some insecurities themselves about whether they could be objective,\" Tarabicos said.\n\nThe primary for the County Council seats will be held Sept. 6.\n\nDelaware Primary Must-Reads\n\nDelaware primary candidates make final $707,000 spending push\n\nCarper-Harris Democratic Senate primary has gained national attention\n\nSocial issues separate Delaware's U.S. Senate GOP primary opponents\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

Advisers are already preparing the president’s annual State of the Union address, typically delivered in late January or early February, viewing the speech as an opportunity to lay down the stakes and themes that Biden could adopt on the campaign trail.\n\nThe first couple arrived in St. Croix on Tuesday, along with family members, a gathering of the tight-knit clan who, according to several people with knowledge of recent conversations who have spoken to CNN, have now pledged support for another White House run by Biden. Senior administration officials once viewed this week’s tropical escape as a crucial juncture that would play a major part in deciding his political future, and – while the president does still plan to mull with his family the pros and cons of mounting a reelection bid – people who have discussed the matter with him lately say the decision is essentially made.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN Exclusive: Pelosi and Schumer say Biden should run for re-election in 2024 02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nClues that Biden was expected in St. Croix were everywhere in the run-up to his arrival: the jumbo C-17 transport planes sitting among the puddle jumpers at the airport; temporary security checkpoints among the bougainvillea along the quiet coastal road; unusually high numbers of visitors from Washington.\n\nEven for a popular tourist destination accustomed to a wave of winter travelers, this week’s presidential visit has maxed out the island’s resources. Rental cars were all taken, and hotels were at capacity, according to residents.\n\nAfter the Bidens skipped the US Virgin Islands tradition the last two years, this trip may have some of the same vibes as one of their more recent vacations. In the early hours of 2019, when Biden was last contemplating a presidential bid, the couple were photographed taking a selfie at Point Udall in St. Croix on New Year’s Day, catching the first sunrise of the new year at the easternmost point under the American Flag, as the popular tourist spot is known.\n\nA decision had been made. Several months later, Biden would announce his candidacy for the presidency.\n\nPrivacy, please\n\nIn 2014, Joe and Jill Biden enjoyed their time on the island so much, they visited St. Croix twice – once to ring in the new year and again for a weekend in March, a quick getaway trip not on the then-vice president’s official schedule.\n\nIn 2015, the couple again passed the week after Christmas there, after deciding he would not run for the White House.\n\nIn 2016, Bidens spent the waning days of his vice presidency relaxing on St. Croix, ahead of Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House.\n\nBiden’s loyalty to the US territory has been the most high-profile of any American politician in recent history. A sitting American president has not visited St. Croix since Harry S. Truman in 1948. Truman arrived by yacht – the USS Williamsburg – and was hosted at an estate owned by the manufacturer of Jeeps.\n\nIn 1997, President Bill Clinton visited neighboring St. Thomas, another of the US Virgin Islands, for his winter vacation, chartering a catamaran with his family and snorkeling with daughter Chelsea.\n\nIn a 2020 statement, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said of Biden, “We consider him our hometown president.” Asked why the Bidens have picked St. Croix as their island getaway, Vanessa Valdivia, the first lady’s press secretary, told CNN, “Over the years, the president and first lady have frequently traveled to a warmer location the week after Christmas, going to the US Virgin Island several times.”\n\nFor the entirety of his presidency, Biden has skipped out when he can on weekends in Washington, DC, in favor of his longtime family home in Wilmington, Delaware, where residence staff and storied rooms aren’t a thing.\n\nSt. Croix, for the first couple, has provided that sort of intense privacy, plus the warmth and beach that the Bidens favor.\n\nDuring their visits in the years after Biden served as vice president, when his security apparatus dwindled and normalcy found a return to their daily routine, the first couple could be spotted around the island on occasion with virtually no entourage, driving themselves along the flower-lined roads in a rental Toyota sedan.\n\nThe home they leased was modest – only a few bedrooms – and was available at other times of the year for other tourists on vacation rental websites.\n\nYet on Tuesday, law enforcement was busy in the same area making preparations for Biden’s visit, including setting up flood lights and popping up white tents to act as checkpoints along the roadside.\n\nThe Bidens are staying at the home of his friends Bill and Connie Neville in St. Croix, the White House says. The president and first lady have stayed at the home of the tech executive on previous visits to the island.\n\nBeach people\n\nThe first couple are “beach people,” said a family friend familiar with their vacation preferences. Others who know them well said there is little more they enjoy when relaxing than pitching an umbrella on the beach, tossing a towel onto the sand and closing their eyes under a warm sun.\n\nTheir Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, neighbors are now used to being screened by Secret Service agents during beach walks, the telltale signal the president and/or first lady have walked down from their oceanside vacation residence to the beach for a respite closer to the waves.\n\nThe first lady, in particular, finds peace in her books and soaking up the sun. This spring, staff for Jill Biden – on a solo, whirlwind, three-country visit to Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – made sure to schedule private time for the first lady beside the pool at a resort out of Panama City, so she could lay out like dozens of other vacationers, steps from the waterside.\n\n“They both prefer hot and sunny and humid to wet and snowy and cold,” said another close acquaintance of the Bidens.\n\nFor the first couple, a true respite involves privacy as well, not just sun and warmth. St. Croix has fit the checklist. Locals have spotted the couple in years past at the grocery store, going mostly unnoticed as they shopped for vacation provisions at Seaside Market and Deli. Joe Biden has played rounds of golf at the Buccaneer Resort, a par-70 course described as “challenging, yet very playable” on the property’s website.\n\nThey have attended mass at the white-steepled Holy Cross Catholic Church in the island’s main town Christiansted.\n\nReelection discussions on the island\n\nThe break from Washington comes on the heels of a busy holiday season. Jill Biden – so tasked with dozens of White House celebrations, photo lines, family visits and general hosting duties that she had laryngitis for several days – is on her second week off from her teaching duties at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nFor Joe Biden, the stakes of getting away are not just about rest and recuperation.\n\nBarring unforeseen events or a sudden change of heart, Biden’s team is laying the groundwork for a reelection announcement in the coming months, putting to rest persistent speculation about whether the 80-year-old president would seek another term.\n\nCNN has reported that Jill Biden is “all in” on the 2024 campaign despite previous concerns about the deep implications of what a second run might mean for her family and her husband. She has, as one White House official told CNN, “zero concerns” about Joe Biden’s schedule and stamina.\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAside from the rigors of launching the final political campaign of his career, Biden will face a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, intent on stymieing many of his legislative ambitions. Republican leaders have also vowed to mount investigations into Biden’s administration and his family.\n\nWith his legislative prospects dampened, Biden plans to travel extensively in the new year promoting the accomplishments from his first two years in office. It will be an intense period that could ultimately include a rematch with his 2020 opponent, Trump – and one that will require the full backing of his wife of 45 years, along with the support of his extended family.\n\nIf there is a time to speak up on hesitations, either his own or from his offspring, it would be during this vacation.\n\nWayne Nichols, who leads Alexander Hamilton tours of St. Croix in the character of the founding father, recalled a 2019 encounter he had with Biden, with whom he engaged while the then-not-quite-presidential candidate was walking alone on the east end of the island.\n\nAt the time, Biden was also mulling a daunting campaign. After passing on a bid in 2016 following the death of his son, he was being encouraged by his family to mount a challenge to Trump.\n\nNichols said he stopped Biden to ask if he would run.\n\n“My question to him was, ‘Well, you’re going to run?’ He goes, ‘Well, I’m running now.’ And I thought, well, technically you’re walking,” Nichols recalled this week, wondering whether he might again cross paths with Biden.\n\nNichols came across Joe Biden a second time that week in 2019, while out for a walk on the island – Joe Biden up front, Jill Biden walking a few paces behind – when someone in the group told Jill Biden that her husband ought to run for president.\n\n“‘When you get up there, let him know that,’” Nichols said she responded.\n\nAs the Bidens make similar deliberations this year, they won’t be getting around in a rented Toyota and their stops on the island will go less unnoticed.\n\n“I have a feeling this is the place,” Nichols said of Biden often choosing St. Croix as his spot to find stillness for a consequential decision about the future. “Chilling there by the water with the nice weather. They get to talk about it. And I believe he’ll run again, only because I don’t know that he thinks there’s any alternative.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett Kevin Liptak", "Kate Bennett", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/12/09/potus-joe-biden-tv-appearance-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon/6458179001/", "title": "Joe Biden set to make first late-night TV appearance as president on ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is getting ready for his first late-night TV appearance since taking office.\n\nBiden is set to appear Friday on NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" with comedian Jimmy Fallon.

Yes. But also invitation only.\n\nThroughout December, the children of military families, frontline workers, first responders, educators and local school children will get to lace on skates waiting for them next to the rink.\n\nThe National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players’ Association, which helped support the rink, will give lessons to young, wannabe players.\n\nBiden said she’s trying to recreate for others the experience she and her sisters had growing up when they spent hours gliding across the frozen canals of the Delaware River.\n\n“In those hours, what was normally an ordinary town and an ordinary bridge transformed into a bright, sparkling landscape, and just glittering as if it were covered in magic,” she said. “And that's how children often see the world in this time of the year, with magic, wonder and joy.”\n\nMagic, wonder and joy is the theme Biden chose for the decorations inside the White House where she tried to capture the delight and imagination of childhood during the holidays.\n\n“What’s more magical and wonderful and joyful than being on an ice rink at the South Lawn?” Biden said as she stood on the rink with Boitano, the Washington Monument behind her as she faced the White House. “It’s so great to look out the window and see this.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time an ice rink has been erected on the lawn, but it’s been a while.\n\nIn 1980, Olympic gold medal winner Peggy Fleming performed on a temporary rink during holiday parties hosted by President Jimmy Carter for the Secret Service, White House military aides and other staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, Boitano joked that he’d brought an extra costume for the first lady.\n\nBiden, however, left the skating up to the professionals.\n\n“You know he’s scared to death that I’m going to fall,” Biden said as Boitano helped her get on and off the ice.\n\nShe was happy to watch from a folding chair on the lawn, under heat lamps, as Boitano, a 1988 U.S. Olympic and world champion, spun around the ice.

Naomi Biden, Biden’s oldest granddaughter, married Peter Neal on the White House South Lawn on Saturday.\n\nOne day following the nuptials, Biden will mark his spot in American history as the only octogenarian president, a numerical milestone that shines a spotlight on a primary issue plaguing Biden with his opponents: his age. Despite a spate of recent wins – better-than-projected midterm elections for Democrats, a relatively gaffe-less trip to Egypt and Asia, and a lackluster presidential announcement from his old rival, Donald Trump – Biden cannot shake being the oldest commander-in-chief America has ever had.\n\nBut a glossy wedding of two twenty-somethings, kicking off a fresh life chapter with music and dancing and revelry, could put a youthful spin on the 80th birthday weekend. Two people familiar with the planning of the wedding say it was not a coincidence Naomi Biden’s wedding weekend coincides with the president’s day – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\n“The wedding gives some cover,” says one of the people.\n\nThe wedding, which CNN is told includes the extended Biden clan on the guest list, as well as friends and family of the couple, also marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether Joe Biden should run for a second term.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Jill Biden and Joe Biden will travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the Thanksgiving holiday; Christmas follows quickly on its heels, as the clock ticks toward Biden’s need to say whether he will be in for 2024, or out. Both the president and the first lady have said they will weigh the pros and cons of a second run, something Biden has previously said he “intends” to undertake.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal, Saturday, November 19, 2022 on the South Lawn. Adam Schultz/White House\n\nA family affair\n\nThe wedding itself consists of three parts, a person familiar with the planning told CNN. The ceremony, which was set to begin at approximately 11:15 am ET and ended at 11:50 am, took place on the South Lawn – a location that hadn’t previously been used for a White House wedding. There was no tent, the source had confirmed earlier, which made for a chilly outdoor morning, with the temperature at 39 degrees. Guests arrived early Saturday morning to the White House complex, where they were all administered Covid-19 tests, two people familiar told CNN. They were given blankets and shawls at their seats to keep warm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the wedding details, the bride’s parents, Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked her down the aisle. As Naomi Biden walked down the aisle, the band played “Bitter Sweet Symphony” by The Verve. The bride wore a long-sleeved gown with a veil and train, designed by Ralph Lauren, the same sources said.\n\nJoe Biden escorted Neal’s two grandmothers – Paulita Neal and Betty Thum – down the aisle to their seats, a source said. The president then turned back and did a “classic Biden jog” up the aisle, according to the source, to meet the first lady and walk her down the aisle to their seats.\n\nThe program, which was seen by CNN, listed Naomi’s sister Finnegan James Biden as her maid of honor and her sister Roberta Mabel Biden, also known as Maisy, and Katherine Elizabeth Neal as bridesmaids. The groom’s best man was his brother Robert Eliot Neal, and groomsmen were listed as Joseph Robinette Biden IV and Charles W. Gerdts.\n\nPeter’s father, Dr. William Neal, who was accompanied by vocalists, sang a song during the ceremony, the source said. There was also a reading of the poem “I Carry Your Heart With Me” by E.E. Cummings, which was read by Amy D’Amato.\n\nThe bride and groom wrote their own vows for the ceremony, according to the source.\n\n“It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,” the president and first lady said in a statement released by the White House on Saturday. “Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we’re honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.”\n\nNotable attendees included former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Ted Kaufman of Delaware, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, who has served as White House Cabinet secretary.\n\nFollowing the exchange of vows, a smaller, family-and-wedding-party-only luncheon took place in the White House.\n\nThe celebration continued Saturday night, with approximately 325 guests – more than attended the ceremony – invited to the White House for dancing and dessert. The black-tie reception began at approximately 7:30 pm ET and was scheduled to end at midnight.\n\nThe president and first lady mingled with guests, according to two people in attendance who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. Guests were asked to relinquish their cell phones, the sources said.\n\nA massive, seven-tier wedding cake was positioned in the Blue Room, and Naomi Biden and her husband Peter Neal used a small ladder to climb up and cut into an upper tier. Guests were given slices of the cake as parting gifts – a tradition that Tricia Nixon, Lynda Johnson and Luci Johnson all did at their White House receptions.\n\nDessert stations were set up in the State Dining Room, and a large band was playing on a stage erected in the East Room.\n\nThe bride wore a strapless Reem Acra dress, according to the two people; she was also scheduled to change into a second party dress later in the evening.\n\nThe grandchild closest – literally – to her grandfather\n\nIn a way, Naomi Biden, 28, experienced a White House wedding thanks in large part to her own gumption. Biden, an associate at the Washington, DC, law firm Arnold & Porter, pushed her grandfather to run the first time.\n\nThough the patriarch, Joe Biden has always included his larger family circle, including his five oldest grandchildren when weighing life choices. His sensitivity to their feelings, and the invasive nature of a nasty political battle weigh heavy on his mind.\n\n“I don’t think there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family,” said Naomi Biden in a video interview played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThough typically called by the elder Biden family members, it was Naomi Biden who convened the most critical, in-person, all-hands-on-deck family meeting, the one that would have the most impact on Joe Biden’s future. Biden was concerned – they, however, were not.\n\n“He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to [run,] but really were calling it to be like, ‘Get in that race! Hurry up!’” said Naomi Biden. In the years since, it has been Naomi who has been most publicly vocal on her social media channels about Democratic issues, and championing her grandfather. On November 12, she tweeted, “Democracy wins in the Senate. Never think your vote doesn’t matter.”\n\nNaomi is also the grandchild closest – literally – to her grandparents. She and Neal, 25, a recent University of Pennsylvania Law School graduate who works at Georgetown University Law Center on National Security, moved into the White House last August, a person familiar with the living arrangements tells CNN.\n\nThe close proximity to the couple’s wedding site only increased their involvement in the planning. Jill Biden was primarily the person involved in the wedding planning, CNN is told, working with wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli, founder of Rafanelli Events. Rafanelli is no stranger to whipping up fantastical parties at the White House; he oversaw seven State Dinners during Barack Obama’s presidency, including the final of the administration for Italy, which included a tent with a glass ceiling on the South Lawn and a performance by Gwen Stefani.\n\nHe also planned and orchestrated the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010.\n\nA Rafanelli-produced wedding is not an inexpensive endeavor. The price tag for many of his events starts at around $300,000 and can go into the millions of dollars. “Consistent with other private events hosted by the First Family and following the traditions of previous White House wedding festivities in prior Administrations, the Biden family will be paying for the wedding activities that occur at the White House,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN.\n\nNaomi Biden’s parents, who divorced in 2017, have each written memoirs about struggles in their relationship, many of which involved Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction.\n\nNeal’s family is from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the couple was engaged in September 2021. (The engagement ring includes the band of Neal’s grandmother’s engagement ring and was designed by a DC jeweler, a person with knowledge of its construction told CNN.)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal on Saturday, November 19, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House.

Reuters In pictures: A history of White House weddings Prev Next\n\nThe social event of the White House this year\n\nNaomi Biden’s choice of a Ralph Lauren as the designer of her wedding dress was not a total surprise; several fashion insiders previously contacted by CNN had speculated that the job had gone to Lauren, perhaps the most iconic American fashion designer alive today.\n\nJoe Biden is partial to Lauren’s suits, having worn one on Inauguration Day, and Jill Biden has also been photographed wearing the label. In March, Naomi and her sister Finnegan, 23, and Neal, attended Ralph Lauren’s Fall 2022 fashion show in New York City, which sparked most of the chatter that she will wear the designer for at least one of her wedding looks. The White House did not comment on the dress speculation, but two people familiar told CNN the bride would wear two different wedding looks, one for the ceremony and one for the reception.\n\nDespite several protestations from the White House Correspondents’ Association, asking that media coverage be allowed as the wedding is taking place at the people’s house, the White House was adamant that the bride and groom wanted privacy for their nuptials.\n\nFloral garlands of white roses and other blooms were hung from the Truman Balcony, and woven along the staircases down to the South Lawn; large matching wreaths and a floral arch surround the entrance to the Diplomatic Room. It is only the 19th wedding to ever take place at the White House, the last one was for Obama’s chief photographer, Pete Souza, who in 2013 was married in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe last presidential daughter to celebrate a wedding at the White House was Jenna Bush in June 2008. Bush held her wedding and reception months prior at the Bush family’s Texas ranch, but her father, George W. Bush, hosted approximately 600 guests at the White House for his daughter’s second reception.\n\nBut the scope and scale of the Biden wedding most correlates with that of Luci Johnson, who held her reception in the East Room after marrying Patrick Nugent, and Lynda Johnson, who in 1967 married Charles Robb in the East Room of the White House. Tricia Nixon in June 1971 married Edward Finch Cox under a flower-laden white gazebo erected in the Rose Garden.

The photograph was taken on a block only a few steps away from where he's standing.\n\nHall has grown up in a neighborhood that never rebounded from the devastating upheaval that began just days after Martin Luther King Jr. was cut down by an assassin's bullet on April 4, 1968.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the killing and ensuing violence, which left a lasting dent in West Center City, comes next week.\n\nFive decades have now passed since smoke billowed from burning homes and businesses as residents lashed out by looting, firebombing and vandalizing in the wake of the King's death.\n\nAbout 2,800 National Guardsmen took over the job of keeping the city safe for nine months, the longest occupation of an American city since the Civil War.\n\nIntersection of West Eighth Street and Madison Street\n\nAnd while we look back, Wilmington officials are looking ahead.\n\nThey are 10 months into a new \"holistic\" plan — dubbed the Neighborhood Stabilization Program — to invigorate the neighborhood where the riots originated long ago. There is even a \"West Center City War Room\" with map-covered walls that opens directly into Mayor Michael Purzycki's ninth-floor office.\n\nIt has been met with enthusiasm by some and apprehension by others, worried about concerns of possible gentrification and being priced out of the area eventually.\n\nInvolving nearly all of the city's departments and more than 15 other cooperating agencies, officials have been busy acquiring vacant properties that had been neglected or whose owners were in debt to the city.\n\nThey even purchased a pair of \"nuisance\" liquor stores that will be sold and reopened as something more positive for the neighborhood.\n\nIf it's a success, the plan will be a model for other city neighborhoods in need.\n\nWith his first term following the election of the city's first three black mayors who were more intimately familiar with the neighborhood, Purzycki admits he didn't even know about all the previous attempts to help West Center City.\n\n\"The last I heard about West Center City was that it got burnt down,\" says Purzycki, 72, who had been executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp. for 20 years before being elected mayor in 2016.\n\nThere are still cavities along streets where buildings are missing after being burnt down. Small businesses, schools and other hubs that had populated the area never returned. But that's all ancient history to Hall.\n\nThe West Sixth Street resident is too busy avoiding gun violence in the streets and doing everything he can to escape falling into homelessness again, which had left him crashing with a cousin for a time.\n\nEven so, he likes living in his hometown neighborhood, even if much of it has stood still in time since 1968.\n\nAs he bluntly puts it: \"If you know people around here, you're good. If you come around here and want to start trouble, there's not a good chance of you surviving.\"\n\nWith the anniversary of Wilmington's riots on Wednesday, another anniversary is approaching in May: It will be one year since Purzycki announced the West Center City neighborhood would be the first stop for his new program.\n\nThe idea is to leave West Center City a better place for Hall's generation and beyond through a comprehensive approach, revitalizing the struggling area and making it safer and better looking.\n\nThe tool? An inter-agency plan that includes cracking down on neglected and nuisance properties, increasing police presence and even adding more trash pickups to keep the streets cleaner.\n\nWest Seventh Street between Windsor and Jefferson streets\n\nIt's not the first time the city has focused on the area that bounds Fourth to 10th streets and Adams to Tatnall streets.\n\nThere was the 1969 city push with federal funds to rehabilitate homes; 1988's West Center City Initiative; and 2005's HOPE Commission, which was to target underserved communities, but funding cuts never got the project out of Southbridge, its first stop.\n\nAnd now it is 2018 and the latest long-term push is nearly a year old.\n\nWest Center City was once filled with schools, parks and small businesses before 1953's federal-backed urban renewal and the construction of I-95 in the early 1960s, which severed the neighborhood from most of Wilmington. Both events made the area unstable by displacing residents. Rentals took over in an area where home ownership once thrived.\n\nWhen Purzycki's plan was announced, its goals were set by the project's working group. Participants include city officials, residents, police, church leaders, state agencies such as the Division of Alcohol & Tobacco Enforcement and the Delaware Contractors Association.\n\nHere are a few of the announced goals:\n\nReduce crime, drug sales, gang activity and prostitution through a five-person police team dedicated to the neighborhood, in addition to its usual coverage.\n\nEnforce laws when it comes to liquor and convenience stores, making sure they don't contribute to \"neighborhood instability\" by allowing loitering and other activity.\n\nHold property owners accountable for the upkeep of the homes, inside and out, while using sheriff sales for those who neglect their properties or are in debt to the city.\n\nReduce trash on the streets and enforce the city law that the landlord provide a trash can to residents.\n\nSpend $3.3 million to improve the only city-owned community center – the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center – located in the heart of West Center City and built in 1972 after fires from the riot swept through the block.\n\nMadison Street between West Sixth and West Fifth streets\n\nWith 10 months of work under its belt, some progress has been made, but longer-term projects like acquiring neglected properties and rehabbing them for affordable resale will take longer.\n\nFrom the West Center City War Room, here's what they've been able to accomplish so far:\n\nThere has not been a shooting in West Center City in four months, according to News Journal statistics. The last one came Nov. 22 in the area of West Seventh Street and North Tatnall Street, right on the neighborhood's border.\n\nCalls by residents to police more than doubled in the first five months with a dedicated West Center City police unit. Officials say the uptick shows more trust between the police and the community, which is getting to know the highly visible officers walking the block.\n\nCalls by residents to police more than doubled in the first five months with a dedicated West Center City police unit. Officials say the uptick shows more trust between the police and the community, which is getting to know the highly visible officers walking the block. The city has acquired about 20 vacant properties at no cost that had been neglected or had owners that owed the city money. They will be rehabbed for future use via loans Purzycki is negotiating through local banks and will be resold at affordable prices.\n\nThe neighborhood's largest private landowner, George Beers, who owns 84 parcels, is also working with the city and is on the working group. The Wilmington Housing Authority also owns 19 properties set for rehab.\n\nThe neighborhood's largest private landowner, George Beers, who owns 84 parcels, is also working with the city and is on the working group. The Wilmington Housing Authority also owns 19 properties set for rehab. The city purchased the pair of liquor stores – West Seventh and Washington streets and West Eighth and Jefferson streets – which will close in the near future and will be resold.\n\nThey cost a total of $527,000 with the money coming from the Department of Real Estate and Housing's capital fund, which is used for property acquisition, stabilization and demolition. \"That's a huge positive,\" says Michele Billups, who has lived in West Center City for more than 50 years and lives a block from the Washington Street liquor store. \"Our neighborhood association has been jumping up and down about that liquor store for years.\"\n\nThe $3.3 million worth of improvements at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center has begun, the first renovation in the center's 46-year history.\n\nInstead of picking up regular trash one day and recycling the next, the city switched West Center City over to two regular trash pickups, ditching recycling efforts for the time being in an area with about 9 percent participation. Other street-level infrastructure improvements such as new crosswalks, street signs and lights have been done by the city's Department of Public Works, which absorbed the cost.\n\nWilmington police Chief Robert Tracy, who joined the force just a month before Purzycki's May announcement of the program, says he is pleased with the progress of his new unit but cautions that it will take time for the program to take hold.\n\n\"It's still early. We have a long way to go in all parts of what we're doing, but it's very promising what we've been seeing in recent months,\" says Tracy, who previously served as chief criminal strategist for the Chicago police from 2011 to 2016. \"Am I surprised at these results? Not with our capability and if we do things right.\n\n\"I'm happy with what I see, but I just want to make sure we don't take our foot off the pedal.\"\n\nThe corner of West Fifth Street and Washington Street\n\nOne of the neighborhood's elders, Mercedes Fields, has lived in the area for 48 years and is on the program's working group. In her 70s, she works at the \"Hicks\" Anderson Center and \"has seen it all.\"\n\n\"It all\" includes the past failed attempts at permanently uplifting the area. If anyone has a right to be leery, it's her.\n\nBut she says she has seen small steps of progress with her own eyes — less nighttime loitering on corners, news street signs and less trash on the streets.\n\n\"Small things like that make a difference. In your house, if you pick up your sweater and hang it up, your house won't look junky,\" Fields says.\n\nPurzycki projects confidence that this all-hands-on-deck approach under his administration will work.\n\n\"This is going to be a beautiful neighborhood; it really is,\" he says. \"Without trying to be critical of anybody or any generation, we have been irresponsible, unrespectful to people and neglectful of our poor neighborhoods for a long, long time. I don't think it was malice. Was it subliminal racism? I think so.\"\n\nThey chose West Center City for several reasons, he says.\n\nIt is compact with easily defined borders and has good institutional allies like nonprofits, along with a community center in its heart. Also, there's strength in downtown, the area contiguous to West Center City's east side, along with neighbors in the area such as Trinity Vicinity and Quaker Hill.\n\nLike Purzycki, Chief Tracy now is familiar with the long history of aborted attempts to elevate West Center City and still believes that this time will be different with their plan now in action.\n\n\"A lot of people don't have the patience to educate and build trust through community engagement. A lot of people don't have the patience to do. We give up too soon. We're in this for the long run,\" Tracy says.\n\nFormer Wilmington Mayor James Baker, who held the post for 12 years, says funding problems were at the heart of just about every failed West Center City push. He's watched them come and go with great interest since he was there in the neighborhood in 1968 at the age of 25, volunteering with the anti-poverty program AmeriCorps VISTA.\n\nHe saw the fire, anger and dissatisfaction firsthand.\n\n\"Progress was not coming fast enough in these neighborhoods,\" Baker says, pointing to a growing divide between elders and the youth.\n\n\"Young people were speaking out in a more radical fashion. It was almost an isolationist movement saying, 'Hey, we're going to do this ourselves.' They felt freedom had to be now, not incremental.\"\n\nWatching the neighborhood go up in flames was less scary than frustrating, Baker says. There wasn't anything that he or anyone else could say to the kids, who didn't see themselves as rioters, but rather as freedom fighters striking back at the power establishment.\n\n\"How do you talk to them after assassination?\" he asks 50 years after not finding an answer then. \"It was like a tsunami. Once it started, it was too big to just go in there and say, 'Hey, stop it! This is your neighborhood!'\"\n\nAfterward, the neighborhood was left a desolate mess with most of the white and many of the middle-class black families leaving along with businesses.\n\n\"It was like Humpty Dumpty — you just couldn't put it back together again so it froze in place,\" Baker says.\n\nThe most recent attempt at a thaw has come with Purzycki in charge, and Baker agrees that a coalition approach is needed. But his worries are the same as they were when he was mayor: Is there enough money to get the job done?\n\nBaker has seen Purzycki's plan and suggests he would start smaller, going incrementally east to west with a dozen blocks, starting its build out from the strengthful (and well-supported) downtown and going across to Washington Street.\n\n\"This has to be looked at in the long term, and you just take a bite. When you try to do the whole area, you're not going to make it happen,\" he says.\n\nAnother Neighborhood Stabilization Plan doubter is the president of the West Center City Neighborhood Association (and frequent Purzycki administration critic) Dwight Davis.\n\nThe whole push isn't needed, he says, and the work of grassroots organizations supported by city and federal funds in the neighborhood have been effective.\n\n\"The government organizations need to take a look at what's already working in West Center City and not attempt to come in and create another existence. These things are already in place,\" says Davis, who is not on the city's West Center City Working Group and opposes the push of sheriff's sales against property owners.\n\n\"We need to continue what we've been doing.\"\n\nPurzycki is used to criticism by now.\n\nWith his history revitalizing the once-barren Riverfront, he's been met with concern by some ever since he announced his mayoral campaign, especially among African-Americans worried about being pushed out of their neighborhoods.\n\n\"I get it that some people are very distrustful of me, but by the way, the Riverfront was not gentrified. It was a dump,\" he says. \"No one ever lost their house nor would I ever want it to be said about me that I removed someone from a home to bring middle-class people in. That's not who I am.\n\n\"I don't want that. No one is going to ever have to worry about that happening.\"\n\nBillups, who moved to West Center City before the events of 1968, says some in the neighborhood are wary of the program, given the past history in both Wilmington and across the country when it comes to moving people out of neighborhoods and gentrification.\n\nAs a member of the program's working group, she says she believes the mayor is a good man and takes him at his word about the intentions behind the program. But she stresses that she and others also will hold him to those words.\n\n\"When you start seeing money being put in your neighborhood after years of blight, you think about what's the honest motivation behind it. I have some trepidation about it as well,\" she says. \"That's where the butterflies in the stomach come from. I want the city to grow and be beautiful. And I want to see beautiful people living in the community, including black people.\"\n\nFor Joey Hall, the life-long West Center City resident, that's good news. He doesn't want to leave. He's cheering on efforts to create more affordable housing and the push to beautify and clean up the neighborhood. He thinks it could help.\n\nAs for the addition of the police team, he's doubtful they will make a sustained impact, even if shootings are currently down in the area. If they do succeed, he says it will be the first time he's seen it.\n\n\"No matter what you do, it's not going to be safer. Cops cracking down? They've been trying that for the longest,\" Hall says. \"This is Wilmington, man. People get killed over the dumbest [stuff].\n\n\"I'm glad they're trying, but I don't have much hope. I've been here since I came out of my mother's womb, know what I'm saying? And nothing has changed.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Parker exiled him not because he thought the young man would find trouble; he worried trouble would find him.\n\n\"Kids are losing their lives by stray bullets, by bullets that aren't even meant for them,\" Parker said. \"You never know when something like that may happen.\"\n\nThis year, crime is down in Wilmington. All crime, not just lower level incidents.\n\nParker spent part of Sunday afternoon on his front step, looking out across West Fourth Street into West Center City. It's an iconic neighborhood and a troubled one.\n\nResidents have noticed positive change since it became the focus of city and police initiatives, as new crime reduction strategies took root. But after years of neglect and similar strategies, incremental improvements haven't changed every resident's mind.\n\nThere have been fewer crimes reported in the police district containing West Center City than at this time last year, according to Wilmington Police Department statistics. That reduction is most dramatic in the number of shootings.\n\nFifteen people were shot there by July 8, 2017. That number this year is four.\n\nYet the most recent killing by gunfire in the city occurred on July 18 in West Center City, when Sean Spencer, a 50-year-old dad, was shot inside his own front door.\n\nMan shot dead in Wilmington, reportedly trying to save son\n\nWest Center City is the heart of Police District 16, an area that extends beyond the neighborhood borders. Reported crime there has followed a citywide trend down from 2017, according to the most recent police department statistics, which run through July 8.\n\nIn the district, overall reported crime is down 9 percent from the the prior year. Citywide, reported crime is down 10 percent.\n\n\"We've been almost all through the summer without having a bunch of incidents,\" said Caren Turner, a lifelong West Center City resident, neighborhood activist and the district councilman's mother. \"We have got to look at that as a plus for our community.\"\n\nOnly two areas, both above the Brandywine, saw an overall increase in crime this year in the most recently released statistics. One district saw no change, and every other police district in Wilmington saw an overall reduction.\n\nOne of the two with increases includes the Ninth Ward, north of Brandywine Park, where 20-year-resident Vanessa Watson was surprised to hear the number of reported crimes is falling across in the city.\n\n\"I don't feel it,\" Watson said. \"Safer? Am I really?\"\n\nWatson said she wouldn't walk the few blocks from her front step to the nearby Citgo station at night. There was a time Watson would have, she said.\n\nWord travels fast in her neighborhood. Watson said when gunshots echo or someone breaks into a car, a telephone network spreads the news from neighbor to neighbor.\n\nThe 3 percent increase in reported crime for Police District 14, which contains the 9th Ward, the Triangle, Harlan and Brandywine Hills, is statistically insignificant. It represents nine more crimes being reported over the same time last year: two more robberies, 16 more thefts and two more stolen cars. Other categories of crime went down, but by single digits, according to police statistics.\n\nThe 9 percent decrease for the West Center City area represents 33 fewer crimes reported this year than the same time last year. Only thefts are up there, from 174 to 190. Robberies are down by 11, aggravated assaults by 14, burglaries by 11, thefts by 16, and auto thefts by eight, according to police statistics.\n\nGun violence is the barometer of Wilmington crime for residents and everyone else.\n\n\"That's probably the single most important statistic,\" said Mayor Mike Purzycki.\n\nLast year was Wilmington's deadliest ever for gun violence: 197 people shot, 32 fatally.\n\nWilmington’s deadliest year: Mayor withholds 'serious concern' until plan takes hold\n\nThere were 95 shootings with 108 victims by July 8, 2017. This year by that date there were 42 shootings with 45 victims.\n\nWest Center City was chosen for Mayor Mike Purzycki's Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a focus of police, city and nonprofit energies to clean up and revitalize it.\n\nIt is not the first time the neighborhood been the subject of a \"turnaround\" plan.\n\n\"Our strategies over there have proven to me that if you do the basics, you see results,\" Purrzycki said. \"You just get an overall sense that the community is better.\"\n\nPart of a citywide policing strategy has a particular role to play in West Center City: The return of community policing as the go-to word in fighting crime.\n\n\"We're getting better at it but we're nowhere near where we need to be,\" Police Chief Robert Tracy said. \"We're just starting to really hit our stride.\"\n\nTracy has tried to bring the department back to community policing from a culture focused on answering calls for service. In the old strategy, officers were more specialized in their duties, less tied to geography.\n\n\"Now they're all kind of doing it all-in-one,\" Tracy said. \"That's why you're starting to see some of the crime come down in other areas, not just the violent crime.\"\n\nTracy has taken \"zero tolerance\" out of the Wilmington police vernacular. He is focusing on people and groups with the highest propensity for violence.\n\nWilmington: most dangerous place in America for youth\n\n\"We have a process for identifying them. But if I don't have the same officers working in the same areas every time they're out, they're not going to know,\" Tracy said.\n\nTurner now recognizes the officers in West Center City. She sat last week in Helen Chambers Playground across from the Hicks Anderson Community Center and pointed out which cops she knew and which she didn't.\n\n\"We know the police officers on a first-name basis. They're out here. They're walking, they're riding their bikes,\" Turner said. \"I think it's working.\"\n\nParker doesn't know the names of cops walking his neighborhood, but he knows faces.\n\n\"Just having them in the area puts just a little bit more of a security blanket over some of the residents here. They (people) sort of feel they can move around freely once again,\" Parker said. \"In this particular community I can say I do feel safer over the past year or so.\"\n\nWilmington mayor softens plan to target vacant, blighted properties\n\nThe effort in West Center City includes plans to rid the neighborhood of blighted properties, to clean up streets and common areas and to engage nonprofits and residents in a way that offers them ownership.\n\n\"Has everything we wanted to see been addressed? No. But we're working toward that,\" Turner said. \"People are coming to the table.\"\n\nPurzycki said crosswalks are being painted, city inspectors are visiting long neglected properties, the parks are clean and the community center is in better shape than before.\n\n\"You just get an overall sense that the community is better,\" Purzycki said.\n\nThe mayor said he expects to soon rehabilitate of some of the 27 homes and two liquor stores the city acquired in West Center City.\n\n\"That's when you're going to see a big change,\" Purzyacki said.\n\nPurzycki expects to soon announce the second Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Which neighborhood will get that special attention is still a secret, he said.\n\n\"People are maybe a little frustrated that the investment that goes on in other parts of the city hasn't reached their neighborhoods yet. I think that's a fair criticism,\" he said. \"In spite of that, people believe we are working very hard to improve the neighborhoods.\"\n\nIt is shootings that color Watson's perception of the safety of her city. Few people have forgotten the moniker Murder Town USA, Newsweek's infamous Wilmington headline.\n\n\"One of the older gentlemen around my age got shot up,\" Watson said. \"You kind of know the areas to stay away, which is so sad. I'm shocked you said it crime went down.\"\n\nBut they have: in Watson's and surrounding neighborhood, by more than half.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nWilmington Police Department CompStat numbers are publicly available.

Tattnall St. is outfitted with dozens of tools ranging from bandsaws and lathes to laser engravers with a retail price that would rival most luxury cars.\n\nIn exchange for a monthly membership fee, anyone can gain access to the equipment, along with classes on how they can be used to make your own coffee table, fidget spinner or Father's Day nightlight.\n\nBut the biggest project for NextFab may be to help rebuild the city it now calls home.\n\nLocated in a neighborhood marked by blight and violence, the company is being looked to as a linchpin for Mayor Mike Purzycki's effort to \"stabilize\" West Center City, the Wilmington Renaissance Corp.'s long-running attempt to build a thriving Creative District and even Gov. John Carney's vision for an entrepreneurial economy.\n\nThe company's ability to assist with those efforts helped NextFab land a $350,000 taxpayer grant from the Delaware Economic Development Office in late 2015 – funding that was contingent on its ability to open a Wilmington location and maintain 120 members for three years.\n\n\"Sure, there's a certain amount of pressure to perform,\" NextFab President Evan Malone said Wednesday.\n\n\"But I think people want us to succeed,\" he said. \"We're good at what we do, and there will be real economic activity that comes out of this, so I'm not too worried.\"\n\nMalone first launched NextFab in West Philadelphia amid the Great Recession. The company not only survived the economic downturn but eventually flourished and now occupies two locations in the City of Brotherly Love with 700 members between them.\n\nCarrie Gray, the Wilmington Renaissance Corp.'s managing director, said she first toured NextFab in 2013 and immediately saw its potential for the Wilmington Creative District, a public-private partnership then in its infancy.\n\n\"Little did (Evan) know the courtship, and frankly stalking, that would begin,\" she said.\n\nToday, the Creative District includes a handful of murals, a public arts garden and the first of what will be 12 homes at Fourth and Washington streets built by Interfaith Community Housing and marketed to artists and makers.\n\nBarrel of Makers – the city's first organized collective of painters, woodworkers, glass blowers, engineers, computer programmers and 3-D printer builders – also has been offering programs at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center on Madison Street.\n\nGray said the goal is to eventually seed an artists' colony from West Center City to Market Street, anchored by sites such as NextFab.\n\n\"Having something like Nextfab really helps to round out our ecosystem here in Wilmington,\" she said. \"We see this as a huge step forward.\"\n\nMalone said he had hoped for NextFab to arrive earlier, but the arrival was delayed by the process of selecting the right location. An initial 3,500-square-foot site at Eighth and West streets was abandoned in favor of the current site – a long-vacant photography studio with considerably more space.\n\nNextFab was worth the wait, said Purzycki, who hailed the business as a magnet for young people looking to \"exercise their creative ability and enjoy Wilmington.\"\n\nThe neighborhood has been a magnet for violence. The four-block radius around NextFab's new location has been the site of seven shootings in 2017, including two homicides.\n\n\"We're going to have lots of flood lighting and security cameras outside,\" Malone said. \"We've also got a buddy system worked out to be sure our customers and safe are not leaving in the evening hours without supervision.\"\n\nThe company's arrival also comes less than a month after the mayor unveiled his \"neighborhood stabilization program\" for West Center Center, which he promised would include a greater police presence, increased trash pickup and a crackdown on nuisance properties.\n\n\"We are going to build this community and make this community safe,\" Purzycki said during a ribbon-cutting for the business on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that the redevelopment effort also would require jobs, and with them, an effort to provide job skills to community residents – skills they can now learn at NextFab.\n\n\"Your city stands ready to embrace you,\" Purzycki told the business. \"We're thrilled to have you.\"\n\nYet some residents, such as Amira Idris, are hoping NextFab can help provide them with more than a job. She's hoping it helps her build a company.\n\nAfter earning a master's degree in entrepreneurship from the University of Delaware last year, the 24-year-old founder of Vibrating Therapeutic Apparel was accepted into a 12-week business accelerator program at NextFab in Philadelphia, a crash course in product development that also came with a $25,000 investment.\n\nThis month, she signed on to be the first tenant in one of the half-dozen office spaces on the second floor of NextFab's new Wilmington location. There, she hopes to turn her design for a sleeve that relieves phantom limb pain into a final product.\n\n\"NextFab has been so wonderful in moving my company along, but I was getting tired of commuting to Philly,\" she said. \"I'm so glad these resources are now available a little closer to home.\"\n\nCarney said he hopes other entrepreneurs from the University of Delaware make a similar to move to Wilmington, either to NextFab or one of the city's co-working spaces.\n\n\"The point of all this is to bring young folks into our city, to bring their talents and cultivate them so they stay here and help us grow our city in very positive ways,\" he said. \"I couldn't be more excited.\"\n\nAviles, the co-founder of the artist co-working space Artist Ave Station at Eighth and Tatnall streets, said his excitement is a little different – perhaps even verging on nervousness.\n\n\"I'm actually not a builder,\" he said, despite having landed a free two-month membership.\n\n\"I'm kind of like intimidated slightly by it,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I'm excited because I know I'm about to learn and NextFab is going to teach me.\"\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2019/09/23/gun-violence-wilmington-routine-some-residents-fed-up/2361969001/", "title": "Gun violence in Wilmington is routine.

Deloras Alexander, who grew up in the Southbridge area, wasn't surprised that people who grow up there tend to get stuck.\n\nShe was standing near a group of benches on the corner of A Street surrounded by planters and trees — a \"park.\" Across the street is Dugan's Liquors, a corner store with security bars over the windows and trash on the sidewalk.\n\nSeveral houses on the street are boarded up and vacant. Elbert-Palmer Elementary School, about a block away, is frequently plagued by adults who stand outside and drink.\n\nPoverty and social mobility: Interactive map shows how Delaware neighborhoods fare\n\n\"We used to have community centers,\" Alexander said. \"We had things to do after school.\"\n\nNow, she said, she doesn't even want her grandkids going to their feeder school. Instead, they go to Odyssey Charter. There, her 5-year-old grandson is learning Greek, Alexander said. He worries about his grandma and wishes she were better off.\n\n\"That's my little man,\" Alexander said, recalling how the little boy recently said to her: \"Nana, I have some money here to help you pay some bills.\"\n\n\"I told him to keep it,\" she said.\n\nBehind her, another Southbridge resident shook her head in disgust.\n\n\"I'm not poor,\" she said, upset that anyone would even insinuate Southbridge residents are.\n\nAnd she's right. Not everyone in Southbridge is considered low-income. About 30 percent are; some parts of Wilmington are closer to 50 percent.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki said the city has taken steps toward improving economic mobility in Wilmington as a whole. For two years now, it has held a Historically Black Colleges and Universities fair for local high-schoolers, connecting nearly 250 students them with more than $1 million in scholarships this year, he said.\n\nADDING JOBS AND REDUCING BLIGHT\n\nPurzycki unveilsplan to 'stabilize' Wilmington's West Center City\n\n76ers, developer team up to build Wilmington arena\n\nWilmington student getsfull ride in less than 20 minutes\n\nPrivatizing the Port of Wilmington will create good-paying blue collar jobs for city residents, he added, while the new 76ers Fieldhouse has created \"hundreds of new construction jobs.\" He also talked about efforts to draw new businesses to the downtown and the Riverfront.\n\n\"We are also making progress in the area of neighborhood stabilization — reducing crime and attacking blight — first in West Center City and then on to other distressed neighborhoods,\" Purzycki said in a written statement. \"This effort will pay dividends in the long-term as well as the short-term because a stable place to live is tied directly to a person’s ability to achieve employment and prosperity.\"\n\nRead Mayor Mike Purzycki's full statement at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhen you first open the new U.S. Census tool, known as \"The Opportunity Atlas,\" it's hard to tell what you're looking at. It's a massive map, with splotches of blue, green, yellow, orange and red.\n\nWhen you zoom in, you're looking at household income for people born between 1978 and 1983 to low-income parents in the United States.\n\nIn areas that are more red, people who grew up poor tended to stay poor. In areas that are more blue, people who grew up in low-income households are making more money than their parents did.\n\nIsn't that the definition of the American Dream? Being able to achieve upward social mobility through hard work, determination and initiative?\n\nYeah, 48-year-old Keysha Peak nodded.\n\nShe lives in Southbridge, too, which stretches from South Market Street to the Port of Wilmington. According to the Opportunity Atlas, the average 2014-15 income for children born in that area, who are now in their mid-30s, is only $14,000.\n\nIn other parts of the city, it ranges from $15,000 to $32,000. If you exclude Highlands and Trolley Square, the highest average household income for the group drops to $26,000 in Canby Park.\n\nAbout 60 percent of residents who live in Southbridge are employed. About 86 percent of those are from low-income families who have never left Wilmington and 81 percent are minorities, according to the Opportunity Atlas.\n\nNowhere else in Delaware is there so little economic mobility. It's hard to find many places in the United States where those who grew up in low-income families are making as little as $14,000 a year.\n\nOne place is Bethel, Alaska, a rural community with fewer than 6,100 residents. Another is the north side of Pittsburgh. Salaries don't fall that low in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., or Detroit, though they come close.\n\nDepending on the size of individual households, that could translate into living below the poverty line. The federal poverty level for an individual living in the United States is currently $12,140. For a family of four, it's $25,100.\n\nPeak, said: \"It seems that people who grow up here get stuck here.\"\n\nShe was standing in front of her great-grandmother's house on South Claymont Street. Now her mom lives there, she said.\n\nPeak left Wilmington for a while but just moved back, into a house across the street.\n\n\"It's funny that I'm right back here,\" she said. \"Nothing's changed.\"\n\nA lot of the people she went to high school with still live in Southbridge, though some have become addicted to drugs and some have died. Many community members also abuse alcohol, she said.\n\nPeak, whose 8-year-old son goes to Elbert Palmer, hopes she can move back out of the neighborhood soon, in part because her son is afraid to go outside or play at the park and has gained 30 pounds due to the lack of exercise.\n\n\"These kids, it's horrible in this neighborhood,\" she said. \"They break bottles and curse.\"\n\nCynthia Williams, youth coordinator at the Neighborhood House on B Street, described a neighborhood where few families ever leave. Residents tend to own houses instead of rent and pass property down to their children.\n\nReal estate listings show that houses in the neighborhood are valued fairly low or are in pre-foreclosure, which would make it difficult to sell them and get enough money for a new one.\n\nThe Neighborhood House has before- and after-school programs and serves about 40 kids at a time. Joanne Parker-Henry, the programs' supervisor, said things are bad all over and refused to condemn Southbridge as a bad place to live.\n\nIf she thought in terms of how much better children were doing than their parents \"I couldn't be here,\" she said.\n\nParker-Henry said her staff instead focuses on helping children realize their dreams.\n\n\"If you have somebody that inspires you to do better, you can get out,\" she said. \"That's why we're here.\"\n\nThe Southbridge Civic Association holds events, like Southbridge Weekend, with fun activities for residents of all ages. It was canceled this year due to bad weather, but organizers said on Facebook that they hope to bring it back next summer with a full week of fun events.\n\nLeslie Newman, CEO of the Delaware nonprofit Children and Families First, suggested an approach similar that being taken in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nA task force there has identified early childhood development, college and career readiness, family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility, according to National Public Radio.\n\nMecklenburg County, where the city is located, has committed to providing pre-K for all children. The city has a $50 million bond issue for affordable housing on the November ballot, and matching private donations could boost the total to over $100 million.\n\n\"We need to follow Charlotte’s example of coming together,\" Newman said, also stressing the value of parent-child relationships.\n\nChildren and Families First has several programs for new parents and families, which focus on developing healthy habits during and post pregnancy, positive parenting skills, building community schools, financial literacy and more.\n\n“I believe that the secret sauce is the two-gen approach,\" Newman said. \"It’s the family and the children. We have to have parents be successful, and we have to have kids be successful and we have to help forge the bond between the two.”\n\nThe idea is to counteract the effects of so-called adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse, mental illness, domestic violence, divorce, physical and emotional neglect and more. There are also adverse community environments, such as poverty, discrimination, poor housing, violence and others that can have huge impacts on children's future health and well-being.\n\nEven if you have a good home life, you can be impacted by toxic stressors in your community, Newman said.\n\n“We now know that those negative experiences can impact your brain, how your brain looks,\" she said, describing how some children have trouble as adults trusting and bonding with people. That, in turn, weakens their ability to meet goals, hold down a job, regulate their emotions and more.\n\n“Their brain development is different than a child that lives in circumstances that don’t have that toxic stress.”\n\nMORE FROM DELAWAREONLINE\n\nNew Delaware restaurants: Lots coming in fall 2018 and later\n\nGeorge Thorogood cancels next week's sold out Grand show\n\nWilmington council email: What can 'be done' about president's parking ticket?\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Cries for justice go unanswered.\n\nThe constant crackle of gunfire makes longtime residents feel as if the city has abandoned them. Yet some teens act as if it can't touch them.\n\n\"There are only two roads that this (violence) leads to — death and prison,\" said the Rev. Donald Morton, a Wilmington pastor and executive director of the Complexities of Color Coalition, a grassroots effort to address racial oppression. \"And both of those roads, the young people are not afraid of. It just doesn't matter to them anymore.\"\n\nAbout 41,000 of Wilmington's nearly 72,000 residents are African-American, as are most suspects and victims of gun violence. At the end of August, 43 of the last 50 homicide victims in the city were black.\n\nMorton and others said political, religious and law enforcement leaders must own the ongoing bloodbath — and plot a course to correct it.\n\n\"The failure is ours,\" added Morton, pastor of the Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Church, \"on individuals that have let this go too long hoping this would self-correct.”\n\nIn 2013, Wilmington City Councilwoman Hanifa Shabazz asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study gun violence as a public health epidemic – a new undertaking for the agency, which normally uses its investigative teams to determine whether environmental factors are causing health issues such as cancer clusters.\n\nThe CDC provided Wilmington with a one-of-a-kind prescription to quell the shootings in its 2015 report, noting that Delaware's largest city experienced \"epidemic levels of urban gun violence.\"\n\nBut no local or state dollars have been allocated to implement the key component of the CDC roadmap: Use data such as truancy records, emergency room visits and domestic abuse allegations to identify at-risk children, and intervene in their lives early — while in elementary and middle school — when the information signals a potentially life-alerting alarm.\n\nInteractive Map:Explore Wilmington shootings\n\nThe CDC also said Delaware must provide these children with life-skills programs and relationships to serve as a foundation for their future. Mentorships and smart programming could help more children turn their lives around, stay out of prison and survive, the agency said.\n\nNo money was allocated by former Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams or former Gov. Jack Markell. And newly elected leaders Mayor Mike Purzycki and Gov. John Carney have yet to put any money behind the CDC's data-focused road map.\n\nIn interviews with The News Journal, Carney acknowledged that the data plan was a state responsibility, but said he would not allocate more state dollars for the city until he was assured all expenditures were being used wisely.\n\nDr. Kara Odom Walker, secretary of the state Department of Health and Social Services, estimated that the CDC plan would cost about $1 million to $2 million annually, but offered no real timeline on how soon it could be put into practice.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilmington witnessed 140 people shot by the end of August — an average of four per week in what may be a record year for bloodshed. In 2013, the year Shabazz was moved to request CDC help, shootings peaked at 154 for the whole year — the city's standing record.\n\n“The CDC gave us a preventative intervention,” said Rita Landgraf, former secretary of the state Department of Health and Social Services who is still working on the CDC plan. “If we were going to remain true to that model, then we would have to be able to look at this data … (and) reach those children identified by the data.”\n\nIn 2016, the Markell administration named 25 community members and local leaders to a CDC Community Advisory Council tasked with developing a plan for implementing the CDC's recommendation. The council, led by Shabazz, now president of Wilmington City Council, spent almost a year compiling its own 51-page \"Call to Action\" report focused on its own recommendations for services to reduce youth violence.\n\nThe Delaware report agreed that the city should gather data on at-risk children, but it didn't say where it would find the money, people or software to make it happen.\n\nThere's also a legal hurdle to clear: To build the kind of profile the CDC recommended, government agencies and private aid organizations would need to combine a wealth of information. That requires a workaround of federal and state privacy laws, officials said.\n\n“We couldn’t get around the first hurdle,” said Henry Smith, co-chair of the CDC Community Advisory Council created to implement the plan. Delaware lawyers are working to resolve the legal issues, he said.\n\nYet data aggregation is not as difficult as Delaware is making it, said CDC researcher Steven Sumner.\n\nLast year, he mapped the lives of 421 Wilmington residents arrested for gun crimes between 2009 and 2014, using the same data the state is having trouble obtaining and sharing. He released his findings to demonstrate that identifying at-risk youth is doable using the CDC’s method.\n\nWilmington also contacted Allegheny County, Pennsylvania — an area encompassing Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs — to see how another metropolitan area overcame the obstacles. While the purpose of Allegheny's data warehouse is different — to help social workers see the complete picture of the families they serve — the bedrock hardware would be similar.\n\nIt cost Allegheny County $2.5 million to create a data warehouse in 1999 and another $1.8 million a year to pay staff and maintain the strategy. The price tag could be far less for Wilmington, which has only 5 percent of the population Allegheny serves.\n\n“They (Delaware) can buy the technology and analytics,” said Erin Dalton, a deputy director for the Allegheny office of data analysis, research and evaluation. \"They can’t buy the political will.”\n\nThis year, the CDC advisory council focused on strengthening existing programs targeting city youth, and on new training for community center staff to recognize trauma.\n\n“This is not going to be done overnight,” Shabazz said. “I think our progress is tremendous.”\n\nThe advisory council has been meeting regularly since the spring to identify which youth programs are effective and where they can share resources between government and nonprofit agencies, she said.\n\n\"You've never seen such a collaboration to address one issue, ever,\" Shabazz said.\n\nStill, the violence — largely perpetrated by teen gangs — pushed Delaware's largest city to the most dangerous place in America for kids ages 12 to 17, according to an analysis of Gun Violence Archive per capita data by The News Journal, USA TODAY and the Associated Press.\n\nToday, the situation for teens in Wilmington is actually worse than when the CDC was called.\n\nThe last juvenile to lose her life was 16-year-old Tynesia Cephas, gunned down while trying to break up a fight on Wilmington's East Side. Her boyfriend and his family watched as she took her last breath on a row home floor after being shot on Kirkwood Street.\n\n“It’s like death don’t have an age right now, and bullets damn don’t have a name,” said Tyzell Cephas, the girl's 23-year-old brother.\n\nOn the same day Cephas died, Delaware State Police Cpl. Stephen Ballard was killed in a Wawa parking lot in the unincorporated community of Bear. The state immediately rallied behind law enforcement and was transfixed on the search for Ballard's killer, who barricaded himself inside his family's Middletown home with scores of police officers outside.\n\nThe siege ended 21 hours later when 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr. was shot dead after an armored tank began disassembling his family's home.\n\nWeeks later, Ballard's wife, Louise, told those gathered at a CDC Community Advisory Council meeting that her husband would want his death to spur change — not just for his family, but for those suffering from violence statewide.\n\n“My daughter and I are going to be OK, but this community is struggling,” she said at the gathering in Wilmington. \"I have the entire state at my fingertips right now. I’ll hold them (accountable) to put the money where their mouth is and cause action. … That’s what my husband would want.”\n\nCephas’ death drew much less attention. Her killer has not been found, even though the shooter fired among a large crowd.\n\nFor many, the killing made April 26 just another day on the city’s streets.\n\nPurzycki and other local leaders stopped by the service at Ezion Fair Baptist Church where Cephas was laid to rest in a gold-trimmed white casket weeks after her death. Trophies marking her achievements for baseball and the Juneteenth Pageant glimmered next to her coffin, adorned with red and white flowers.\n\n“The mayor shook hands, said, ‘I’m sorry for your loss,’” recalled Cephas' brother, Tyzell. “And that’s nice, but I wanna know what paperwork y’all getting ready to file to get this thing rolling … to make sure this never happens again.”\n\nBeing raised in a neighborhood racked with poverty, where shootings and drug dealing are an everyday occurrence, and where liquor stores vastly outnumber grocery stores, puts a child at an obvious disadvantage, the CDC said in its report on Wilmington.\n\nEach time a child visits a community center, attends school or gets a summer job, his or her chances at a more stable, successful life improves, according to the CDC.\n\nConversely, each run-in with the law, each act of violence witnessed, makes it more difficult to reach the child before he becomes a victim of, or engages in, crime that forever alters his future, said the CDC, which has examined only Wilmington's gun violence epidemic among America's cities.\n\nWere the CDC plan implemented, each negative life event would be assigned a score. And if a child's score reached a tipping point, an intervention could be made when the state is called to a child’s home to investigate a report of abuse, when a teenager is arrested, when a student confides in his teacher about a sibling being shot, or when a parent files for unemployment benefits.\n\nIt begins with reaching Wilmington teens like a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old, who agreed to speak to The News Journal on the condition that they not be identified — because speaking about the streets, even for those outside of the gang life, could get one killed.\n\nIf the CDC plan was in place, these young men may have racked up a high number of points purely because of the ZIP code in which they lived and their life experiences.\n\nThe 19-year-old recalls living in Philadelphia’s public housing as a child, while his mother worked two jobs and went to school. His grandmother, who was supposed to be watching him and his siblings, was too strung out on drugs to care for the children, he said.\n\n“I was 9 years old, walking outside to figure out how to get money to feed me, my little brother, and my baby sister,” he said, tears rolling down his cheeks.\n\nA few years later, his mother moved the family to Wilmington to get away from violence and poverty. But life here was no different. In Wilmington, the teen said, he was beaten up his first week of sixth grade.\n\nHe was on his way to the cafeteria when a group of classmates punched him repeatedly over a rumor swirling about a girl. He said he sat alone in the lunch room, afraid to tell teachers what had happened.\n\nIt was a middle school lesson in the city's no-snitch code — and a reminder that “keeping your head up” to look tough is important in dangerous situations.\n\nThe experience made the teen angry – angry enough to join a group of kids he felt could ensure he'd never be beaten up again. His new friendships frightened his mom, who worried the relationships would endanger her other children.\n\nThe boy's mother ultimately kicked the teen out of the house. With no place to go, he said he began sleeping in a park. Without a cellphone, it took him weeks to learn his best friend had been caught carrying a gun and was sent to prison.\n\nThat ended the 19-year-old's dream of walking through high school graduation with his friend. But he did walk across the stage alone, and today he has a diploma and a part-time job.\n\nAnother 17-year-old Wilmington boy who hopes to be the first person in his family to graduate high school also wanted to walk at graduation with his best friend — but his friend was killed by gun violence. And months later, his brother was gunned down on Wilmington’s streets.\n\nHe had a searing urge for revenge.\n\n“It makes you want to go out and do something reckless,\" he said. \"But I got a mom here. I got people I’ve got to take care of. It hurts every day, looking at them and knowing my brother is never coming home.”\n\nHad the CDC plan been in place, a caseworker would have intervened in the 19-year-old's life when he got kicked out of his house or beaten up at school. The 17-year-old could have gotten therapy after losing his friend and his brother.\n\nBoth boys are determined to get out of Wilmington. Otherwise, they fear they will be pulled into a way of life they want to avoid.\n\n“I'm not about to sit here and be another statistic,” the 19-year-old said.\n\nAdded the 17-year-old: “It’s not as easy as everybody thinks it is.”\n\nWith no government funding in sight for intervention suggested by the CDC, Shabazz’s strategy is to “re-appropriate dollars” from treatment programs to jump-start the roadmap suggested by the federal agency.\n\nShe believes shifting existing dollars toward younger children who have yet to be exposed to trauma would be more successful than trying to change the lives of adults who've already established long criminal histories. But she wouldn’t specify which treatment programs would be cut.\n\nThe CDC advisory council earlier this year discussed launching a \"Summer for Success Campaign,\" which council members said would include rallies to kick off programs and free bus passes for youth to get to recreation centers. Those ideas did not come to fruition.\n\nInstead, the advisory council backed already-existing community centers — dubbed \"Safe Havens\" for the program — and their extended summer hours. The group also endorsed summer learning programs for low-income kids, and trained community center staff in early June on recognizing the signs of children experiencing trauma.\n\nThe city renewed its annual program to hire 450 youth for summer jobs at day camps, landscaping businesses and office buildings. Shabazz believed these efforts would help curb teen violence in the city while kids are out of school. Still, five kids under the age of 18 were shot from June through August.\n\nOthers on the CDC council have created a plan to link four city schools with community health and social services in New Castle County. The pilot program, modeled after Boston-based City Connects, uses software to create a profile for each student so that the child can continue to receive services even if they transfer between schools and districts.\n\nIt could have begun this fall, but it received no state funding.\n\nTraining coordinators at each school would cost an estimated $100,000 for the first year, said Matt Swanson, executive chairman of Innovative Schools, an organization that supports new efforts in educating Delaware children. After two years of training staff, it would require just $3,000 to sustain, he said.\n\n\"You can really lose a kid when a family gets displaced in the middle of a school year,\" Swanson said. \"Services that they may have found, they may lose when they transfer schools.\"\n\nOther projects that have been discussed include a youth wellness center modeled after a city re-entry program, and an alternative school suspension program. Many of these efforts require funding, which has yet to be secured.\n\n“We’re still throwing stuff against the wall, and seeing what sticks,” said Parks and Recreation Director Kevin F. Kelley Sr.\n\nOn top of looking at programs for youth, Purzycki announced in May a “neighborhood stabilization program” he hopes will turn around the city’s roughest neighborhoods with greater police presence, increased trash pickup, and a crackdown on liquor stores and nuisance properties.\n\nThe first neighborhood focus is West Center City, the historic zone from Adams to Tatnall streets, and Fourth to 10th streets.\n\nFew places need help more. Not only is West Center City one of the most violent areas, more than 1 in 10 properties are registered as vacant, and property owners owe the city $1.8 million in unpaid taxes.\n\nRevitalizing the area could have an impact because it is adjacent to the city’s downtown business district and sits against I-95. But similar West Center City efforts dating back to the 1960s have failed to create sustainable change.\n\nMeanwhile, Delaware Attorney Matt Denn pledged $900,000 through the Neighborhood Building Blocks Fund to after-school and summer programs targeting Delaware youth. These efforts include a soccer league for teens in Wilmington's Hilltop neighborhood and a stipend for teens who pick up trash and paint positive messages on boards covering windows of abandoned buildings in West Center City.\n\nAnd Carney re-established the Family Services Cabinet Council to break down silos that can separate state programs, such as job training, early childhood education, substance abuse treatment and affordable housing.\n\nYet many caution that while these types of revitalization efforts sound good, agency collaborations and youth programs are useless if the city and state aren’t capable of identifying which children and homes need services the most.\n\n“I’m worried about the kids that aren’t coming [to community centers],” said Paul Calistro, the director of the West End Neighborhood House, a nonprofit in Wilmington’s Little Italy neighborhood. “I’m worried about the corner kids.”\n\nMost kids in the city rarely see run-ins with police as positive, said newly appointed Wilmington police Chief Robert Tracy. He hopes to change that by bringing to Wilmington the Group Violence Intervention strategy used in cities like Chicago and New York.\n\nIn reality, only about one-half of 1 percent of Wilmington's population is responsible for the city's gun violence, said David Kennedy, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Instead of characterizing these impoverished neighborhoods as violent places dominated by bad people, police need to recognize that many good people live in these communities, said Kennedy, who is helping Tracy implement a new policing strategy.\n\n\"What we should recognize about the rest of them is they were born into communities that have historically been treated in ways that have done them incredible damage,\" Kennedy said.\n\nIn Chicago, Tracy used “gang call-ins” to bring together troublemakers and let them hear directly from the people they were hurting: business leaders unable to make money, family members mourning the loss of loved ones and hardworking citizens just trying to scratch out a living.\n\nThese meetings served as opportunities for police and social workers to connect with the people that needed them most, Tracy said. If a man said he couldn’t get a job because he didn’t have job training, services were made available. When a woman said she lacked a photo ID, social workers jumped in to fix the problem.\n\nAnd if the people ignored these opportunities and continued to commit crimes, police pursued arrests. It could be effective in tamping down Wilmington's gang war, the chief said.\n\n\"What we want you to do is stay away from the violence, put the guns down, share the message with the people you're with,” Tracy said, “because if the person that commits the crime is someone who is connected to you in some way ... (and) associated with a gang, you're all now responsible.\"\n\nState prosecutors use a similar approach to hold gang members accountable for the crimes of associates. They used Delaware's gang participation statute in last year’s broad indictment against 29 members of the Only My Brothers gang.\n\nIt's an effective tool to get gang members off the streets, said members of the Violent Criminal Enterprises Unit, created by the Attorney General’s Office in August.\n\n\"That is the most bang for your buck,\" said Deputy Attorney General Joseph Grubb. \"That is the way to make the streets the most safe, from a prosecutorial angle.\"\n\nThe city does not have a gang unit, however. And Wilmington police Master Sgt. William Schmid wonders if it would benefit from one.\n\n\"It's like addiction,\" said Schmid, who has spent years attending trainings on gang activity. \"Until we all acknowledge it and say the four-letter word, gang, it's not going to get better. So let's just accept it and figure out a way to address it.\"\n\nMany of the city's teens have lost connection with African-American churches that long served as the foundation for Wilmington communities, the Rev. Morton said.\n\nThe disconnect has left them without a sense of culture, heritage and values, said Morton, who recalled the programs that fostered his growth as a young man in Wilmington. Until church services and programs become \"sexy enough\" to get youth through the doors, Morton said the community should not be surprised by the violent ways city youth choose to express themselves.\n\n“Half the time, these kids’ first time in a church is at a funeral,” said Tynesia Cephas’ cousin, Laqueen McDuffie.\n\nAt Cephas' funeral, the Rev. Lester Justice urged children to speak out against violence in Wilmington’s streets.\n\n\"When we hear about things that are about to occur, we have to come together and say, 'We're not about that life,'\" Justice said. \"Whether it's at school, at home, in the neighborhood, in the community, we have to say, 'I have a foundation. I want to do better than this.'\"\n\nTeens need guidance to overcome constant exposure to violence, poverty and oppression that began when their ancestors were slaves, Morton said.\n\n\"Anytime someone continues to experience (violence) and nobody's treating it, in the way for almost 400 years we've not been treating it, we're going to continue getting what we're getting,\" Morton said. \"Even the people pulling the trigger are pulling the trigger because of trauma.\"\n\nTracy, state Attorney General Denn and others know that reaching children at the youngest age possible is key to ensuring they never pick up a gun — or end up a victim themselves.\n\n“There’s no age where it’s too young to be thinking about this stuff,” Denn said.\n\nTracy plans to start calling local schools each morning like he did in Chicago to share information on students whose families may have been impacted by gun violence the night before. Doing so in Delaware is harder due to the fragmented school system, he said, but Tracy hopes to overcome that hurdle.\n\nIf nothing is done, community leaders and parents fear teenagers who have already had run-ins with the criminal justice system will constitute another lost generation of young black men.\n\nJahlil Lewis, the 17-year-old who pleaded guilty as part of the Only My Brothers case, was sentenced to two years in prison and is expected to return home before he turns 18.\n\nHis mother, Latisha Jackson, and other parents banded together after their sons were indicted to create a support group called Save Our Sons, and 302 Mothers and Fathers In Action. The parents worry their children will have limited opportunities due to felony gun charges and the no-contact orders put in place to keep them from associating with their childhood friends-turned-accused gang members.\n\nStatistically, the odds are stacked against Jahlil and his friends – because of their age and their criminal records.\n\nA Wilmington teen on community probation is 13 times more likely to be arrested for firearm-related violence than the average child, according to CDC research.\n\nIn a sentencing request this summer for Nakeem Bailey, state prosecutors asked for four years behind bars followed by probation for the 16-year-old’s guilty plea. Already, state prosecutor Mark Denney said in a letter to the judge, six of Bailey’s co-defendants were released from prison — and had again committed more crimes.\n\nBailey also was “among the more brazen OMB members in his display of handguns through photographs and videos,” Denney wrote. These photos depicted Bailey posing with his handgun and pointing it at the camera. Text messages submitted to the judge also show Bailey asking for a $200 handgun with specific requests for the barrel size and magazine capacity.\n\nIn late June, Naseem Parks — who pleaded guilty earlier this year to gang participation and gun possession — was charged again with gang participation and rioting after beating up a known member of the rival Shoot to Kill gang in prison. His additional charges, if found guilty, will tack years onto his sentence.\n\nBut others, like Jahlil, have plans for their futures.\n\nHe told his mom from inside prison that he wants to get his GED, move into his own apartment, work two jobs and buy a car, Latisha Jackson recalled. All of those things would keep him away from the street lifestyle that landed him behind bars.\n\n“One mistake is not his life,” Jackson said. “A lot of (teens) are dying, and I want my kids to live.”\n\nThis yearlong investigative project sought to unravel the driving force behind Wilmington's teen violence, an ongoing plague in the city considered most dangerous for children in all of America. Journalists spent more than a year interviewing both the teens affected by the violence and those charged with committing these crimes, state prosecutors, police officers, community members and family members. Reporters attended funerals of children lost to the violence, community meetings and rallies condemning the gunfire, and court hearings of teens and young adults charged with gun violence. Journalists also pored over thousands of pages of court documents, data requests and social media posts to re-create a full account of what prompted a teenage gang war to break out in Delaware's largest city.

There was a time someone discarded the remnants of a foreclosed house and there were always mounds of tires greeting worshippers on their way to God's house.\n\n\"Nobody wants to be around when there's trash,\" Weeks said. \"You don't feel at ease and you certainly don't feel like someone is paying attention. So it's very discouraging as we're trying to get people involved.\"\n\nRecently, Weeks said he's noticed a reduction in the amount of trash around the church and the neighborhood. He attributes it to a partnership with Wilmington officials, especially city police Patrolman Nick Kroll, who since December has been stepping up efforts to stop much of the blight he comes across.\n\nKroll said when he joined the department about four years ago he was all about catching bad guys and dealing with the drugs and guns plaguing some of the city's neighborhoods. But as time went on, he noticed that the trash, which affects everyone's quality of life, was not being addressed.\n\n\"For me, it was just exhausting to see and frustrating,\" said Kroll, assigned to Wilmington's northeast part of town. \"While there are a lot of other things going on in the city, this is important from a quality of life and a financial standpoint.\"\n\n\"It was just so gross and overdone,\" he said.\n\nSTORY: Purzycki unveils plan to 'stabilize' Wilmington's West Center City\n\nSTORY: 10-11 tons of trash removed from Delaware beaches every day\n\nKroll partnered with the city's Department of Public Works in going after people illegally dumping in these communities. This partnership has allowed the city to file criminal charges against many of them.\n\nBefore Kroll got involved, illegal dumping usually resulted in a $50 fine – if the perpetrators were caught. The low fine emboldened some to risk getting caught dumping, rather than paying the landfill fee, which can start at $85 per ton for people without a discount disposal fee.\n\nKroll knows this because of what he was nonchalantly told by people he arrested.\n\n\"Probably half of them said, 'Well everyone else is doing it there,' \" Kroll said.\n\n\"The chances of them getting identified and picked up before we started this investigation was slim to none,\" he said. \"So you had these contractors rolling the dice and they just back up and unload their trucks.\"\n\nKroll not only brings his investigative skills to these matters, he's able to file criminal charges that carry stiffer penalties, including having illegal dumpers reimburse what it costs Wilmington to clean up their messes.\n\nDuring two recent clean-ups on Hay Road, the city collected about 140 tons of trash and debris. That clean-up cost Wilmington about $86,000 to dispose of in the landfill – not including the man hours or the costs of equipment.\n\nSo far, Kroll has arrested 20 people and one of the things he found interesting was that 17 don't live in the city.\n\n\"Officer Kroll has tackled an ongoing illegal activity in our city that is traditionally hard to control,\" Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki said. \"We have to work hard to keep our city clean and beautiful. And as the officer's outstanding work confirms, the majority of those who dump trash in our city, don’t live in our city.\n\n\"We are striving for excellence in public service in Wilmington and Officer Kroll, with the support of staff from city public works department, exemplifies how to get things done effectively,\" said Purzycki.\n\nThe mayor thanked Kroll \"for sending a message to would-be violators that Wilmington is a lot smarter than they are and we'll arrest and prosecute them if they trash our city.\"\n\nPublic works officials said they are seeing less littering in some of these areas.\n\n\"The kid is just doing a great job with it,\" said Marlyn W. Dietz, Wilmington's public works director of operations.\n\nDietz said Kroll's efforts have been contagious.\n\n\"At first, the other officers were busting on him, calling him the 'trash police,' \" Dietz said. \"But once they started seeing that he was making some headway, they started giving him information. So it's kind of been like a snowball growing.\"\n\nKroll effort started at a time Dietz was trying to get more help in controlling the problem himself. Dietz bought more cameras to catch people dumping trash and enlisted the help of state parks officials to show him how to set up the cameras.\n\nDietz, a former city police officer with more than 30 years on the force, said he'd like to have Kroll assigned exclusively to this.\n\n\"His enthusiasm is energizing to see it because it makes us want to do more now,\" he said. \"It makes me want to get more cameras. It makes me want to try and get him here on a more permanent basis.\"\n\nWilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said the department is committed to working in conjunction with other city departments to help increase the quality of life within of residents.\n\n\"Throughout numerous geographical areas of the city, citizens complaints have been made known to us in reference to illegal dumping incidents,\" Tracy said. \"Officer Kroll of our Uniform Services Division has been an integral part of an initiative to investigate and arrest those individuals who use our city as a dumping ground, the vast majority identified thus far don't even reside in our city.\"\n\nTracy said the department will continue to communicate with Wilmington residents and businesses to address these types of issues, adding that police are a key factor in the city's revitalization efforts.\n\n\"The community is and will continue to be an integral part of our policing initiative success,\" he added.\n\nWhile Weeks has not met Kroll, he had nothing but praise for the officer's work to improve the community's quality of life.\n\n\"People may not know him personally and pat him on the back, but his work speaks for him,\" Weeks said, adding it encourage others to get involved and better care for their community. \"That's what needs to happen throughout the whole city, is that we see police officers take a real interest in the community. It helps fortify where people are at.\"\n\n\"Once people see they have partners in this, they step up to the plate,\" he said. \"In a lot of neighborhoods, people are willing to step up to the plate.

Working with the help of her family, she's been able to pay her bills, but now she wants to grow her business.\n\nMorales is one of two dozen students who have been taking classes through Launcher, a new entrepreneurship initiative started by West End Neighborhood House. Each week for 12 weeks, students hoping to start, expand or stabilize their businesses meet for workshops in topics like financial planning, marketing and business law.\n\n\"I don't want someone to just have a certificate,\" said Michael McCafferty, the program director. \"I want them to have businesses.\"\n\nTo do that, the students – half in Wilmington, half in Claymont – will get continued support. After graduation this month, they will have access to topic-specific workshops taught by local experts, loans and credit options from the Community Development Financial Institution and a business incubator with shared office space to cut costs and facilitate collaboration.\n\nParticipation was free for students, thanks to a $900,000 contribution from Barclays, which will fund three years of the program. The only requirement is that they either live or open businesses in their Launcher community, either on the west side of Wilmington or in Claymont.\n\nThe program's goal is to launch 40 businesses and create 150 jobs in three years. Some of those new businesses could help occupy some of the 1,500 vacant buildings in Wilmington.\n\n\"When someone starts a business in the neighborhood, they’re going hire in the neighborhood,\" McCafferty said. \"The idea is that you prop up those communities with small businesses.\"\n\nA proven method\n\nThe Launcher program uses a blueprint formulated in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the 1990s. At the time, businesses were suffering, and wooden boards covered up former bakeries, law offices and markets. Officials realized the traditional method of asking established businesses to fill vacancies wasn’t working, said Mihailo Temali, founder of the Neighborhood Development Corp. in St. Paul.\n\n\"These neighborhoods had a reputation of being old, dying and dangerous,\" Temali said. \"It didn’t have the space or appearance that successful businesses wanted anything to do with.\"\n\nTemali and his colleagues had a “light bulb moment\": There were already hundreds, if not thousands, of people in those neighborhoods running small-scale businesses often without the business plan, financing and connections it took to \"bring the business above ground.\" Revitalization, they realized, is less likely to come from an outside corporate savior than from an investment in the people already there.\n\n\"And that had to start with education,\" Temali said.\n\nThey started hosting training classes to help entrepreneurs write business plans. The classes were hosted in the community and were taught by local business owners the students already knew and trusted.\n\n\"Getting into business is a frightening thing for anybody who has half a brain,\" Temali said. \"If you’re not from a family or community that has experience doing that, it's very unnerving. To do it in a small group with folks from your own community, and you’ve got a trainer from that community that’ll guide you, that’s a different kind of an offering.\"\n\nThe first class in St. Paul graduated with pride, and the students were motivated to start work, Temali said.\n\n\"And then we looked at each other said: Who’s going to get them a loan?\"\n\nSo they added another component to the class: coordinating with banks.\n\nTwenty-three years later, Temali's program has trained 5,000 low-income, mostly minority residents, launching about 1,000 businesses, about 450 of which are still in place today in some of St. Paul's poorest neighborhoods, Temali said.\n\nThe effect is creating a generation of role models, and the return of hope, Temali said.\n\n\"People start believing and can pivot a negative perception of a community to a positive one,\" he said. \"In sports, they call it momentum. If you've got a team losing all the time, their heads always down, nobody goes to the game because you know they’re going to lose. The opposite is also true.\"\n\nThe results are tangible: For every $1 spent on Neighborhood Development Center programs targeting inner-city entrepreneurs, $28 is returned every year to the neighborhoods through payroll, rent, taxes and other expenditures, according to a 2012 commissioned evaluation of Neighborhood Development Center by Wilder Research, an organization that assesses social impacts.\n\nSixty percent of the supported new businesses in St. Paul fill a formerly vacant property, helping to transform blighted neighborhoods, Temali said. Some businesses, like barbershops or coffee shops, also provide new community gathering places.\n\nSome St. Paul neighborhoods with business investment have seen crime lowered, Temali said.\n\n\"I’m not the guy out there at 8 o'clock at night doing anything to bring down crime, but maybe the hair salon or baker is,\" Temali said. \"They’re the ones on the front lines.\"\n\nA business plan for Wilmington\n\nDuring a class on accounting last week, students listened intently to instructor Jerome Stanley, owner of the Simply Styling hair salon in Wilmington.\n\n\"(Entrepreneurs) fall into the trap of not taking the business of their business seriously,\" he told the class. \"Anybody can make a glass of water, but if you don’t know how to manage that glass of water and use the right accounting, then you’re going to have a problem.\"\n\nIn that classroom, the students' goals are diverse. Michael L. Lewis Jr. is trying to develop his handcrafted bow tie business. Jeremy Hebbel, co-owner of the event management company Gable Music Ventures, wants to expand the scope of the Ladybug Festival, a female-focused music event.\n\n“We’ve been doing the event for five years – without a business plan,\" Hebbel said. \"It was interesting to come in and be like, wow, we really should’ve done this at the beginning.”\n\nOne of the students, Nasaii Oliver, is only 15. He started his lemonade business when he was 12, setting up a stand at Jessup Street and Vandever Avenue.\n\n\"I was already selling it person to person, and now I want to wholesale it,\" he said.\n\nKenisha Sutherland, who goes by the name Chef ThugLife, wants to open a sandwich shop on the west side of Wilmington. The well-traveled 24-year-old said she wants to bring the flavors of the world to the city.\n\n\"There are certain things that people in Wilmington don’t get to experience because they don’t see certain things,\" she said. \"I want to be able to bring flavors from different countries and different places I go and bring that back to Wilmington to show people, this flavor came from here.\"\n\nMcCafferty said he is looking forward to the next step for the inaugural class, reaching out to lenders.\n\n\"By the time you’ve put all these weeks together, now you’ve got a business plan, and that’s what we want. That’s the business plan I can take to the banks and some of the funders.\"\n\nThe program has the support of local officals. Gov. John Carney, County Executive Matt Meyer and Mayor Mike Purzycki spoke at a kickoff event on Tuesday. Purzycki commended the entrepreneurs on taking a risk.\n\n\"To go out there and do it yourself, everyone needs a little help,\" Purzycki said. \"It's nice to have someone to give you a start. That's important.\"\n\nSince starting Launcher, Morales said she has already made big changes to her business. Angelica's Housekeeping has become Angelica's Cleaning Service to welcome commercial clients. She's exploring her options for accounting and insurance, writing a formal business plan to present to banks and marketing herself.\n\n\"Now we don’t park our car in the (customer's) driveway,\" she said, showing off her new branded uniform. \"I park on the street so that people can see.\"\n\nApplications for future programs can be submitted through LauncherDE.org.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at cjedra@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2837 or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/04"}]}

We are not just slave states in the American South. We are not just lynching states. We are not just segregation states. We are more than that. The people are more than that.

Not so much to visit with Disney's characters brought to life, but to swim at the hotel's pool. The day that should have been an unforgettable memory of joy as they splashed into the waters was quickly soured forever — all because they were black.\n\nStevenson recounted the memory to a packed congregation Sunday afternoon for the annual Laymen's Fellowship Black History Program hosted by the First Congregational Christian Church. His theme was \"Justice for All.\"\n\nWhite families began screaming and yanking their children out of the pool as one man turned to a confused Stevenson who asked what was wrong. \"You're wrong,\" the man said and humiliated Stevenson by using a racial slur.\n\nIt was just one of several stories Stevenson told about his own upbringing and professional experiences that prove America must change its narrative about racism, Stevenson said. The nation's great evil was not slavery, but rather the \"ideology of white supremacy\" he said and in order to bring about true freedom for the African American community it must be confronted.\n\nAs the founder and executive director for the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, he has become recognized worldwide as a public interest lawyer who works to defend the poor, the incarcerated, the condemned and \"the broken.\" He was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world and served on President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nHe began his message by saying that the work of bringing about true justice for the black community it not done. While they can celebrate successes such as electing the first black president and having more black trial judges and black professionals in Montgomery's history, there is still a broken justice system and systematic racism that must be dealt with he said.\n\nNationwide, the number of inmates in prison has grown from 300,000 in 1972 to 2.3 million, 6 million people are currently on probation or parole and 70 million people have been arrested, marring their chances of getting a job or voting — many of whom are black — Stevenson said.\n\n\"People came, the president came in 2015 to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They wanted to commemorate the historic march that led to the Voting Rights Act and it was glorious to see, but most of them had no idea that when they crossed that bridge and left Montgomery, they were leaving a state where 30 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote because of a criminal investigation,\" Steven said.\n\n\"Our silence means there is more work to be done.\"\n\nHe challenged the crowd to become uncomfortable in that work of bringing about more positive change.\n\nStevenson's greatest concern is that those, like the families who yanked their children out of the pool after he and his sister jumped in, are not having the same discussions as he and others are who are fighting for equal justice. If discussions are not made across the board, change cannot happen he said.\n\n\"We have a identify crisis in this country. I don't think we're free,\" Stevenson said. \"We can do things our forefathers couldn't do, but we are burdened by our history of racial inequality. It's like smog. It's in the air and we've been breathing it our whole lives.\n\n\"It's created barriers to overcome and we haven't talked about things that we need to talk about like the genocide of the Native Americans through our wars, famine and disease. We used racial difference to justify it, just like the same racial narrative was used to justify slavery.\"\n\nIn order to truly be free, he told the audience to make sure the decades of terrorism from the Klu Klux Klan, the lynchings, the slave trading in Montgomery and the beatings are openly talked about. That's why Stevenson's EJI is building a memorial in Montgomery devoted to 4,075 African Americans who were killed by lynching from 1877 to 1950 according to the nonprofit's research.\n\nPlans are also underway to open a museum near the memorial in downtown Montgomery that tells the history of blacks in America from slavery to the present.\n\nHis charge Sunday was to be committed to the cause.\n\n\"I don't know of any time in history when the fight against things that were not right, was comfortable,\" he said. \"Let's be committed to caring for our poor and our incarcerated ... only then can we be free.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/02/equal-justice-initiative-considers-montgomery-expansion-restaurant-retail-buys-city-land/1496588002/", "title": "Equal Justice Initiative considers expansion downtown, retail space ...", "text": "The rolling success of the Equal Justice Initiative's museum and memorial may soon bring more downtown expansion.\n\nThe Montgomery City Council approved the sale of a parking lot downtown near Riverwalk Stadium for $900,000 to the civil rights nonprofit.

The nonprofit has 30 days to back out of the deal and 30 days to close. If all goes according to plan, McLeod said construction would likely begin at the beginning of 2019.\n\nThe city learned about the plans after McLeod talked with EJI Executive Director Bryan Stevenson, who he said \"was talking about the overwhelming success that they have had with the memorial and the museum.”\n\nStevenson recently said at a Chamber of Commerce event that estimates have shown that more than 200,000 visitors have gone through EJI's Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice since their opening in late April.

In 2015, Google.org gave $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative to help fund a national memorial for lynching victims that the Equal Justice Initiative is building on six acres of vacant land in downtown Montgomery and a museum on the country's racial history planned for the group's headquarters that was once a slave warehouse.\n\n\"We want to change how we think about this era in America,\" Stevenson said.\n\nDoria Dee Johnson's great-great-grandfather, Anthony Crawford, a father of 13 who started a school for black children and a successful businessman who owned 427 acres of prime cotton land in Abbeville, NC, was lynched in 1916 after arguing with a white store owner who did not want to pay him a fair price for his cotton seed.\n\nJohnson, an activist and PhD candidate in American history at the University of Wisconsin, says the trauma of lynchings created silence. This new digital platform, with its capacity to reach millions, is now helping to break it.\n\nRELATED:\n\nGoogle gives $1M to Bryan Stevenson's racial justice effort\n\nGoogle pledges $11.5M to fight racial bias in policing, sentencing\n\nBryan Stevenson to Silicon Valley: Go into communities\n\nPolicing in America\n\nBlack troops as much as twice as likely to be punished by commanders, courts\n\nVisitors to the website can search a map of 4,300 lynchings in 20 states and hear how Elizabeth Lawrence, a school teacher in Alabama, was murdered in 1933 for reprimanding white schoolchildren for throwing rocks at her. Or how in 1893, 17-year-old Henry Smith, suspected of killing a white girl, was burned alive before a mob of 10,000 in Texas, his ashes and bones sold as souvenirs.\n\nAnother map shows the seismic population shift of the Great Migration as families were forced to leave to escape racial violence. A century ago nearly all African Americans lived in the South. By 1970 most lived outside of the South, many of them in industrial cities in the North and the West.\n\nOral histories, and a short documentary Uprooted, told from the perspective of descendants, examine how the terror of the past lives on for generations of African-American families. A high school lesson plan brings together findings from the lynching report with content from the digital platform to show how lynchings enforced decades of racial segregation.\n\n\"I just know that we have to keep remembering, to keep telling the story,\" says Tarabu Betserai Kirkland recounts during one of the oral histories.\n\nHis 109-year-old mother and her family had to leave their home and everything they owned in Mississippi in 1915 when she was seven years old because of a lynching threat, only to be terrorized by race riots and white vigilantes in Illinois and chased out of Ohio by klansmen who burned a cross on their lawn as she hid under the bed. A family friend, John Hartfield, who decided to return to Mississippi, was hung and shot before his body was burned before a mob of 10,000 in 1919.\n\n\"How do you get through that if you don't confront history?\" Kirkland said.\n\nFor five years, the Equal Justice Initiative combed through accounts in local newspapers, court records and historical archives and conducted interviews with survivors and the descendants of victims to identify every lynching that took place in 20 states, uncovering some 800 more than previously found.\n\nAfter the report was published, Stevenson says his group heard from hundreds of people whose family members were victims of lynchings and from people whose families participated in those lynchings.\n\nThe study is part of the Equal Justice Initiative's push to trace the roots of racial inequality in the United States from slavery to mass incarceration.\n\nStevenson says today's police shootings of unarmed African-American men and the mass incarceration of black people are a legacy of slavery and lynching. Black people are seen through a lens of racial difference that presumes their guilt, resulting in wrongful arrests, convictions and death sentences, he says.\n\n\"I think our history has created a kind of smog that we all breathe in. We don't even talk about the fact that we are living in a polluted environment that has been corrupted by this history of all kinds of racial inequality,\" Stevenson says.\n\nGoogle says it worked with the Equal Justice Initiative to create an online space for people to reflect and learn.\n\n\"It was really important to take this data, almost 4,300 human lives lost in this era, and visualize it in a way where it was clear that each data point on this map is a human being, is a family, a broken family,\" said Nick Carbonaro, the project creative lead from Google.\n\nMore than a century ago, Shirah Dedman's great-grandfather, Thomas Miles, a black business owner in Shreveport, La., acquitted by a judge of writing letters to a white woman, was grabbed outside the courthouse by an angry mob and killed. Fear drove his family to Los Angeles.\n\nDedman and her family's journey back to Louisiana, for the first time since her great-grandfather was lynched there, is the subject of Uprooted, a six-minute documentary film on the new website.\n\nA filmmaker in California, Dedman says her mother first told her how her great-grandfather died when Dedman was working on a family tree project in the third grade. Her family has no photographs of him, only a quarter-inch-thick report from the Equal Justice Initiative on how in 1912 he was strung up, strangled and shot. Her grandfather was six years old at the time.\n\n\"I am really hoping that sharing my family's story will help,\" Dedman says. \"The only way we are going to heal as a people and as a nation is to confront what has happened to us.\"\n\nIn January, as a Google film crew trailed them, Dedman walked in her great-grandfather's footsteps with her mother and aunt, from the empty, overgrown lot where his home once stood to the spot on main street where he ran a small business to the old tree in a lonely field off a busy highway where her great-grandfather was hung. Dedman says as she approached the tree, her chest felt heavy and she couldn't catch her breath.\n\n\"I don't know what he looks like. Nobody knows what he looks like. But I could still see him. I could imagine him,\" she says. \"You can imagine this man being hoisted up and knowing he's losing his life and that he has a baby and a wife at home.\"\n\nDedman wrapped her arms around the tree trunk. Her mother and aunt filled two glass jars with soil, one for the family to keep, the other for a national memorial. The jars are labeled with the names of the victims, the location of the lynchings and the dates of their deaths.\n\nDedman says as she looked at the spot where her family once lived in Shreveport, tears filled her eyes but her mother was smiling.\n\n\"It looked like you were home,\" she told her mother afterwards.

But he thought it was important, so he hoped people would make the trip to Montgomery to visit and learn.\n\nMore than 400,000 came in the first year, from around the world.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the memorial and museum, Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative is busy opening two new sites in Montgomery and planning memorials for 1,600 more lynching victims, all while adjusting to the huge crowds. “We didn’t plan on a lot of things because we didn’t anticipate this kind of response,” Stevenson said. “I mean, we hoped for it, but we didn’t plan on it. So, it’s been really exciting, but challenging.”\n\nThey’ve bought the 401 N. Perry St. site next to Riverwalk Stadium and are building an expansive facility there to streamline things. EJI’s ticket center and its gift shop and café, which are housed in separate spaces, will move to the new building. There’ll be expanded shuttle service, it’ll have parking for visitors, and there are plans to bring in a new restaurant.\n\n“If you have 3,000 people visiting the sites during the day, they have to have places to eat,” Stevenson said. “So, we’re going to try to bring some added opportunities for food, not just for our visitors but for everybody in downtown Montgomery.”\n\nThe building’s focal point will be a tribute to 1,600 more lynching victims.\n\nEXCLUSIVE COVERAGE: Legacy of Lynchings: America's history of racial terror\n\nThe hanging pillars of The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which is a little less than a mile away, honors those who were lynched from 1877 to 1950. The new building will focus on people who were lynched from 1865 to 1877.\n\nOn Monday, EJI will dedicate a separate memorial to people lynched in the 1950s. Some of the victims’ family members plan to attend the dedication.\n\nIt stands outside the newly opened Peace and Justice Memorial Center, across the street from the original memorial. EJI said the center is meant to be a place where people can learn more about the history of race in America as well as the work of EJI itself.\n\nMore:EJI lynching memorial: A place of healing in the Heart of Dixie\n\nIt’s been 30 years since Stevenson founded what became EJI in Montgomery to provide legal assistance to death row inmates, the mentally ill, children being prosecuted as adults and others in need of help. Its advocacy work has saved innocent people from death row and helped change sentencing guidelines for children nationwide.\n\nMuch of that happened after the organization lost its federal funding in 1994. It relaunched operations as a nonprofit and survived on donations from what Stevenson called some “remarkable people” over the next decade. “I’ve always understood that justice is a constant struggle and that we weren’t going to be able to do anything that would help people if we weren’t willing to engage in that struggle,” he said. “We certainly had a lot of ups and downs financially.”\n\nPublic financial forms show those ups and downs, with the EJI mostly hovering around $3 million in revenue and assets through 2013. By the end of 2016, the most recent forms available, that had jumped to nearly $40 million in revenue and more than $57 million in assets. That was two years before the opening of the memorial and museum.\n\nStevenson said the past few years haven’t always made it easy to tackle the legal work.\n\n“It’s been great that we’ve had so many people respond, but in honesty it’s actually made things harder because we’re now trying to manage these incredibly significant cultural spaces,” he said. “… And now we’re in the midst of preparing to manage this level of interest for the long term, which is a really exciting opportunity.”\n\nThat extends to the city as a whole, and particularly Montgomery’s redeveloped downtown.\n\nLocal attractions are seeing a surge in visitors while the city continues to lead the state in hotel occupancy rates and room demand. That last part isn’t necessarily a good thing — Stevenson and city leaders agree that the area needs more hotels. “The good news is we have some coming online,” said Dawn Hathcock of the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMore:Scarred by interstate, Cottage Hill ready for rebirth with EJI memorial\n\nFour are under construction in the blocks around EJI’s facilities, and the area has seen a massive influx of investment and construction in the past decade, including new stores, restaurants and historic attractions.\n\nOther problems remain. “We’ve got a lot of buildings that are unoccupied. We have a lot of spaces that are not utilized. We have a lot of real estate that doesn’t actually contribute to life in the city, either residential or commercial. We haven’t really created the optics that I think we want people to have when they drive into downtown Montgomery off of the interstate,” Stevenson said. “And those opportunities are opportunities that communities all across the country are having to wrestle with.\n\n“A lot of what we’re doing was made harder by the absence of sort of a commitment to a downtown infrastructure that is alive and active, that’s not dormant and just sitting there for decades.”\n\nHathcock compared the infrastructure challenges to the ones that Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, dealt with when those cities had to adjust to a sudden downtown boom. “It’s a good problem to have, but you have to manage it,” she said.\n\nStill, Stevenson said Montgomery seems to be going in the right direction, and that it’s a direction that can serve as a lesson for other places, one about physical and social change.\n\n“If you don’t get to the truth of (history), then you’re not going to create the kind of honest engagement that people need and want. That’s why we’ve tried not to shy away from the historical work we’ve been doing, even when they’re difficult and challenging,” Stevenson said. “But I think that has added interest in what’s going on in Montgomery. It’s enhanced the experience of people who come here in ways I think we should all be proud of.\n\n“There’s a lot of untapped potential that our region offers people in all walks of life. We’ve got a military base, we’ve got state government, we have this rich history, we have beautiful natural resources. We have a community of people who care about service and sharing. All of those elements are critical to create a thriving space. We just have to take advantage of that.”\n\nBrian Edwards contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/18/obama-21st-century-policing-task-force-valerie-jarrett/20598339/", "title": "Obama appoints task force on police practices", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama appointed members of a task force Thursday assigned to recommend police practices that can improve relations between officers and the people they serve, particularly in minority communities.\n\nThe president signed an executive order Thursday creating the Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nThe task force, which includes officials from law enforcement, legal, academic, civil rights and non-profit organizations, will study methods that are working in different places and report back to Obama by March 2.

Stevenson’s work has helped establish the city as a focal point for tough discussions and social progress in a changing nation.\n\nCharles Lee\n\nAfter building his business from a hot dog cart to a popular restaurant, this Chicago transplant started a mentorship program and community center for kids in one of the poorest areas of Montgomery. He now spends most of his time working with them to explore their interests, develop their skills and help prepare them for jobs. There’s a “Jesus Dog” on the menu at his restaurant. Order it and you don’t actually get a hot dog. Instead the money goes to the youth program.\n\nDowntown Business Association\n\nThis group of entrepreneurs, artists and local businesspeople has grown from about a dozen to nearly 150 in just a few years, alongside a resurgent downtown Montgomery. It’s continued to feed those changes by encouraging local owners to partner and share ideas while directly backing events that support a subculture suddenly exploding with young residents and tourists. One of their initiatives created a fund that awards money each month to help make improvements happen.\n\nHyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama\n\nDuring a lean time for the South Korean automaker, and for the industry in general, the local Hyundai assembly plant slowed its production line to keep thousands of full-time workers employed while it adjusts to an SUV-hungry market. Thousands more people continue to work at suppliers across central Alabama that build parts for the plant, and high school and college students here are training to fill some of the employment gaps.\n\nLeadership Montgomery\n\nThrough its classes for young professionals and longtime community leaders, this organization has brought people together, helped bring change to the region and tackled some its toughest problems. Bridging races, ethnicities and other differences, the groups come up with ideas for ways to improve the city and help implement them. One class spawned a downtown New Year’s Eve bash that’s become one of the city’s most popular events. Others have worked on long-term solutions for issues in public schools.\n\nLEDIC Realty\n\nThis Tennessee-based development and management company has launched $37 million effort to reawaken an iconic, 19th century facility built by town founder Daniel Pratt at the heart of Prattville. After years of sitting dormant, an industrial complex nicknamed “the gin shop” is being converted into 147 unique loft apartments. Despite delays, the plan has energized the community’s downtown and created an influx of more business.\n\nMark and Sarah Buller\n\nThe owners of New York’s MarJam Supply Co. are behind a plan to renovate and revitalize a stretch of Dexter Avenue, one of the nation’s most historic streets. The first step made a splashy debut this spring when the former Kress Department Store reopened as a modern loft development, retail center and connecting point for the city’s past and future. More projects are on the way.\n\nUniversity of Alabama Birmingham Medical School\n\nWith the average age of local doctors on the rise, a branch campus opened here in 2014, working with Baptist Health in Montgomery to train the next generation. That happened in part because data shows physicians are more likely to practice in the area where they trained, even when they could make more money elsewhere. Meanwhile, a network of donors stepped up to offer scholarships that encourage those students to fill gaps in the local healthcare landscape, and a clinic opened as part of the partnership between Baptist and UAB.\n\nMontgomery Area Chamber of Commerce\n\nAs one of the most active chambers in the Southeast, this massive group unites local businesspeople to work together in almost every area of River Region development. That includes recruiting new companies and keeping existing ones happy, holding educational programs for startups and working with the area’s military community and minority business owners.

A broadcast journalist. A federal judge. A Nobel Peace Prize laureate. A WNBA player. A lawyer whose clients have included the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. A former governor.\n\nWith the possible exception of longtime television anchor Soledad O'Brien, the seven men and women honored Thursday by the National Civil Rights Museum weren't mainstream celebrities. Past recipients of the museum's annual Freedom Award have included Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Sidney Poitier, Stevie Wonder, the Dalai Lama, and at least three people so famous — Bono, Oprah and Usher — they don't even need last names, but the sold-out 25th anniversary awards ceremony at the 2,000-seat Cannon Center for the Performing Arts focused for the most part on human rights activists whose achievements have surpassed their popular recognition.\n\n\"There's not that 'one name,' but what we have are people who have worked really hard and continue to work really hard in the justic arena,\" said Terri Lee Freeman, president of the museum, constructed around what more than one attendee referred to as the \"sacred ground\" of the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered on April 4, 1968.\n\nHow to navigate the Smithsonian's terrific new African American museum\n\n\"I feel the soul of Martin Luther King around me everywhere here,\" said first-time Memphis visitor and Freedom Award honoree Tawakkol Karman of Yemen, winner of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize. \"He was our soul, our spirit in all 'Arab Spring' countries.\"\n\nPart celebration, part call to action, the Freedom Awards ceremony was a largely riveting production, thanks mainly to the relatively brief but eloquent speeches — inspiring, humbling and chastening in equal measure — of the award recipients.\n\nThe roll call of honorees included:\n\n• Women's National Basketball Association star Swin Cash, 37, a member of two University of Connecticut NCAA basketball championship teams and 2012 Olympic gold medalist who used her popularity as an athlete to promote women's rights, protest the shooting deaths of black men and support the unionization of college athletes.\n\n• Florida attorney Benjamin Crump, 47, in the news in recent months for taking on high-profile, pro bono cases involving Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and other black men, teens and pre-teens killed in confrontations with law enforcement.\n\n• Tawakkol Karman, 37, of Yemen, recipient of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent \"Arab Spring\" activism and her role in promoting women's rights in the Middle East.\n\n• Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Damon Jerome Keith, 94, a federal judge since the Lyndon Johnson administration. Keith is revered for historic rulings involving public housing, education access and — in the Nixon era — illegal wire-tapping. (Keith was the only honoree unable to attend the event.)\n\n• Soledad O'Brien, 50, a longtime television journalist, anchor and producer whose credits include the multi-part CNN series Black in America.\n\n• Social justice lawyer Bryan Stevenson, 56, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, which advocates for prison reform and challenges bias in the criminal justice system.\n\n• Former Mississippi governor William F. Winter, 93, who challenged his state's long history of discrimination by fighting for public primary education and serving on the board of President Clinton's traveling forum on race relations, the \"One America\" initiative.\n\nBefore the ceremony, Crump said his tour of the museum Thursday made him realize the very direct connection between the sanitation strike in Memphis and the Black Lives Matter movement today. He said that when marchers wore \"I AM A MAN\" signs, they were asserting their own dignity and worth, \"they were not saying that, 'You are a not a man.' With Black Lives Matter, they're not saying saying, 'Your life doesn't matter,' they're saying, 'Our lives matter.'\"\n\nAt one point, host Michael Eric Dyson, an author and radio personality, led the crowd in a chant of \"What do we want? Justice? When do we want it? Now!\" The moment recognized this year's Freedom Awards theme — \"And Justice For All\" — while also enlisting the audience as participants in the evening's oratory.\n\nStevenson, who identified himself as the \"great-grandson of enslaved people,\" said: \"We are still not free in this country.\" He said America has failed to reckon with its identity as \"a post-genocidal society\" that \"used the narrative of racial difference to justify the murder of millions of indigenous people ... and this same narrative of racial difference was used to justify ... the ideology of white supremacy that we made up to justify slavery.\" He said his narrative is \"still alive,\" and the basis of laws and systems that promote poverty, ignorance and the mass incarceration of black men.\n\nWilliam Winter — the lone white award recipient — said he grew up as a beneficiary of this system. \"I now look back in disbelief at the unfairness of the racist system of which I was part.\" During his speech, he warned against \"political appeals based on racial demagoguery\"; before the show he said: \"I hope we elect a president next month who will bring us together.\"\n\nKarman struck a similar note when she accepted her award: \"For me, there is no boundary between a racist and a dictator. Racism and dictatorship need each other.\"\n\nThe awards event also included special recognition of \"The Memphis 13,\" the African-American first-graders who desegregated the city's public schools on Oct. 3, 1961, when they began attending classes at formerly all-white Bruce, Gordon, Rozelle and Springdale elementary schools.\n\nThe Freedom Awards ceremony was just one part of a full day of activities for some of the honorees and museum officials. Several award recipients met with school students Thursday morning at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, while the ceremony was followed by a black-tie gala dinner at the Memphis Cook Convention Center.\n\nFollow John Beifuss on Twitter: @JohnBeifuss", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/21"}]}
